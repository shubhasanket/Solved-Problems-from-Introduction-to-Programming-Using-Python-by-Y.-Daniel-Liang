IT WAS THE HOUR BEFORE THE GODS AWAKE
ACROSS THE PATH OF THE DIVINE EVENT
THE HUGE FOREBODING MIND OF NIGHT ALONE
IN HER UNLIT TEMPLE OF ETERNITY
LAY STRETCHED IMMOBILE UPON SILENCE' MARGE
ALMOST ONE FELT OPAQUE IMPENETRABLE
IN THE SOMBRE SYMBOL OF HER EYELESS MUSE
THE ABYSM OF THE UNBODIED INFINITE
A FATHOMLESS ZERO OCCUPIED THE WORLD
A POWER OF FALLEN BOUNDLESS SELF AWAKE
BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE LAST NOTHINGNESS
RECALLING THE TENEBROUS WOMB FROM WHICH IT CAME
TURNED FROM THE INSOLUBLE MYSTERY OF BIRTH
AND THE TARDY PROCESS OF MORTALITY
AND LONGED TO REACH ITS END IN VACANT NOUGHT
AS IN A DARK BEGINNING OF ALL THINGS
A MUTE FEATURELESS SEMBLANCE OF THE UNKNOWN
REPEATING FOR EVER THE UNCONSCIOUS ACT
PROLONGING FOR EVER THE UNSEEING WILL
CRADLED THE COSMIC DROWSE OF IGNORANT FORCE
WHOSE MOVED CREATIVE SLUMBER KINDLES THE SUNS
AND CARRIES OUR LIVES IN ITS SOMNAMBULIST WHIRL
ATHWART THE VAIN ENORMOUS TRANCE OF SPACE
ITS FORMLESS STUPOR WITHOUT MIND OR LIFE
A SHADOW SPINNING THROUGH A SOULLESS VOID
THROWN BACK ONCE MORE INTO UNTHINKING DREAMS
EARTH WHEELED ABANDONED IN THE HOLLOW GULFS
FORGETFUL OF HER SPIRIT AND HER FATE
THE IMPASSIVE SKIES WERE NEUTRAL EMPTY STILL
THEN SOMETHING IN THE INSCRUTABLE DARKNESS STIRRED
A NAMELESS MOVEMENT AN UNTHOUGHT IDEA
2
INSISTENT DISSATISFIED WITHOUT AN AIM
SOMETHING THAT WISHED BUT KNEW NOT HOW TO BE
TEASED THE INCONSCIENT TO WAKE IGNORANCE
A THROE THAT CAME AND LEFT A QUIVERING TRACE
GAVE ROOM FOR AN OLD TIRED WANT UNFILLED
AT PEACE IN ITS SUBCONSCIENT MOONLESS CAVE
TO RAISE ITS HEAD AND LOOK FOR ABSENT LIGHT
STRAINING CLOSED EYES OF VANISHED MEMORY
LIKE ONE WHO SEARCHES FOR A BYGONE SELF
AND ONLY MEETS THE CORPSE OF HIS DESIRE
IT WAS AS THOUGH EVEN IN THIS NOUGHT'S PROFOUND
EVEN IN THIS ULTIMATE DISSOLUTION'S CORE
THERE LURKED AN UNREMEMBERING ENTITY
SURVIVOR OF A SLAIN AND BURIED PAST
CONDEMNED TO RESUME THE EFFORT AND THE PANG
REVIVING IN ANOTHER FRUSTRATE WORLD
AN UNSHAPED CONSCIOUSNESS DESIRED LIGHT
AND A BLANK PRESCIENCE YEARNED TOWARDS DISTANT CHANGE
AS IF A CHILDLIKE FINGER LAID ON A CHEEK
REMINDED OF THE ENDLESS NEED IN THINGS
THE HEEDLESS MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE
AN INFANT LONGING CLUTCHED THE SOMBRE VAST
INSENSIBLY SOMEWHERE A BREACH BEGAN
A LONG LONE LINE OF HESITATING HUE
LIKE A VAGUE SMILE TEMPTING A DESERT HEART
TROUBLED THE FAR RIM OF LIFE'S OBSCURE SLEEP
ARRIVED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF BOUNDLESSNESS
AN EYE OF DEITY PEERED THROUGH THE DUMB DEEPS
A SCOUT IN A RECONNAISSANCE FROM THE SUN
IT SEEMED AMID A HEAVY COSMIC REST
THE TORPOR OF A SICK AND WEARY WORLD
TO SEEK FOR A SPIRIT SOLE AND DESOLATE
TOO FALLEN TO RECOLLECT FORGOTTEN BLISS
INTERVENING IN A MINDLESS UNIVERSE
ITS MESSAGE CREPT THROUGH THE RELUCTANT HUSH
CALLING THE ADVENTURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND JOY
3
AND CONQUERING NATURE'S DISILLUSIONED BREAST
COMPELLED RENEWED CONSENT TO SEE AND FEEL
A THOUGHT WAS SOWN IN THE UNSOUNDED VOID
A SENSE WAS BORN WITHIN THE DARKNESS' DEPTHS
A MEMORY QUIVERED IN THE HEART OF TIME
AS IF A SOUL LONG DEAD WERE MOVED TO LIVE
BUT THE OBLIVION THAT SUCCEEDS THE FALL
HAD BLOTTED THE CROWDED TABLETS OF THE PAST
AND ALL THAT WAS DESTROYED MUST BE REBUILT
AND OLD EXPERIENCE LABOURED OUT ONCE MORE
ALL CAN BE DONE IF THE GOD-TOUCH IS THERE
A HOPE STOLE IN THAT HARDLY DARED TO BE
AMID THE NIGHT'S FORLORN INDIFFERENCE
AS IF SOLICITED IN AN ALIEN WORLD
WITH TIMID AND HAZARDOUS INSTINCTIVE GRACE
ORPHANED AND DRIVEN OUT TO SEEK A HOME
AN ERRANT MARVEL WITH NO PLACE TO LIVE
INTO A FAR-OFF NOOK OF HEAVEN THERE CAME
A SLOW MIRACULOUS GESTURE'S DIM APPEAL
THE PERSISTENT THRILL OF A TRANSFIGURING TOUCH
PERSUADED THE INERT BLACK QUIETUDE
AND BEAUTY AND WONDER DISTURBED THE FIELDS OF GOD
A WANDERING HAND OF PALE ENCHANTED LIGHT
THAT GLOWED ALONG A FADING MOMENT'S BRINK
FIXED WITH GOLD PANEL AND OPALESCENT HINGE
A GATE OF DREAMS AJAR ON MYSTERY'S VERGE
ONE LUCENT CORNER WINDOWING HIDDEN THINGS
FORCED THE WORLD'S BLIND IMMENSITY TO SIGHT
THE DARKNESS FAILED AND SLIPPED LIKE A FALLING CLOAK
FROM THE RECLINING BODY OF A GOD
THEN THROUGH THE PALLID RIFT THAT SEEMED AT FIRST
HARDLY ENOUGH FOR A TRICKLE FROM THE SUNS
OUTPOURED THE REVELATION AND THE FLAME
THE BRIEF PERPETUAL SIGN RECURRED ABOVE
A GLAMOUR FROM UNREACHED TRANSCENDENCES
IRIDESCENT WITH THE GLORY OF THE UNSEEN
4
A MESSAGE FROM THE UNKNOWN IMMORTAL LIGHT
ABLAZE UPON CREATION'S QUIVERING EDGE
DAWN BUILT HER AURA OF MAGNIFICENT HUES
AND BURIED ITS SEED OF GRANDEUR IN THE HOURS
AN INSTANT'S VISITOR THE GODHEAD SHONE
ON LIFE'S THIN BORDER AWHILE THE VISION STOOD
AND BENT OVER EARTH'S PONDERING FOREHEAD CURVE
INTERPRETING A RECONDITE BEAUTY AND BLISS
IN COLOUR'S HIEROGLYPHS OF MYSTIC SENSE
IT WROTE THE LINES OF A SIGNIFICANT MYTH
TELLING OF A GREATNESS OF SPIRITUAL DAWNS
A BRILLIANT CODE PENNED WITH THE SKY FOR PAGE
ALMOST THAT DAY THE EPIPHANY WAS DISCLOSED
OF WHICH OUR THOUGHTS AND HOPES ARE SIGNAL FLARES
A LONELY SPLENDOUR FROM THE INVISIBLE GOAL
ALMOST WAS FLUNG ON THE OPAQUE INANE
ONCE MORE A TREAD PERTURBED THE VACANT VASTS
INFINITY'S CENTRE A FACE OF RAPTUROUS CALM
PARTED THE ETERNAL LIDS THAT OPEN HEAVEN
A FORM FROM FAR BEATITUDES SEEMED TO NEAR
AMBASSADRESS TWIXT ETERNITY AND CHANGE
THE OMNISCIENT GODDESS LEANED ACROSS THE BREADTHS
THAT WRAP THE FATED JOURNEYINGS OF THE STARS
AND SAW THE SPACES READY FOR HER FEET
ONCE SHE HALF LOOKED BEHIND FOR HER VEILED SUN
THEN THOUGHTFUL WENT TO HER IMMORTAL WORK
EARTH FELT THE IMPERISHABLE'S PASSAGE CLOSE
THE WAKING EAR OF NATURE HEARD HER STEPS
AND WIDENESS TURNED TO HER ITS LIMITLESS EYE
AND SCATTERED ON SEALED DEPTHS HER LUMINOUS SMILE
KINDLED TO FIRE THE SILENCE OF THE WORLDS
ALL GREW A CONSECRATION AND A RITE
AIR WAS A VIBRANT LINK BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN
THE WIDE-WINGED HYMN OF A GREAT PRIESTLY WIND
AROSE AND FAILED UPON THE ALTAR HILLS
THE HIGH BOUGHS PRAYED IN A REVEALING SKY
5
HERE WHERE OUR HALF-LIT IGNORANCE SKIRTS THE GULFS
ON THE DUMB BOSOM OF THE AMBIGUOUS EARTH
HERE WHERE ONE KNOWS NOT EVEN THE STEP IN FRONT
AND TRUTH HAS HER THRONE ON THE SHADOWY BACK OF DOUBT
ON THIS ANGUISHED AND PRECARIOUS FIELD OF TOIL
OUTSPREAD BENEATH SOME LARGE INDIFFERENT GAZE
IMPARTIAL WITNESS OF OUR JOY AND BALE
OUR PROSTRATE SOIL BORE THE AWAKENING RAY
HERE TOO THE VISION AND PROPHETIC GLEAM
LIT INTO MIRACLES COMMON MEANINGLESS SHAPES
THEN THE DIVINE AFFLATUS SPENT WITHDREW
UNWANTED FADING FROM THE MORTAL'S RANGE
A SACRED YEARNING LINGERED IN ITS TRACE
THE WORSHIP OF A PRESENCE AND A POWER
TOO PERFECT TO BE HELD BY DEATH-BOUND HEARTS
THE PRESCIENCE OF A MARVELLOUS BIRTH TO COME
ONLY A LITTLE THE GOD-LIGHT CAN STAY
SPIRITUAL BEAUTY ILLUMINING HUMAN SIGHT
LINES WITH ITS PASSION AND MYSTERY MATTER'S MASK
AND SQUANDERS ETERNITY ON A BEAT OF TIME
AS WHEN A SOUL DRAWS NEAR THE SILL OF BIRTH
ADJOINING MORTAL TIME TO TIMELESSNESS
A SPARK OF DEITY LOST IN MATTER'S CRYPT
ITS LUSTRE VANISHES IN THE INCONSCIENT PLANES
THAT TRANSITORY GLOW OF MAGIC FIRE
SO NOW DISSOLVED IN BRIGHT ACCUSTOMED AIR
THE MESSAGE CEASED AND WANED THE MESSENGER
THE SINGLE CALL THE UNCOMPANIONED POWER
DREW BACK INTO SOME FAR-OFF SECRET WORLD
THE HUE AND MARVEL OF THE SUPERNAL BEAM
SHE LOOKED NO MORE ON OUR MORTALITY
THE EXCESS OF BEAUTY NATURAL TO GOD-KIND
COULD NOT UPHOLD ITS CLAIM ON TIME-BORN EYES
TOO MYSTIC-REAL FOR SPACE-TENANCY
HER BODY OF GLORY WAS EXPUNGED FROM HEAVEN
THE RARITY AND WONDER LIVED NO MORE
6
THERE WAS THE COMMON LIGHT OF EARTHLY DAY
AFFRANCHISED FROM THE RESPITE OF FATIGUE
ONCE MORE THE RUMOUR OF THE SPEED OF LIFE
PURSUED THE CYCLES OF HER BLINDED QUEST
ALL SPRANG TO THEIR UNVARYING DAILY ACTS
THE THOUSAND PEOPLES OF THE SOIL AND TREE
OBEYED THE UNFORESEEING INSTANT'S URGE
AND LEADER HERE WITH HIS UNCERTAIN MIND
ALONE WHO STARES AT THE FUTURE'S COVERED FACE
MAN LIFTED UP THE BURDEN OF HIS FATE
AND SAVITRI TOO AWOKE AMONG THESE TRIBES
THAT HASTENED TO JOIN THE BRILLIANT SUMMONER'S CHANT
AND LURED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE APPARENT WAYS
ACCLAIMED THEIR PORTION OF EPHEMERAL JOY
AKIN TO THE ETERNITY WHENCE SHE CAME
NO PART SHE TOOK IN THIS SMALL HAPPINESS
A MIGHTY STRANGER IN THE HUMAN FIELD
THE EMBODIED GUEST WITHIN MADE NO RESPONSE
THE CALL THAT WAKES THE LEAP OF HUMAN MIND
ITS CHEQUERED EAGER MOTION OF PURSUIT
ITS FLUTTERING-HUED ILLUSION OF DESIRE
VISITED HER HEART LIKE A SWEET ALIEN NOTE
TIME'S MESSAGE OF BRIEF LIGHT WAS NOT FOR HER
IN HER THERE WAS THE ANGUISH OF THE GODS
IMPRISONED IN OUR TRANSIENT HUMAN MOULD
THE DEATHLESS CONQUERED BY THE DEATH OF THINGS
A VASTER NATURE'S JOY HAD ONCE BEEN HERS
BUT LONG COULD KEEP NOT ITS GOLD HEAVENLY HUE
OR STAND UPON THIS BRITTLE EARTHLY BASE
A NARROW MOVEMENT ON TIME'S DEEP ABYSM
LIFE'S FRAGILE LITTLENESS DENIED THE POWER
THE PROUD AND CONSCIOUS WIDENESS AND THE BLISS
SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER INTO THE HUMAN FORM
THE CALM DELIGHT THAT WEDS ONE SOUL TO ALL
THE KEY TO THE FLAMING DOORS OF ECSTASY
7
EARTH'S GRAIN THAT NEEDS THE SAP OF PLEASURE AND TEARS
REJECTED THE UNDYING RAPTURE'S BOON
OFFERED TO THE DAUGHTER OF INFINITY
HER PASSION-FLOWER OF LOVE AND DOOM SHE GAVE
IN VAIN NOW SEEMED THE SPLENDID SACRIFICE
A PRODIGAL OF HER RICH DIVINITY
HER SELF AND ALL SHE WAS SHE HAD LENT TO MEN
HOPING HER GREATER BEING TO IMPLANT
AND IN THEIR BODY'S LIVES ACCLIMATISE
THAT HEAVEN MIGHT NATIVE GROW ON MORTAL SOIL
HARD IS IT TO PERSUADE EARTH-NATURE'S CHANGE
MORTALITY BEARS ILL THE ETERNAL'S TOUCH
IT FEARS THE PURE DIVINE INTOLERANCE
OF THAT ASSAULT OF ETHER AND OF FIRE
IT MURMURS AT ITS SORROWLESS HAPPINESS
ALMOST WITH HATE REPELS THE LIGHT IT BRINGS
IT TREMBLES AT ITS NAKED POWER OF TRUTH
AND THE MIGHT AND SWEETNESS OF ITS ABSOLUTE VOICE
INFLICTING ON THE HEIGHTS THE ABYSM'S LAW
IT SULLIES WITH ITS MIRE HEAVEN'S MESSENGERS
ITS THORNS OF FALLEN NATURE ARE THE DEFENCE
IT TURNS AGAINST THE SAVIOUR HANDS OF GRACE
IT MEETS THE SONS OF GOD WITH DEATH AND PAIN
A GLORY OF LIGHTNINGS TRAVERSING THE EARTH-SCENE
THEIR SUN-THOUGHTS FADING DARKENED BY IGNORANT MINDS
THEIR WORK BETRAYED THEIR GOOD TO EVIL TURNED
THE CROSS THEIR PAYMENT FOR THE CROWN THEY GAVE
ONLY THEY LEAVE BEHIND A SPLENDID NAME
A FIRE HAS COME AND TOUCHED MEN'S HEARTS AND GONE
A FEW HAVE CAUGHT FLAME AND RISEN TO GREATER LIFE
TOO UNLIKE THE WORLD SHE CAME TO HELP AND SAVE
HER GREATNESS WEIGHED UPON ITS IGNORANT BREAST
AND FROM ITS DIM CHASMS WELLED A DIRE RETURN
A PORTION OF ITS SORROW STRUGGLE FALL
TO LIVE WITH GRIEF TO CONFRONT DEATH ON HER ROAD
THE MORTAL'S LOT BECAME THE IMMORTAL'S SHARE
8
THUS TRAPPED IN THE GIN OF EARTHLY DESTINIES
AWAITING HER ORDEAL'S HOUR ABODE
OUTCAST FROM HER INBORN FELICITY
ACCEPTING LIFE'S OBSCURE TERRESTRIAL ROBE
HIDING HERSELF EVEN FROM THOSE SHE LOVED
THE GODHEAD GREATER BY A HUMAN FATE
A DARK FOREKNOWLEDGE SEPARATED HER
FROM ALL OF WHOM SHE WAS THE STAR AND STAY
TOO GREAT TO IMPART THE PERIL AND THE PAIN
IN HER TORN DEPTHS SHE KEPT THE GRIEF TO COME
AS ONE WHO WATCHING OVER MEN LEFT BLIND
TAKES UP THE LOAD OF AN UNWITTING RACE
HARBOURING A FOE WHOM WITH HER HEART SHE MUST FEED
UNKNOWN HER ACT UNKNOWN THE DOOM SHE FACED
UNHELPED SHE MUST FORESEE AND DREAD AND DARE
THE LONG-FOREKNOWN AND FATAL MORN WAS HERE
BRINGING A NOON THAT SEEMED LIKE EVERY NOON
FOR NATURE WALKS UPON HER MIGHTY WAY
UNHEEDING WHEN SHE BREAKS A SOUL A LIFE
LEAVING HER SLAIN BEHIND SHE TRAVELS ON
MAN ONLY MARKS AND GOD'S ALL-SEEING EYES
EVEN IN THIS MOMENT OF HER SOUL'S DESPAIR
IN ITS GRIM RENDEZVOUS WITH DEATH AND FEAR
NO CRY BROKE FROM HER LIPS NO CALL FOR AID
SHE TOLD THE SECRET OF HER WOE TO NONE
CALM WAS HER FACE AND COURAGE KEPT HER MUTE
YET ONLY HER OUTWARD SELF SUFFERED AND STROVE
EVEN HER HUMANITY WAS HALF DIVINE
HER SPIRIT OPENED TO THE SPIRIT IN ALL
HER NATURE FELT ALL NATURE AS ITS OWN
APART LIVING WITHIN ALL LIVES SHE BORE
ALOOF SHE CARRIED IN HERSELF THE WORLD
HER DREAD WAS ONE WITH THE GREAT COSMIC DREAD
HER STRENGTH WAS FOUNDED ON THE COSMIC MIGHTS
THE UNIVERSAL MOTHER'S LOVE WAS HERS
AGAINST THE EVIL AT LIFE'S AFFLICTED ROOTS
9
HER OWN CALAMITY ITS PRIVATE SIGN
OF HER PANGS SHE MADE A MYSTIC POIGNANT SWORD
A SOLITARY MIND A WORLD-WIDE HEART
TO THE LONE IMMORTAL'S UNSHARED WORK SHE ROSE
AT FIRST LIFE GRIEVED NOT IN HER BURDENED BREAST
ON THE LAP OF EARTH'S ORIGINAL SOMNOLENCE
INERT RELEASED INTO FORGETFULNESS
PRONE IT REPOSED UNCONSCIOUS ON MIND'S VERGE
OBTUSE AND TRANQUIL LIKE THE STONE AND STAR
IN A DEEP CLEFT OF SILENCE TWIXT TWO REALMS
SHE LAY REMOTE FROM GRIEF UNSAWN BY CARE
NOTHING RECALLING OF THE SORROW HERE
THEN A SLOW FAINT REMEMBRANCE SHADOWLIKE MOVED
AND SIGHING SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HER BOSOM
AND RECOGNISED THE CLOSE AND LINGERING ACHE
DEEP QUIET OLD MADE NATURAL TO ITS PLACE
BUT KNEW NOT WHY IT WAS THERE NOR WHENCE IT CAME
THE POWER THAT KINDLES MIND WAS STILL WITHDRAWN
HEAVY UNWILLING WERE LIFE'S SERVITORS
LIKE WORKERS WITH NO WAGES OF DELIGHT
SULLEN THE TORCH OF SENSE REFUSED TO BURN
THE UNASSISTED BRAIN FOUND NOT ITS PAST
ONLY A VAGUE EARTH-NATURE HELD THE FRAME
BUT NOW SHE STIRRED HER LIFE SHARED THE COSMIC LOAD
AT THE SUMMONS OF HER BODY'S VOICELESS CALL
HER STRONG FAR-WINGING SPIRIT TRAVELLED BACK
BACK TO THE YOKE OF IGNORANCE AND FATE
BACK TO THE LABOUR AND STRESS OF MORTAL DAYS
LIGHTING A PATHWAY THROUGH STRANGE SYMBOL DREAMS
ACROSS THE EBBING OF THE SEAS OF SLEEP
HER HOUSE OF NATURE FELT AN UNSEEN SWAY
ILLUMINED SWIFTLY WERE LIFE'S DARKENED ROOMS
AND MEMORY'S CASEMENTS OPENED ON THE HOURS
AND THE TIRED FEET OF THOUGHT APPROACHED HER DOORS
ALL CAME BACK TO HER EARTH AND LOVE AND DOOM
THE ANCIENT DISPUTANTS ENCIRCLED HER
10
LIKE GIANT FIGURES WRESTLING IN THE NIGHT
THE GODHEADS FROM THE DIM INCONSCIENT BORN
AWOKE TO STRUGGLE AND THE PANG DIVINE
AND IN THE SHADOW OF HER FLAMING HEART
AT THE SOMBRE CENTRE OF THE DIRE DEBATE
A GUARDIAN OF THE UNCONSOLED ABYSS
INHERITING THE LONG AGONY OF THE GLOBE
A STONE-STILL FIGURE OF HIGH AND GODLIKE PAIN
STARED INTO SPACE WITH FIXED REGARDLESS EYES
THAT SAW GRIEF'S TIMELESS DEPTHS BUT NOT LIFE'S GOAL
AFFLICTED BY HIS HARSH DIVINITY
BOUND TO HIS THRONE HE WAITED UNAPPEASED
THE DAILY OBLATION OF HER UNWEPT TEARS
ALL THE FIERCE QUESTION OF MAN'S HOURS RELIVED
THE SACRIFICE OF SUFFERING AND DESIRE
EARTH OFFERS TO THE IMMORTAL ECSTASY
BEGAN AGAIN BENEATH THE ETERNAL HAND
AWAKE SHE ENDURED THE MOMENTS' SERRIED MARCH
AND LOOKED ON THIS GREEN SMILING DANGEROUS WORLD
AND HEARD THE IGNORANT CRY OF LIVING THINGS
AMID THE TRIVIAL SOUNDS THE UNCHANGING SCENE
HER SOUL AROSE CONFRONTING TIME AND FATE
IMMOBILE IN HERSELF SHE GATHERED FORCE
THIS WAS THE DAY WHEN SATYAVAN MUST DIE
11
AWHILE WITHDRAWN IN SECRET FIELDS OF THOUGHT
HER MIND MOVED IN A MANY-IMAGED PAST
THAT LIVED AGAIN AND SAW ITS END APPROACH
DYING IT LIVED IMPERISHABLY IN HER
TRANSIENT AND VANISHING FROM TRANSIENT EYES
INVISIBLE A FATEFUL GHOST OF SELF
IT BORE THE FUTURE ON ITS PHANTOM BREAST
ALONG THE FLEETING EVENT'S FAR-BACKWARD TRAIL
REGRESSED THE STREAM OF THE INSISTENT HOURS
AND ON THE BANK OF THE MYSTERIOUS FLOOD
PEOPLED WITH WELL-LOVED FORMS NOW SEEN NO MORE
AND THE SUBTLE IMAGES OF THINGS THAT WERE
HER WITNESS SPIRIT STOOD REVIEWING TIME
ALL THAT SHE ONCE HAD HOPED AND DREAMED AND BEEN
FLEW PAST HER EAGLE-WINGED THROUGH MEMORY'S SKIES
AS IN A MANY-HUED FLAMING INNER DAWN
HER LIFE'S BROAD HIGHWAYS AND ITS SWEET BYPATHS
LAY MAPPED TO HER SUN-CLEAR RECORDING VIEW
FROM THE BRIGHT COUNTRY OF HER CHILDHOOD'S DAYS
AND THE BLUE MOUNTAINS OF HER SOARING YOUTH
AND THE PARADISE GROVES AND PEACOCK WINGS OF LOVE
TO JOY CLUTCHED UNDER THE SILENT SHADOW OF DOOM
IN A LAST TURN WHERE HEAVEN RACED WITH HELL
TWELVE PASSIONATE MONTHS LED IN A DAY OF FATE
AN ABSOLUTE SUPERNATURAL DARKNESS FALLS
ON MAN SOMETIMES WHEN HE DRAWS NEAR TO GOD
AN HOUR ARRIVES WHEN FAIL ALL NATURE'S MEANS
FORCED OUT FROM THE PROTECTING IGNORANCE
AND FLUNG BACK ON HIS NAKED PRIMAL NEED
HE AT LENGTH MUST CAST FROM HIM HIS SURFACE SOUL
AND BE THE UNGARBED ENTITY WITHIN
12
THAT HOUR HAD FALLEN NOW ON SAVITRI
A POINT SHE HAD REACHED WHERE LIFE MUST BE IN VAIN
OR IN HER UNBORN ELEMENT AWAKE
HER WILL MUST CANCEL HER BODY'S DESTINY
FOR ONLY THE UNBORN SPIRIT'S TIMELESS POWER
CAN LIFT THE YOKE IMPOSED BY BIRTH IN TIME
ONLY THE SELF THAT BUILDS THIS FIGURE OF SELF
CAN RASE THE FIXED INTERMINABLE LINE
THAT JOINS THESE CHANGING NAMES THESE NUMBERLESS LIVES
THESE NEW OBLIVIOUS PERSONALITIES
AND KEEPS STILL LURKING IN OUR CONSCIOUS ACTS
THE TRAIL OF OLD FORGOTTEN THOUGHTS AND DEEDS
DISOWN THE LEGACY OF OUR BURIED SELVES
THE BURDENSOME HEIRSHIP TO OUR VANISHED FORMS
ACCEPTED BLINDLY BY THE BODY AND SOUL
AN EPISODE IN AN UNREMEMBERED TALE
ITS BEGINNING LOST ITS MOTIVE AND PLOT CONCEALED
A ONCE LIVING STORY HAS PREPARED AND MADE
OUR PRESENT FATE CHILD OF PAST ENERGIES
THE FIXITY OF THE COSMIC SEQUENCES
FASTENED WITH HIDDEN INEVITABLE LINKS
SHE MUST DISRUPT DISLODGE BY HER SOUL'S FORCE
HER PAST A BLOCK ON THE IMMORTAL'S ROAD
MAKE A RASED GROUND AND SHAPE ANEW HER FATE
A COLLOQUY OF THE ORIGINAL GODS
MEETING UPON THE BORDERS OF THE UNKNOWN
HER SOUL'S DEBATE WITH EMBODIED NOTHINGNESS
MUST BE WRESTLED OUT ON A DANGEROUS DIM BACKGROUND
HER BEING MUST CONFRONT ITS FORMLESS CAUSE
AGAINST THE UNIVERSE WEIGH ITS SINGLE SELF
ON THE BARE PEAK WHERE SELF IS ALONE WITH NOUGHT
AND LIFE HAS NO SENSE AND LOVE NO PLACE TO STAND
SHE MUST PLEAD HER CASE UPON EXTINCTION'S VERGE
IN THE WORLD'S DEATH-CAVE UPHOLD LIFE'S HELPLESS CLAIM
AND VINDICATE HER RIGHT TO BE AND LOVE
ALTERED MUST BE NATURE'S HARSH ECONOMY
13
ACQUITTANCE SHE MUST WIN FROM HER PAST'S BOND
AN OLD ACCOUNT OF SUFFERING EXHAUST
STRIKE OUT FROM TIME THE SOUL'S LONG COMPOUND DEBT
AND THE HEAVY SERVITUDES OF THE KARMIC GODS
THE SLOW REVENGE OF UNFORGIVING LAW
AND THE DEEP NEED OF UNIVERSAL PAIN
AND HARD SACRIFICE AND TRAGIC CONSEQUENCE
OUT OF A TIMELESS BARRIER SHE MUST BREAK
PENETRATE WITH HER THINKING DEPTHS THE VOID'S MONSTROUS HUSH
LOOK INTO THE LONELY EYES OF IMMORTAL DEATH
AND WITH HER NUDE SPIRIT MEASURE THE INFINITE'S NIGHT
THE GREAT AND DOLOROUS MOMENT NOW WAS CLOSE
A MAILED BATTALION MARCHING TO ITS DOOM
THE LAST LONG DAYS WENT BY WITH HEAVY TRAMP
LONG BUT TOO SOON TO PASS TOO NEAR THE END
ALONE AMID THE MANY FACES LOVED
AWARE AMONG UNKNOWING HAPPY HEARTS
HER ARMOURED SPIRIT KEPT WATCH UPON THE HOURS
LISTENING FOR A FORESEEN TREMENDOUS STEP
IN THE CLOSED BEAUTY OF THE INHUMAN WILDS
A COMBATANT IN SILENT DREADFUL LISTS
THE WORLD UNKNOWING FOR THE WORLD SHE STOOD
NO HELPER HAD SHE SAVE THE STRENGTH WITHIN
THERE WAS NO WITNESS OF TERRESTRIAL EYES
THE GODS ABOVE AND NATURE SOLE BELOW
WERE THE SPECTATORS OF THAT MIGHTY STRIFE
AROUND HER WERE THE AUSTERE SKY-POINTING HILLS
AND THE GREEN MURMUROUS BROAD DEEP-THOUGHTED WOODS
MUTTERED INCESSANTLY THEIR MUFFLED SPELL
A DENSE MAGNIFICENT COLOURED SELF-WRAPPED LIFE
DRAPED IN THE LEAVES' VIVID EMERALD MONOTONE
AND SET WITH CHEQUERED SUNBEAMS AND BLITHE FLOWERS
IMMURED HER DESTINY'S SECLUDED SCENE
THERE HAD SHE GROWN TO THE STATURE OF HER SPIRIT
THE GENIUS OF TITANIC SILENCES
STEEPING HER SOUL IN ITS WIDE LONELINESS
14
HAD SHOWN TO HER HER SELF'S BARE REALITY
AND MATED HER WITH HER ENVIRONMENT
ITS SOLITUDE GREATENED HER HUMAN HOURS
WITH A BACKGROUND OF THE ETERNAL AND UNIQUE
A FORCE OF SPARE DIRECT NECESSITY
REDUCED THE HEAVY FRAMEWORK OF MAN'S DAYS
AND HIS OVERBURDENING MASS OF OUTWARD NEEDS
TO A FIRST THIN STRIP OF SIMPLE ANIMAL WANTS
AND THE MIGHTY WILDNESS OF THE PRIMITIVE EARTH
AND THE BROODING MULTITUDE OF PATIENT TREES
AND THE MUSING SAPPHIRE LEISURE OF THE SKY
AND THE SOLEMN WEIGHT OF THE SLOWLY-PASSING MONTHS
HAD LEFT IN HER DEEP ROOM FOR THOUGHT AND GOD
THERE WAS HER DRAMA'S RADIANT PROLOGUE LIVED
A SPOT FOR THE ETERNAL'S TREAD ON EARTH
SET IN THE CLOISTRAL YEARNING OF THE WOODS
AND WATCHED BY THE ASPIRATION OF THE PEAKS
APPEARED THROUGH AN AUREATE OPENING IN TIME
WHERE STILLNESS LISTENING FELT THE UNSPOKEN WORD
AND THE HOURS FORGOT TO PASS TOWARDS GRIEF AND CHANGE
HERE WITH THE SUDDENNESS DIVINE ADVENTS HAVE
REPEATING THE MARVEL OF THE FIRST DESCENT
CHANGING TO RAPTURE THE DULL EARTHLY ROUND
LOVE CAME TO HER HIDING THE SHADOW DEATH
WELL MIGHT HE FIND IN HER HIS PERFECT SHRINE
SINCE FIRST THE EARTH-BEING'S HEAVENWARD GROWTH BEGAN
THROUGH ALL THE LONG ORDEAL OF THE RACE
NEVER A RARER CREATURE BORE HIS SHAFT
THAT BURNING TEST OF THE GODHEAD IN OUR PARTS
A LIGHTNING FROM THE HEIGHTS ON OUR ABYSS
ALL IN HER POINTED TO A NOBLER KIND
NEAR TO EARTH'S WIDENESS INTIMATE WITH HEAVEN
EXALTED AND SWIFT HER YOUNG LARGE-VISIONED SPIRIT
VOYAGING THROUGH WORLDS OF SPLENDOUR AND OF CALM
OVERFLEW THE WAYS OF THOUGHT TO UNBORN THINGS
ARDENT WAS HER SELF-POISED UNSTUMBLING WILL
15
HER MIND A SEA OF WHITE SINCERITY
PASSIONATE IN FLOW HAD NOT ONE TURBID WAVE
AS IN A MYSTIC AND DYNAMIC DANCE
A PRIESTESS OF IMMACULATE ECSTASIES
INSPIRED AND RULED FROM TRUTH'S REVEALING VAULT
MOVES IN SOME PROPHET CAVERN OF THE GODS
A HEART OF SILENCE IN THE HANDS OF JOY
INHABITED WITH RICH CREATIVE BEATS
A BODY LIKE A PARABLE OF DAWN
THAT SEEMED A NICHE FOR VEILED DIVINITY
OR GOLDEN TEMPLE-DOOR TO THINGS BEYOND
IMMORTAL RHYTHMS SWAYED IN HER TIME-BORN STEPS
HER LOOK HER SMILE AWOKE CELESTIAL SENSE
EVEN IN EARTH-STUFF AND THEIR INTENSE DELIGHT
POURED A SUPERNAL BEAUTY ON MEN'S LIVES
A WIDE SELF-GIVING WAS HER NATIVE ACT
A MAGNANIMITY AS OF SEA OR SKY
ENVELOPED WITH ITS GREATNESS ALL THAT CAME
AND GAVE A SENSE AS OF A GREATENED WORLD
HER KINDLY CARE WAS A SWEET TEMPERATE SUN
HER HIGH PASSION A BLUE HEAVEN'S EQUIPOISE
AS MIGHT A SOUL FLY LIKE A HUNTED BIRD
ESCAPING WITH TIRED WINGS FROM A WORLD OF STORMS
AND A QUIET REACH LIKE A REMEMBERED BREAST
IN A HAVEN OF SAFETY AND SPLENDID SOFT REPOSE
ONE COULD DRINK LIFE BACK IN STREAMS OF HONEY-FIRE
RECOVER THE LOST HABIT OF HAPPINESS
FEEL HER BRIGHT NATURE'S GLORIOUS AMBIENCE
AND PREEN JOY IN HER WARMTH AND COLOUR'S RULE
A DEEP OF COMPASSION A HUSHED SANCTUARY
HER INWARD HELP UNBARRED A GATE IN HEAVEN
LOVE IN HER WAS WIDER THAN THE UNIVERSE
THE WHOLE WORLD COULD TAKE REFUGE IN HER SINGLE HEART
THE GREAT UNSATISFIED GODHEAD HERE COULD DWELL
VACANT OF THE DWARF SELF'S IMPRISONED AIR
HER MOOD COULD HARBOUR HIS SUBLIMER BREATH
16
SPIRITUAL THAT CAN MAKE ALL THINGS DIVINE
FOR EVEN HER GULFS WERE SECRECIES OF LIGHT
AT ONCE SHE WAS THE STILLNESS AND THE WORD
A CONTINENT OF SELF-DIFFUSING PEACE
AN OCEAN OF UNTREMBLING VIRGIN FIRE
THE STRENGTH THE SILENCE OF THE GODS WERE HERS
IN HER HE FOUND A VASTNESS LIKE HIS OWN
HIS HIGH WARM SUBTLE ETHER HE REFOUND
AND MOVED IN HER AS IN HIS NATURAL HOME
IN HER HE MET HIS OWN ETERNITY
TILL THEN NO MOURNFUL LINE HAD BARRED THIS RAY
ON THE FRAIL BREAST OF THIS PRECARIOUS EARTH
SINCE HER ORBED SIGHT IN ITS BREATH-FASTENED HOUSE
OPENING IN SYMPATHY WITH HAPPIER STARS
WHERE LIFE IS NOT EXPOSED TO SORROWFUL CHANGE
REMEMBERED BEAUTY DEATH-CLAIMED LIDS IGNORE
AND WONDERED AT THIS WORLD OF FRAGILE FORMS
CARRIED ON CANVAS-STRIPS OF SHIMMERING TIME
THE IMPUNITY OF UNBORN MIGHTS WAS HERS
ALTHOUGH SHE LEANED TO BEAR THE HUMAN LOAD
HER WALK KEPT STILL THE MEASURES OF THE GODS
EARTH'S BREATH HAD FAILED TO STAIN THAT BRILLIANT GLASS
UNSMEARED WITH THE DUST OF OUR MORTAL ATMOSPHERE
IT STILL REFLECTED HEAVEN'S SPIRITUAL JOY
ALMOST THEY SAW WHO LIVED WITHIN HER LIGHT
HER PLAYMATE IN THE SEMPITERNAL SPHERES
DESCENDED FROM ITS UNATTAINABLE REALMS
IN HER ATTRACTING ADVENT'S LUMINOUS WAKE
THE WHITE-FIRE DRAGON-BIRD OF ENDLESS BLISS
DRIFTING WITH BURNING WINGS ABOVE HER DAYS
HEAVEN'S TRANQUIL SHIELD GUARDED THE MISSIONED CHILD
A GLOWING ORBIT WAS HER EARLY TERM
YEARS LIKE GOLD RAIMENT OF THE GODS THAT PASS
HER YOUTH SAT THRONED IN CALM FELICITY
BUT JOY CANNOT ENDURE UNTIL THE END
17
THERE IS A DARKNESS IN TERRESTRIAL THINGS
THAT WILL NOT SUFFER LONG TOO GLAD A NOTE
ON HER TOO CLOSED THE INESCAPABLE HAND
THE ARMED IMMORTAL BORE THE SNARE OF TIME
ONE DEALT WITH HER WHO MEETS THE BURDENED GREAT
ASSIGNER OF THE ORDEAL AND THE PATH
WHO CHOOSES IN THIS HOLOCAUST OF THE SOUL
DEATH FALL AND SORROW AS THE SPIRIT'S GOADS
THE DUBIOUS GODHEAD WITH HIS TORCH OF PAIN
LIT UP THE CHASM OF THE UNFINISHED WORLD
AND CALLED HER TO FILL WITH HER VAST SELF THE ABYSS
AUGUST AND PITILESS IN HIS CALM OUTLOOK
HEIGHTENING THE ETERNAL'S DREADFUL STRATEGY
HE MEASURED THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE MIGHT
AND DUG MORE DEEP THE GULF THAT ALL MUST CROSS
ASSAILING HER DIVINEST ELEMENTS
HE MADE HER HEART KIN TO THE STRIVING HUMAN HEART
AND FORCED HER STRENGTH TO ITS APPOINTED ROAD
FOR THIS SHE HAD ACCEPTED MORTAL BREATH
TO WRESTLE WITH THE SHADOW SHE HAD COME
AND MUST CONFRONT THE RIDDLE OF MAN'S BIRTH
AND LIFE'S BRIEF STRUGGLE IN DUMB MATTER'S NIGHT
WHETHER TO BEAR WITH IGNORANCE AND DEATH
OR HEW THE WAYS OF IMMORTALITY
TO WIN OR LOSE THE GODLIKE GAME FOR MAN
WAS HER SOUL'S ISSUE THROWN WITH DESTINY'S DICE
BUT NOT TO SUBMIT AND SUFFER WAS SHE BORN
TO LEAD TO DELIVER WAS HER GLORIOUS PART
HERE WAS NO FABRIC OF TERRESTRIAL MAKE
FIT FOR A DAY'S USE BY BUSY CARELESS POWERS
AN IMAGE FLUTTERING ON THE SCREEN OF FATE
HALF-ANIMATED FOR A PASSING SHOW
OR A CASTAWAY ON THE OCEAN OF DESIRE
FLUNG TO THE EDDIES IN A RUTHLESS SPORT
AND TOSSED ALONG THE GULFS OF CIRCUMSTANCE
A CREATURE BORN TO BEND BENEATH THE YOKE
18
A CHATTEL AND A PLAYTHING OF TIME'S LORDS
OR ONE MORE PAWN WHO COMES DESTINED TO BE PUSHED
ONE SLOW MOVE FORWARD ON A MEASURELESS BOARD
IN THE CHESS-PLAY OF THE EARTH-SOUL WITH DOOM
SUCH IS THE HUMAN FIGURE DRAWN BY TIME
A CONSCIOUS FRAME WAS HERE A SELF-BORN FORCE
IN THIS ENIGMA OF THE DUSK OF GOD
THIS SLOW AND STRANGE UNEASY COMPROMISE
OF LIMITING NATURE WITH A LIMITLESS SOUL
WHERE ALL MUST MOVE BETWEEN AN ORDERED CHANCE
AND AN UNCARING BLIND NECESSITY
TOO HIGH THE FIRE SPIRITUAL DARE NOT BLAZE
IF ONCE IT MET THE INTENSE ORIGINAL FLAME
AN ANSWERING TOUCH MIGHT SHATTER ALL MEASURES MADE
AND EARTH SINK DOWN WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE INFINITE
A GAOL IS THIS IMMENSE MATERIAL WORLD
ACROSS EACH ROAD STANDS ARMED A STONE-EYED LAW
AT EVERY GATE THE HUGE DIM SENTINELS PACE
A GREY TRIBUNAL OF THE IGNORANCE
AN INQUISITION OF THE PRIESTS OF NIGHT
IN JUDGMENT SIT ON THE ADVENTURER SOUL
AND THE DUAL TABLES AND THE KARMIC NORM
RESTRAIN THE TITAN IN US AND THE GOD
PAIN WITH ITS LASH JOY WITH ITS SILVER BRIBE
GUARD THE WHEEL'S CIRCLING IMMOBILITY
A BOND IS PUT ON THE HIGH-CLIMBING MIND
A SEAL ON THE TOO LARGE WIDE-OPEN HEART
DEATH STAYS THE JOURNEYING DISCOVERER LIFE
THUS IS THE THRONE OF THE INCONSCIENT SAFE
WHILE THE TARDY COILINGS OF THE AEONS PASS
AND THE ANIMAL BROWSES IN THE SACRED FENCE
AND THE GOLD HAWK CAN CROSS THE SKIES NO MORE
BUT ONE STOOD UP AND LIT THE LIMITLESS FLAME
ARRAIGNED BY THE DARK POWER THAT HATES ALL BLISS
IN THE DIRE COURT WHERE LIFE MUST PAY FOR JOY
SENTENCED BY THE MECHANIC JUSTICER
19
TO THE AFFLICTING PENALTY OF MAN'S HOPES
HER HEAD SHE BOWED NOT TO THE STARK DECREE
BARING HER HELPLESS HEART TO DESTINY'S STROKE
SO BOWS AND MUST THE MIND-BORN WILL IN MAN
OBEDIENT TO THE STATUTES FIXED OF OLD
ADMITTING WITHOUT APPEAL THE NETHER GODS
IN HER THE SUPERHUMAN CAST ITS SEED
INAPT TO FOLD ITS MIGHTY WINGS OF DREAM
HER SPIRIT REFUSED TO HUG THE COMMON SOIL
OR FINDING ALL LIFE'S GOLDEN MEANINGS ROBBED
COMPOUND WITH EARTH STRUCK FROM THE STARRY LIST
OR QUENCH WITH BLACK DESPAIR THE GOD-GIVEN LIGHT
ACCUSTOMED TO THE ETERNAL AND THE TRUE
HER BEING CONSCIOUS OF ITS DIVINE FOUNTS
ASKED NOT FROM MORTAL FRAILTY PAIN'S RELIEF
PATCHED NOT WITH FAILURE BARGAIN OR COMPROMISE
A WORK SHE HAD TO DO A WORD TO SPEAK
WRITING THE UNFINISHED STORY OF HER SOUL
IN THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS GRAVED IN NATURE'S BOOK
SHE ACCEPTED NOT TO CLOSE THE LUMINOUS PAGE
CANCEL HER COMMERCE WITH ETERNITY
OR SET A SIGNATURE OF WEAK ASSENT
TO THE BRUTE BALANCE OF THE WORLD'S EXCHANGE
A FORCE IN HER THAT TOILED SINCE EARTH WAS MADE
ACCOMPLISHING IN LIFE THE GREAT WORLD-PLAN
PURSUING AFTER DEATH IMMORTAL AIMS
REPUGNED TO ADMIT FRUSTRATION'S BARREN ROLE
FORFEIT THE MEANING OF HER BIRTH IN TIME
OBEY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CASUAL FACT
OR YIELD HER HIGH DESTINY UP TO PASSING CHANCE
IN HER OWN SELF SHE FOUND HER HIGH RECOURSE
SHE MATCHED WITH THE IRON LAW HER SOVEREIGN RIGHT
HER SINGLE WILL OPPOSED THE COSMIC RULE
TO STAY THE WHEELS OF DOOM THIS GREATNESS ROSE
AT THE UNSEEN'S KNOCK UPON HER HIDDEN GATES
HER STRENGTH MADE GREATER BY THE LIGHTNING'S TOUCH
20
AWOKE FROM SLUMBER IN HER HEART'S RECESS
IT BORE THE STROKE OF THAT WHICH KILLS AND SAVES
ACROSS THE AWFUL MARCH NO EYE CAN SEE
BARRING ITS DREADFUL ROUTE NO WILL CAN CHANGE
SHE FACED THE ENGINES OF THE UNIVERSE
A HEART STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE DRIVING WHEELS
ITS GIANT WORKINGS PAUSED IN FRONT OF A MIND
ITS STARK CONVENTIONS MET THE FLAME OF A SOUL
A MAGIC LEVERAGE SUDDENLY IS CAUGHT
THAT MOVES THE VEILED INEFFABLE'S TIMELESS WILL
A PRAYER A MASTER ACT A KING IDEA
CAN LINK MAN'S STRENGTH TO A TRANSCENDENT FORCE
THEN MIRACLE IS MADE THE COMMON RULE
ONE MIGHTY DEED CAN CHANGE THE COURSE OF THINGS
A LONELY THOUGHT BECOMES OMNIPOTENT
ALL NOW SEEMS NATURE'S MASSED MACHINERY
AN ENDLESS SERVITUDE TO MATERIAL RULE
AND LONG DETERMINATION'S RIGID CHAIN
HER FIRM AND CHANGELESS HABITS APING LAW
HER EMPIRE OF UNCONSCIOUS DEFT DEVICE
ANNUL THE CLAIM OF MAN'S FREE HUMAN WILL
HE TOO IS A MACHINE AMID MACHINES
A PISTON BRAIN PUMPS OUT THE SHAPES OF THOUGHT
A BEATING HEART CUTS OUT EMOTION'S MODES
AN INSENTIENT ENERGY FABRICATES A SOUL
OR THE FIGURE OF THE WORLD REVEALS THE SIGNS
OF A TIED CHANCE REPEATING HER OLD STEPS
IN CIRCLES AROUND MATTER'S BINDING-POSTS
A RANDOM SERIES OF INEPT EVENTS
TO WHICH REASON LENDS ILLUSIVE SENSE IS HERE
OR THE EMPIRIC LIFE'S INSTINCTIVE SEARCH
OR A VAST IGNORANT MIND'S COLOSSAL WORK
BUT WISDOM COMES AND VISION GROWS WITHIN
THEN NATURE'S INSTRUMENT CROWNS HIMSELF HER KING
HE FEELS HIS WITNESSING SELF AND CONSCIOUS POWER
HIS SOUL STEPS BACK AND SEES THE LIGHT SUPREME
21
A GODHEAD STANDS BEHIND THE BRUTE MACHINE
THIS TRUTH BROKE IN IN A TRIUMPH OF FIRE
A VICTORY WAS WON FOR GOD IN MAN
THE DEITY REVEALED ITS HIDDEN FACE
THE GREAT WORLD-MOTHER NOW IN HER AROSE
A LIVING CHOICE REVERSED FATE'S COLD DEAD TURN
AFFIRMED THE SPIRIT'S TREAD ON CIRCUMSTANCE
PRESSED BACK THE SENSELESS DIRE REVOLVING WHEEL
AND STOPPED THE MUTE MARCH OF NECESSITY
A FLAMING WARRIOR FROM THE ETERNAL PEAKS
EMPOWERED TO FORCE THE DOOR DENIED AND CLOSED
SMOTE FROM DEATH'S VISAGE ITS DUMB ABSOLUTE
AND BURST THE BOUNDS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND TIME
22
A WORLD'S DESIRE COMPELLED HER MORTAL BIRTH
ONE IN THE FRONT OF THE IMMEMORIAL QUEST
PROTAGONIST OF THE MYSTERIOUS PLAY
IN WHICH THE UNKNOWN PURSUES HIMSELF THROUGH FORMS
AND LIMITS HIS ETERNITY BY THE HOURS
AND THE BLIND VOID STRUGGLES TO LIVE AND SEE
A THINKER AND TOILER IN THE IDEAL'S AIR
BROUGHT DOWN TO EARTH'S DUMB NEED HER RADIANT POWER
HIS WAS A SPIRIT THAT STOOPED FROM LARGER SPHERES
INTO OUR PROVINCE OF EPHEMERAL SIGHT
A COLONIST FROM IMMORTALITY
A POINTING BEAM ON EARTH'S UNCERTAIN ROADS
HIS BIRTH HELD UP A SYMBOL AND A SIGN
HIS HUMAN SELF LIKE A TRANSLUCENT CLOAK
COVERED THE ALL-WISE WHO LEADS THE UNSEEING WORLD
AFFILIATED TO COSMIC SPACE AND TIME
AND PAYING HERE GOD'S DEBT TO EARTH AND MAN
A GREATER SONSHIP WAS HIS DIVINE RIGHT
ALTHOUGH CONSENTING TO MORTAL IGNORANCE
HIS KNOWLEDGE SHARED THE LIGHT INEFFABLE
A STRENGTH OF THE ORIGINAL PERMANENCE
ENTANGLED IN THE MOMENT AND ITS FLOW
HE KEPT THE VISION OF THE VASTS BEHIND
A POWER WAS IN HIM FROM THE UNKNOWABLE
AN ARCHIVIST OF THE SYMBOLS OF THE BEYOND
A TREASURER OF SUPERHUMAN DREAMS
HE BORE THE STAMP OF MIGHTY MEMORIES
AND SHED THEIR GRANDIOSE RAY ON HUMAN LIFE
HIS DAYS WERE A LONG GROWTH TO THE SUPREME
A SKYWARD BEING NOURISHING ITS ROOTS
23
ON SUSTENANCE FROM OCCULT SPIRITUAL FOUNTS
CLIMBED THROUGH WHITE RAYS TO MEET AN UNSEEN SUN
HIS SOUL LIVED AS ETERNITY'S DELEGATE
HIS MIND WAS LIKE A FIRE ASSAILING HEAVEN
HIS WILL A HUNTER IN THE TRAILS OF LIGHT
AN OCEAN IMPULSE LIFTED EVERY BREATH
EACH ACTION LEFT THE FOOTPRINTS OF A GOD
EACH MOMENT WAS A BEAT OF PUISSANT WINGS
THE LITTLE PLOT OF OUR MORTALITY
TOUCHED BY THIS TENANT FROM THE HEIGHTS BECAME
A PLAYGROUND OF THE LIVING INFINITE
THIS BODILY APPEARANCE IS NOT ALL
THE FORM DECEIVES THE PERSON IS A MASK
HID DEEP IN MAN CELESTIAL POWERS CAN DWELL
HIS FRAGILE SHIP CONVEYS THROUGH THE SEA OF YEARS
AN INCOGNITO OF THE IMPERISHABLE
A SPIRIT THAT IS A FLAME OF GOD ABIDES
A FIERY PORTION OF THE WONDERFUL
ARTIST OF HIS OWN BEAUTY AND DELIGHT
IMMORTAL IN OUR MORTAL POVERTY
THIS SCULPTOR OF THE FORMS OF THE INFINITE
THIS SCREENED UNRECOGNISED INHABITANT
INITIATE OF HIS OWN VEILED MYSTERIES
HIDES IN A SMALL DUMB SEED HIS COSMIC THOUGHT
IN THE MUTE STRENGTH OF THE OCCULT IDEA
DETERMINING PREDESTINED SHAPE AND ACT
PASSENGER FROM LIFE TO LIFE FROM SCALE TO SCALE
CHANGING HIS IMAGED SELF FROM FORM TO FORM
HE REGARDS THE ICON GROWING BY HIS GAZE
AND IN THE WORM FORESEES THE COMING GOD
AT LAST THE TRAVELLER IN THE PATHS OF TIME
ARRIVES ON THE FRONTIERS OF ETERNITY
IN THE TRANSIENT SYMBOL OF HUMANITY DRAPED
HE FEELS HIS SUBSTANCE OF UNDYING SELF
AND LOSES HIS KINSHIP TO MORTALITY
A BEAM OF THE ETERNAL SMITES HIS HEART
24
HIS THOUGHT STRETCHES INTO INFINITUDE
ALL IN HIM TURNS TO SPIRIT VASTNESSES
HIS SOUL BREAKS OUT TO JOIN THE OVERSOUL
HIS LIFE IS OCEANED BY THAT SUPERLIFE
HE HAS DRUNK FROM THE BREASTS OF THE MOTHER OF THE WORLDS
A TOPLESS SUPERNATURE FILLS HIS FRAME
SHE ADOPTS HIS SPIRIT'S EVERLASTING GROUND
AS THE SECURITY OF HER CHANGING WORLD
AND SHAPES THE FIGURE OF HER UNBORN MIGHTS
IMMORTALLY SHE CONCEIVES HERSELF IN HIM
IN THE CREATURE THE UNVEILED CREATRIX WORKS
HER FACE IS SEEN THROUGH HIS FACE HER EYES THROUGH HIS EYES
HER BEING IS HIS THROUGH A VAST IDENTITY
THEN IS REVEALED IN MAN THE OVERT DIVINE
A STATIC ONENESS AND DYNAMIC POWER
DESCEND IN HIM THE INTEGRAL GODHEAD'S SEALS
HIS SOUL AND BODY TAKE THAT SPLENDID STAMP
A LONG DIM PREPARATION IS MAN'S LIFE
A CIRCLE OF TOIL AND HOPE AND WAR AND PEACE
TRACKED OUT BY LIFE ON MATTER'S OBSCURE GROUND
IN HIS CLIMB TO A PEAK NO FEET HAVE EVER TROD
HE SEEKS THROUGH A PENUMBRA SHOT WITH FLAME
A VEILED REALITY HALF-KNOWN EVER MISSED
A SEARCH FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEONE NEVER FOUND
CULT OF AN IDEAL NEVER MADE REAL HERE
AN ENDLESS SPIRAL OF ASCENT AND FALL
UNTIL AT LAST IS REACHED THE GIANT POINT
THROUGH WHICH HIS GLORY SHINES FOR WHOM WE WERE MADE
AND WE BREAK INTO THE INFINITY OF GOD
ACROSS OUR NATURE'S BORDER LINE WE ESCAPE
INTO SUPERNATURE'S ARC OF LIVING LIGHT
THIS NOW WAS WITNESSED IN THAT SON OF FORCE
IN HIM THAT HIGH TRANSITION LAID ITS BASE
ORIGINAL AND SUPERNAL IMMANENCE
OF WHICH ALL NATURE'S PROCESS IS THE ART
THE COSMIC WORKER SET HIS SECRET HAND
25
TO TURN THIS FRAIL MUD-ENGINE TO HEAVEN-USE
A PRESENCE WROUGHT BEHIND THE AMBIGUOUS SCREEN
IT BEAT HIS SOIL TO BEAR A TITAN'S WEIGHT
REFINING HALF-HEWN BLOCKS OF NATURAL STRENGTH
IT BUILT HIS SOUL INTO A STATUED GOD
THE CRAFTSMAN OF THE MAGIC STUFF OF SELF
WHO LABOURS AT HIS HIGH AND DIFFICULT PLAN
IN THE WIDE WORKSHOP OF THE WONDERFUL WORLD
MODELLED IN INWARD TIME HIS RHYTHMIC PARTS
THEN CAME THE ABRUPT TRANSCENDENT MIRACLE
THE MASKED IMMACULATE GRANDEUR COULD OUTLINE
AT TRAVAIL IN THE OCCULT WOMB OF LIFE
HIS DREAMED MAGNIFICENCE OF THINGS TO BE
A CROWN OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE WORLDS
A MYSTERY OF MARRIED EARTH AND HEAVEN
ANNEXED DIVINITY TO THE MORTAL SCHEME
A SEER WAS BORN A SHINING GUEST OF TIME
FOR HIM MIND'S LIMITING FIRMAMENT CEASED ABOVE
IN THE GRIFFIN FOREFRONT OF THE NIGHT AND DAY
A GAP WAS RENT IN THE ALL-CONCEALING VAULT
THE CONSCIOUS ENDS OF BEING WENT ROLLING BACK
THE LANDMARKS OF THE LITTLE PERSON FELL
THE ISLAND EGO JOINED ITS CONTINENT
OVERPASSED WAS THIS WORLD OF RIGID LIMITING FORMS
LIFE'S BARRIERS OPENED INTO THE UNKNOWN
ABOLISHED WERE CONCEPTION'S COVENANTS
AND STRIKING OFF SUBJECTION'S RIGOROUS CLAUSE
ANNULLED THE SOUL'S TREATY WITH NATURE'S NESCIENCE
ALL THE GREY INHIBITIONS WERE TORN OFF
AND BROKEN THE INTELLECT'S HARD AND LUSTROUS LID
TRUTH UNPARTITIONED FOUND IMMENSE SKY-ROOM
AN EMPYREAN VISION SAW AND KNEW
THE BOUNDED MIND BECAME A BOUNDLESS LIGHT
THE FINITE SELF MATED WITH INFINITY
HIS MARCH NOW SOARED INTO AN EAGLE'S FLIGHT
OUT OF APPRENTICESHIP TO IGNORANCE
26
WISDOM UPRAISED HIM TO HER MASTER CRAFT
AND MADE HIM AN ARCHMASON OF THE SOUL
A BUILDER OF THE IMMORTAL'S SECRET HOUSE
AN ASPIRANT TO SUPERNAL TIMELESSNESS
FREEDOM AND EMPIRE CALLED TO HIM FROM ON HIGH
ABOVE MIND'S TWILIGHT AND LIFE'S STAR-LED NIGHT
THERE GLEAMED THE DAWN OF A SPIRITUAL DAY
AS SO HE GREW INTO HIS LARGER SELF
HUMANITY FRAMED HIS MOVEMENTS LESS AND LESS
A GREATER BEING SAW A GREATER WORLD
A FEARLESS WILL FOR KNOWLEDGE DARED TO ERASE
THE LINES OF SAFETY REASON DRAWS THAT BAR
MIND'S SOAR SOUL'S DIVE INTO THE INFINITE
EVEN HIS FIRST STEPS BROKE OUR SMALL EARTH-BOUNDS
AND LOITERED IN A VASTER FREER AIR
IN HANDS SUSTAINED BY A TRANSFIGURING MIGHT
HE CAUGHT UP LIGHTLY LIKE A GIANT'S BOW
LEFT SLUMBERING IN A SEALED AND SECRET CAVE
THE POWERS THAT SLEEP UNUSED IN MAN WITHIN
HE MADE OF MIRACLE A NORMAL ACT
AND TURNED TO A COMMON PART OF DIVINE WORKS
MAGNIFICENTLY NATURAL AT THIS HEIGHT
EFFORTS THAT WOULD SHATTER THE STRENGTH OF MORTAL HEARTS
PURSUED IN A ROYALTY OF MIGHTY EASE
AIMS TOO SUBLIME FOR NATURE'S DAILY WILL
THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT CROWDING CAME TO HIM
THEY WERE HIS LIFE'S PATTERN AND HIS PRIVILEGE
A PURE PERCEPTION LENT ITS LUCENT JOY
ITS INTIMATE VISION WAITED NOT TO THINK
IT ENVELOPED ALL NATURE IN A SINGLE GLANCE
IT LOOKED INTO THE VERY SELF OF THINGS
DECEIVED NO MORE BY FORM HE SAW THE SOUL
IN BEINGS IT KNEW WHAT LURKED TO THEM UNKNOWN
IT SEIZED THE IDEA IN MIND THE WISH IN THE HEART
IT PLUCKED OUT FROM GREY FOLDS OF SECRECY
27
THE MOTIVES WHICH FROM THEIR OWN SIGHT MEN HIDE
HE FELT THE BEATING LIFE IN OTHER MEN
INVADE HIM WITH THEIR HAPPINESS AND THEIR GRIEF
THEIR LOVE THEIR ANGER THEIR UNSPOKEN HOPES
ENTERED IN CURRENTS OR IN POURING WAVES
INTO THE IMMOBILE OCEAN OF HIS CALM
HE HEARD THE INSPIRED SOUND OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS
RE-ECHOED IN THE VAULT OF OTHER MINDS
THE WORLD'S THOUGHT-STREAMS TRAVELLED INTO HIS KEN
HIS INNER SELF GREW NEAR TO OTHERS' SELVES
AND BORE A KINSHIP'S WEIGHT A COMMON TIE
YET STOOD UNTOUCHED KING OF ITSELF ALONE
A MAGICAL ACCORD QUICKENED AND ATTUNED
TO ETHEREAL SYMPHONIES THE OLD EARTHY STRINGS
IT RAISED THE SERVITORS OF MIND AND LIFE
TO BE HAPPY PARTNERS IN THE SOUL'S RESPONSE
TISSUE AND NERVE WERE TURNED TO SENSITIVE CHORDS
RECORDS OF LUSTRE AND ECSTASY IT MADE
THE BODY'S MEANS THE SPIRIT'S ACOLYTES
A HEAVENLIER FUNCTION WITH A FINER MODE
LIT WITH ITS GRACE MAN'S OUTWARD EARTHLINESS
THE SOUL'S EXPERIENCE OF ITS DEEPER SHEATHS
NO MORE SLEPT DRUGGED BY MATTER'S DOMINANCE
IN THE DEAD WALL CLOSING US FROM WIDER SELF
INTO A SECRECY OF APPARENT SLEEP
THE MYSTIC TRACT BEYOND OUR WAKING THOUGHTS
A DOOR PARTED BUILT IN BY MATTER'S FORCE
RELEASING THINGS UNSEIZED BY EARTHLY SENSE
A WORLD UNSEEN UNKNOWN BY OUTWARD MIND
APPEARED IN THE SILENT SPACES OF THE SOUL
HE SAT IN SECRET CHAMBERS LOOKING OUT
INTO THE LUMINOUS COUNTRIES OF THE UNBORN
WHERE ALL THINGS DREAMED BY THE MIND ARE SEEN AND TRUE
AND ALL THAT THE LIFE LONGS FOR IS DRAWN CLOSE
HE SAW THE PERFECT IN THEIR STARRY HOMES
WEARING THE GLORY OF A DEATHLESS FORM
28
LAIN IN THE ARMS OF THE ETERNAL'S PEACE
RAPT IN THE HEART-BEATS OF GOD-ECSTASY
HE LIVED IN THE MYSTIC SPACE WHERE THOUGHT IS BORN
AND WILL IS NURSED BY AN ETHEREAL POWER
AND FED ON THE WHITE MILK OF THE ETERNAL'S STRENGTHS
TILL IT GROWS INTO THE LIKENESS OF A GOD
IN THE WITNESS'S OCCULT ROOMS WITH MIND-BUILT WALLS
ON HIDDEN INTERIORS LURKING PASSAGES
OPENED THE WINDOWS OF THE INNER SIGHT
HE OWNED THE HOUSE OF UNDIVIDED TIME
LIFTING THE HEAVY CURTAIN OF THE FLESH
HE STOOD UPON A THRESHOLD SERPENT-WATCHED
AND PEERED INTO GLEAMING ENDLESS CORRIDORS
SILENT AND LISTENING IN THE SILENT HEART
FOR THE COMING OF THE NEW AND THE UNKNOWN
HE GAZED ACROSS THE EMPTY STILLNESSES
AND HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE UNDREAMED IDEA
IN THE FAR AVENUES OF THE BEYOND
HE HEARD THE SECRET VOICE THE WORD THAT KNOWS
AND SAW THE SECRET FACE THAT IS OUR OWN
THE INNER PLANES UNCOVERED THEIR CRYSTAL DOORS
STRANGE POWERS AND INFLUENCES TOUCHED HIS LIFE
A VISION CAME OF HIGHER REALMS THAN OURS
A CONSCIOUSNESS OF BRIGHTER FIELDS AND SKIES
OF BEINGS LESS CIRCUMSCRIBED THAN BRIEF-LIVED MEN
AND SUBTLER BODIES THAN THESE PASSING FRAMES
OBJECTS TOO FINE FOR OUR MATERIAL GRASP
ACTS VIBRANT WITH A SUPERHUMAN LIGHT
AND MOVEMENTS PUSHED BY A SUPERCONSCIENT FORCE
AND JOYS THAT NEVER FLOWED THROUGH MORTAL LIMBS
AND LOVELIER SCENES THAN EARTH'S AND HAPPIER LIVES
A CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEAUTY AND OF BLISS
A KNOWLEDGE WHICH BECAME WHAT IT PERCEIVED
REPLACED THE SEPARATED SENSE AND HEART
AND DREW ALL NATURE INTO ITS EMBRACE
THE MIND LEANED OUT TO MEET THE HIDDEN WORLDS
29
AIR GLOWED AND TEEMED WITH MARVELLOUS SHAPES AND HUES
IN THE NOSTRILS QUIVERED CELESTIAL FRAGRANCES
ON THE TONGUE LINGERED THE HONEY OF PARADISE
A CHANNEL OF UNIVERSAL HARMONY
HEARING WAS A STREAM OF MAGIC AUDIENCE
A BED FOR OCCULT SOUNDS EARTH CANNOT HEAR
OUT OF A COVERT TRACT OF SLUMBER SELF
THE VOICE CAME OF A TRUTH SUBMERGED UNKNOWN
THAT FLOWS BENEATH THE COSMIC SURFACES
ONLY MID AN OMNISCIENT SILENCE HEARD
HELD BY INTUITIVE HEART AND SECRET SENSE
IT CAUGHT THE BURDEN OF SECRECIES SEALED AND DUMB
IT VOICED THE UNFULFILLED DEMAND OF EARTH
AND THE SONG OF PROMISE OF UNREALISED HEAVENS
AND ALL THAT HIDES IN AN OMNIPOTENT SLEEP
IN THE UNCEASING DRAMA CARRIED BY TIME
ON ITS LONG LISTENING FLOOD THAT BEARS THE WORLD'S
INSOLUBLE DOUBT ON A PILGRIMAGE WITHOUT GOAL
A LAUGHTER OF SLEEPLESS PLEASURE FOAMED AND SPUMED
AND MURMURINGS OF DESIRE THAT CANNOT DIE
A CRY CAME OF THE WORLD'S DELIGHT TO BE
THE GRANDEUR AND GREATNESS OF ITS WILL TO LIVE
RECALL OF THE SOUL'S ADVENTURE INTO SPACE
A TRAVELLER THROUGH THE MAGIC CENTURIES
AND BEING'S LABOUR IN MATTER'S UNIVERSE
ITS SEARCH FOR THE MYSTIC MEANING OF ITS BIRTH
AND JOY OF HIGH SPIRITUAL RESPONSE
ITS THROB OF SATISFACTION AND CONTENT
IN ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE GIFTS OF LIFE
ITS LARGE BREATH AND PULSE AND THRILL OF HOPE AND FEAR
ITS TASTE OF PANGS AND TEARS AND ECSTASY
ITS RAPTURE'S POIGNANT BEAT OF SUDDEN BLISS
THE SOB OF ITS PASSION AND UNENDING PAIN
THE MURMUR AND WHISPER OF THE UNHEARD SOUNDS
WHICH CROWD AROUND OUR HEARTS BUT FIND NO WINDOW
TO ENTER SWELLED INTO A CANTICLE
30
OF ALL THAT SUFFERS TO BE STILL UNKNOWN
AND ALL THAT LABOURS VAINLY TO BE BORN
AND ALL THE SWEETNESS NONE WILL EVER TASTE
AND ALL THE BEAUTY THAT WILL NEVER BE
INAUDIBLE TO OUR DEAF MORTAL EARS
THE WIDE WORLD-RHYTHMS WOVE THEIR STUPENDOUS CHANT
TO WHICH LIFE STRIVES TO FIT OUR RHYME-BEATS HERE
MELTING OUR LIMITS IN THE ILLIMITABLE
TUNING THE FINITE TO INFINITY
A LOW MUTTERING ROSE FROM THE SUBCONSCIENT CAVES
THE STAMMER OF THE PRIMAL IGNORANCE
ANSWER TO THAT INARTICULATE QUESTIONING
THERE STOOPED WITH LIGHTNING NECK AND THUNDER'S WINGS
A RADIANT HYMN TO THE INEXPRESSIBLE
AND THE ANTHEM OF THE SUPERCONSCIENT LIGHT
ALL WAS REVEALED THERE NONE CAN HERE EXPRESS
VISION AND DREAM WERE FABLES SPOKEN BY TRUTH
OR SYMBOLS MORE VERIDICAL THAN FACT
OR WERE TRUTHS ENFORCED BY SUPERNATURAL SEALS
IMMORTAL EYES APPROACHED AND LOOKED IN HIS
AND BEINGS OF MANY KINGDOMS NEARED AND SPOKE
THE EVER-LIVING WHOM WE NAME AS DEAD
COULD LEAVE THEIR GLORY BEYOND DEATH AND BIRTH
TO UTTER THE WISDOM WHICH EXCEEDS ALL PHRASE
THE KINGS OF EVIL AND THE KINGS OF GOOD
APPELLANTS AT THE REASON'S JUDGMENT SEAT
PROCLAIMED THE GOSPEL OF THEIR OPPOSITES
AND ALL BELIEVED THEMSELVES SPOKESMEN OF GOD
THE GODS OF LIGHT AND TITANS OF THE DARK
BATTLED FOR HIS SOUL AS FOR A COSTLY PRIZE
IN EVERY HOUR LOOSED FROM THE QUIVER OF TIME
THERE ROSE A SONG OF NEW DISCOVERY
A BOW-TWANG'S HUM OF YOUNG EXPERIMENT
EACH DAY WAS A SPIRITUAL ROMANCE
AS IF HE WAS BORN INTO A BRIGHT NEW WORLD
ADVENTURE LEAPED AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND
31
AND DANGER BROUGHT A KEEN SWEET TANG OF JOY
EACH HAPPENING WAS A DEEP EXPERIENCE
THERE WERE HIGH ENCOUNTERS EPIC COLLOQUIES
AND COUNSELS CAME COUCHED IN CELESTIAL SPEECH
AND HONEYED PLEADINGS BREATHED FROM OCCULT LIPS
TO HELP THE HEART TO YIELD TO RAPTURE'S CALL
AND SWEET TEMPTATIONS STOLE FROM BEAUTY'S REALMS
AND SUDDEN ECSTASIES FROM A WORLD OF BLISS
IT WAS A REGION OF WONDER AND DELIGHT
ALL NOW HIS BRIGHT CLAIRAUDIENCE COULD RECEIVE
A CONTACT THRILLED OF MIGHTY UNKNOWN THINGS
AWAKENED TO NEW UNEARTHLY CLOSENESSES
THE TOUCH REPLIED TO SUBTLE INFINITIES
AND WITH A SILVER CRY OF OPENING GATES
SIGHT'S LIGHTNINGS LEAPED INTO THE INVISIBLE
EVER HIS CONSCIOUSNESS AND VISION GREW
THEY TOOK AN AMPLER SWEEP A LOFTIER FLIGHT
HE PASSED THE BORDER MARKED FOR MATTER'S RULE
AND PASSED THE ZONE WHERE THOUGHT REPLACES LIFE
OUT OF THIS WORLD OF SIGNS SUDDENLY HE CAME
INTO A SILENT SELF WHERE WORLD WAS NOT
AND LOOKED BEYOND INTO A NAMELESS VAST
THESE SYMBOL FIGURES LOST THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE
ALL TOKENS DROPPED OUR SENSE CAN RECOGNISE
THERE THE HEART BEAT NO MORE AT BODY'S TOUCH
THERE THE EYES GAZED NO MORE ON BEAUTY'S SHAPE
IN RARE AND LUCENT INTERVALS OF HUSH
INTO A SIGNLESS REGION HE COULD SOAR
PACKED WITH THE DEEP CONTENTS OF FORMLESSNESS
WHERE WORLD WAS INTO A SINGLE BEING RAPT
AND ALL WAS KNOWN BY THE LIGHT OF IDENTITY
AND SPIRIT WAS ITS OWN SELF-EVIDENCE
THE SUPREME'S GAZE LOOKED OUT THROUGH HUMAN EYES
AND SAW ALL THINGS AND CREATURES AS ITSELF
AND KNEW ALL THOUGHT AND WORD AS ITS OWN VOICE
THERE UNITY IS TOO CLOSE FOR SEARCH AND CLASP
32
AND LOVE IS A YEARNING OF THE ONE FOR THE ONE
AND BEAUTY IS A SWEET DIFFERENCE OF THE SAME
AND ONENESS IS THE SOUL OF MULTITUDE
THERE ALL THE TRUTHS UNITE IN A SINGLE TRUTH
AND ALL IDEAS REJOIN REALITY
THERE KNOWING HERSELF BY HER OWN TERMLESS SELF
WISDOM SUPERNAL WORDLESS ABSOLUTE
SAT UNCOMPANIONED IN THE ETERNAL CALM
ALL-SEEING MOTIONLESS SOVEREIGN AND ALONE
THERE KNOWLEDGE NEEDS NOT WORDS TO EMBODY IDEA
IDEA SEEKING A HOUSE IN BOUNDLESSNESS
WEARY OF ITS HOMELESS IMMORTALITY
ASKS NOT IN THOUGHT'S CARVED BRILLIANT CELL TO REST
WHOSE SINGLE WINDOW'S CLIPPED OUTLOOK ON THINGS
SEES ONLY A LITTLE ARC OF GOD'S VAST SKY
THE BOUNDLESS WITH THE BOUNDLESS THERE CONSORTS
WHILE THERE ONE CAN BE WIDER THAN THE WORLD
WHILE THERE ONE IS ONE'S OWN INFINITY
HIS CENTRE WAS NO MORE IN EARTHLY MIND
A POWER OF SEEING SILENCE FILLED HIS LIMBS
CAUGHT BY A VOICELESS WHITE EPIPHANY
INTO A VISION THAT SURPASSES FORMS
INTO A LIVING THAT SURPASSES LIFE
HE NEARED THE STILL CONSCIOUSNESS SUSTAINING ALL
THE VOICE THAT ONLY BY SPEECH CAN MOVE THE MIND
BECAME A SILENT KNOWLEDGE IN THE SOUL
THE STRENGTH THAT ONLY IN ACTION FEELS ITS TRUTH
WAS LODGED NOW IN A MUTE OMNIPOTENT PEACE
A LEISURE IN THE LABOUR OF THE WORLDS
A PAUSE IN THE JOY AND ANGUISH OF THE SEARCH
RESTORED THE STRESS OF NATURE TO GOD'S CALM
A VAST UNANIMITY ENDED LIFE'S DEBATE
THE WAR OF THOUGHTS THAT FATHERS THE UNIVERSE
THE CLASH OF FORCES STRUGGLING TO PREVAIL
IN THE TREMENDOUS SHOCK THAT LIGHTS A STAR
AS IN THE BUILDING OF A GRAIN OF DUST
33
THE GROOVES THAT TURN THEIR DUMB ELLIPSE IN SPACE
PLOUGHED BY THE SEEKING OF THE WORLD'S DESIRE
THE LONG REGURGITATIONS OF TIME'S FLOOD
THE TORMENT EDGING THE DIRE FORCE OF LUST
THAT WAKES KINETIC IN EARTH'S DULLARD SLIME
AND CARVES A PERSONALITY OUT OF MUD
THE SORROW BY WHICH NATURE'S HUNGER IS FED
THE OESTRUS WHICH CREATES WITH FIRE OF PAIN
THE FATE THAT PUNISHES VIRTUE WITH DEFEAT
THE TRAGEDY THAT DESTROYS LONG HAPPINESS
THE WEEPING OF LOVE THE QUARREL OF THE GODS
CEASED IN A TRUTH WHICH LIVES IN ITS OWN LIGHT
HIS SOUL STOOD FREE A WITNESS AND A KING
ABSORBED NO MORE IN THE MOMENT-RIDDEN FLUX
WHERE MIND INCESSANTLY DRIFTS AS ON A RAFT
HURRIED FROM PHENOMENON TO PHENOMENON
HE ABODE AT REST IN INDIVISIBLE TIME
AS IF A STORY LONG WRITTEN BUT ACTED NOW
IN HIS PRESENT HE HELD HIS FUTURE AND HIS PAST
FELT IN THE SECONDS THE UNCOUNTED YEARS
AND SAW THE HOURS LIKE DOTS UPON A PAGE
AN ASPECT OF THE UNKNOWN REALITY
ALTERED THE MEANING OF THE COSMIC SCENE
THIS HUGE MATERIAL UNIVERSE BECAME
A SMALL RESULT OF A STUPENDOUS FORCE
OVERTAKING THE MOMENT THE ETERNAL RAY
ILLUMINED THAT WHICH NEVER YET WAS MADE
THOUGHT LAY DOWN IN A MIGHTY VOICELESSNESS
THE TOILING THINKER WIDENED AND GREW STILL
WISDOM TRANSCENDENT TOUCHED HIS QUIVERING HEART
HIS SOUL COULD SAIL BEYOND THOUGHT'S LUMINOUS BAR
MIND SCREENED NO MORE THE SHORELESS INFINITE
ACROSS A VOID RETREATING SKY HE GLIMPSED
THROUGH A LAST GLIMMER AND DRIFT OF VANISHING STARS
THE SUPERCONSCIENT REALMS OF MOTIONLESS PEACE
WHERE JUDGMENT CEASES AND THE WORD IS MUTE
34
AND THE UNCONCEIVED LIES PATHLESS AND ALONE
THERE CAME NOT FORM OR ANY MOUNTING VOICE
THERE ONLY WERE SILENCE AND THE ABSOLUTE
OUT OF THAT STILLNESS MIND NEW-BORN AROSE
AND WOKE TO TRUTHS ONCE INEXPRESSIBLE
AND FORMS APPEARED DUMBLY SIGNIFICANT
A SEEING THOUGHT A SELF-REVEALING VOICE
HE KNEW THE SOURCE FROM WHICH HIS SPIRIT CAME
MOVEMENT WAS MARRIED TO THE IMMOBILE VAST
HE PLUNGED HIS ROOTS INTO THE INFINITE
HE BASED HIS LIFE UPON ETERNITY
ONLY AWHILE AT FIRST THESE HEAVENLIER STATES
THESE LARGE WIDE-POISED UPLIFTINGS COULD ENDURE
THE HIGH AND LUMINOUS TENSION BREAKS TOO SOON
THE BODY'S STONE STILLNESS AND THE LIFE'S HUSHED TRANCE
THE BREATHLESS MIGHT AND CALM OF SILENT MIND
OR SLOWLY THEY FAIL AS SETS A GOLDEN DAY
THE RESTLESS NETHER MEMBERS TIRE OF PEACE
A NOSTALGIA OF OLD LITTLE WORKS AND JOYS
A NEED TO CALL BACK SMALL FAMILIAR SELVES
TO TREAD THE ACCUSTOMED AND INFERIOR WAY
THE NEED TO REST IN A NATURAL POSE OF FALL
AS A CHILD WHO LEARNS TO WALK CAN WALK NOT LONG
REPLACE THE TITAN WILL FOR EVER TO CLIMB
ON THE HEART'S ALTAR DIM THE SACRED FIRE
AN OLD PULL OF SUBCONSCIOUS CORDS RENEWS
IT DRAWS THE UNWILLING SPIRIT FROM THE HEIGHTS
OR A DULL GRAVITATION DRAGS US DOWN
TO THE BLIND DRIVEN INERTIA OF OUR BASE
THIS TOO THE SUPREME DIPLOMAT CAN USE
HE MAKES OUR FALL A MEANS FOR GREATER RISE
FOR INTO IGNORANT NATURE'S GUSTY FIELD
INTO THE HALF-ORDERED CHAOS OF MORTAL LIFE
THE FORMLESS POWER THE SELF OF ETERNAL LIGHT
FOLLOW IN THE SHADOW OF THE SPIRIT'S DESCENT
35
THE TWIN DUALITY FOR EVER ONE
CHOOSES ITS HOME MID THE TUMULTS OF THE SENSE
HE COMES UNSEEN INTO OUR DARKER PARTS
AND CURTAINED BY THE DARKNESS DOES HIS WORK
A SUBTLE AND ALL-KNOWING GUEST AND GUIDE
TILL THEY TOO FEEL THE NEED AND WILL TO CHANGE
ALL HERE MUST LEARN TO OBEY A HIGHER LAW
OUR BODY'S CELLS MUST HOLD THE IMMORTAL'S FLAME
ELSE WOULD THE SPIRIT REACH ALONE ITS SOURCE
LEAVING A HALF-SAVED WORLD TO ITS DUBIOUS FATE
NATURE WOULD EVER LABOUR UNREDEEMED
OUR EARTH WOULD EVER SPIN UNHELPED IN SPACE
AND THIS IMMENSE CREATION'S PURPOSE FAIL
TILL AT LAST THE FRUSTRATE UNIVERSE SANK UNDONE
EVEN HIS GODLIKE STRENGTH TO RISE MUST FALL
HIS GREATER CONSCIOUSNESS WITHDREW BEHIND
DIM AND ECLIPSED HIS HUMAN OUTSIDE STROVE
TO FEEL AGAIN THE OLD SUBLIMITIES
BRING THE HIGH SAVING TOUCH THE ETHEREAL FLAME
CALL BACK TO ITS DIRE NEED THE DIVINE FORCE
ALWAYS THE POWER POURED BACK LIKE SUDDEN RAIN
OR SLOWLY IN HIS BREAST A PRESENCE GREW
IT CLAMBERED BACK TO SOME REMEMBERED HEIGHT
OR SOARED ABOVE THE PEAK FROM WHICH IT FELL
EACH TIME HE ROSE THERE WAS A LARGER POISE
A DWELLING ON A HIGHER SPIRIT PLANE
THE LIGHT REMAINED IN HIM A LONGER SPACE
IN THIS OSCILLATION BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN
IN THIS INEFFABLE COMMUNION'S CLIMB
THERE GREW IN HIM AS GROWS A WAXING MOON
THE GLORY OF THE INTEGER OF HIS SOUL
A UNION OF THE REAL WITH THE UNIQUE
A GAZE OF THE ALONE FROM EVERY FACE
THE PRESENCE OF THE ETERNAL IN THE HOURS
WIDENING THE MORTAL MIND'S HALF-LOOK ON THINGS
BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN MAN'S FORCE AND FATE
36
MADE WHOLE THE FRAGMENT-BEING WE ARE HERE
AT LAST WAS WON A FIRM SPIRITUAL POISE
A CONSTANT LODGING IN THE ETERNAL'S REALM
A SAFETY IN THE SILENCE AND THE RAY
A SETTLEMENT IN THE IMMUTABLE
HIS HEIGHTS OF BEING LIVED IN THE STILL SELF
HIS MIND COULD REST ON A SUPERNAL GROUND
AND LOOK DOWN ON THE MAGIC AND THE PLAY
WHERE THE GOD-CHILD LIES ON THE LAP OF NIGHT AND DAWN
AND THE EVERLASTING PUTS ON TIME'S DISGUISE
TO THE STILL HEIGHTS AND TO THE TROUBLED DEPTHS
HIS EQUAL SPIRIT GAVE ITS VAST ASSENT
A POISED SERENITY OF TRANQUIL STRENGTH
A WIDE UNSHAKEN LOOK ON TIME'S UNREST
FACED ALL EXPERIENCE WITH UNALTERED PEACE
INDIFFERENT TO THE SORROW AND DELIGHT
UNTEMPTED BY THE MARVEL AND THE CALL
IMMOBILE IT BEHELD THE FLUX OF THINGS
CALM AND APART SUPPORTED ALL THAT IS
HIS SPIRIT'S STILLNESS HELPED THE TOILING WORLD
INSPIRED BY SILENCE AND THE CLOSED EYES' SIGHT
HIS FORCE COULD WORK WITH A NEW LUMINOUS ART
ON THE CRUDE MATERIAL FROM WHICH ALL IS MADE
AND THE REFUSAL OF INERTIA'S MASS
AND THE GREY FRONT OF THE WORLD'S IGNORANCE
AND NESCIENT MATTER AND THE HUGE ERROR OF LIFE
AS A SCULPTOR CHISELS A DEITY OUT OF STONE
HE SLOWLY CHIPPED OFF THE DARK ENVELOPE
LINE OF DEFENCE OF NATURE'S IGNORANCE
THE ILLUSION AND MYSTERY OF THE INCONSCIENT
IN WHOSE BLACK PALL THE ETERNAL WRAPS HIS HEAD
THAT HE MAY ACT UNKNOWN IN COSMIC TIME
A SPLENDOUR OF SELF-CREATION FROM THE PEAKS
A TRANSFIGURATION IN THE MYSTIC DEPTHS
A HAPPIER COSMIC WORKING COULD BEGIN
AND FASHION THE WORLD-SHAPE IN HIM ANEW
37
GOD FOUND IN NATURE NATURE FULFILLED IN GOD
ALREADY IN HIM WAS SEEN THAT TASK OF POWER
LIFE MADE ITS HOME ON THE HIGH TOPS OF SELF
HIS SOUL MIND HEART BECAME A SINGLE SUN
ONLY LIFE'S LOWER REACHES REMAINED DIM
BUT THERE TOO IN THE UNCERTAIN SHADOW OF LIFE
THERE WAS A LABOUR AND A FIERY BREATH
THE AMBIGUOUS COWLED CELESTIAL PUISSANCE WORKED
WATCHED BY THE INNER WITNESS'S MOVELESS PEACE
EVEN ON THE STRUGGLING NATURE LEFT BELOW
STRONG PERIODS OF ILLUMINATION CAME
LIGHTNINGS OF GLORY AFTER GLORY BURNED
EXPERIENCE WAS A TALE OF BLAZE AND FIRE
AIR RIPPLED ROUND THE ARGOSIES OF THE GODS
STRANGE RICHES SAILED TO HIM FROM THE UNSEEN
SPLENDOURS OF INSIGHT FILLED THE BLANK OF THOUGHT
KNOWLEDGE SPOKE TO THE INCONSCIENT STILLNESSES
RIVERS POURED DOWN OF BLISS AND LUMINOUS FORCE
VISITS OF BEAUTY STORM-SWEEPS OF DELIGHT
RAINED FROM THE ALL-POWERFUL MYSTERY ABOVE
THENCE STOOPED THE EAGLES OF OMNISCIENCE
A DENSE VEIL WAS RENT A MIGHTY WHISPER HEARD
REPEATED IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS SOUL
A WISDOM-CRY FROM RAPT TRANSCENDENCES
SANG ON THE MOUNTAINS OF AN UNSEEN WORLD
THE VOICES THAT AN INNER LISTENING HEARS
CONVEYED TO HIM THEIR PROPHET UTTERANCES
AND FLAME-WRAPPED OUTBURSTS OF THE IMMORTAL WORD
AND FLASHES OF AN OCCULT REVEALING LIGHT
APPROACHED HIM FROM THE UNREACHABLE SECRECY
AN INSPIRED KNOWLEDGE SAT ENTHRONED WITHIN
WHOSE SECONDS ILLUMINED MORE THAN REASON'S YEARS
AN ICTUS OF REVEALING LUSTRE FELL
AS IF A POINTING ACCENT UPON TRUTH
AND LIKE A SKY-FLARE SHOWING ALL THE GROUND
A SWIFT INTUITIVE DISCERNMENT SHONE
38
ONE GLANCE COULD SEPARATE THE TRUE AND FALSE
OR RAISE ITS RAPID TORCH-FIRE IN THE DARK
TO CHECK THE CLAIMANTS CROWDING THROUGH MIND'S GATES
COVERED BY THE FORGED SIGNATURES OF THE GODS
DETECT THE MAGIC BRIDE IN HER DISGUISE
OR SCAN THE APPARENT FACE OF THOUGHT AND LIFE
OFT INSPIRATION WITH HER LIGHTNING FEET
A SUDDEN MESSENGER FROM THE ALL-SEEING TOPS
TRAVERSED THE SOUNDLESS CORRIDORS OF HIS MIND
BRINGING HER RHYTHMIC SENSE OF HIDDEN THINGS
A MUSIC SPOKE TRANSCENDING MORTAL SPEECH
AS IF FROM A GOLDEN PHIAL OF THE ALL-BLISS
A JOY OF LIGHT A JOY OF SUDDEN SIGHT
A RAPTURE OF THE THRILLED UNDYING WORD
POURED INTO HIS HEART AS INTO AN EMPTY CUP
A REPETITION OF GOD'S FIRST DELIGHT
CREATING IN A YOUNG AND VIRGIN TIME
IN A BRIEF MOMENT CAUGHT A LITTLE SPACE
ALL-KNOWLEDGE PACKED INTO GREAT WORDLESS THOUGHTS
LODGED IN THE EXPECTANT STILLNESS OF HIS DEPTHS
A CRYSTAL OF THE ULTIMATE ABSOLUTE
A PORTION OF THE INEXPRESSIBLE TRUTH
REVEALED BY SILENCE TO THE SILENT SOUL
THE INTENSE CREATRIX IN HIS STILLNESS WROUGHT
HER POWER FALLEN SPEECHLESS GREW MORE INTIMATE
SHE LOOKED UPON THE SEEN AND THE UNFORESEEN
UNGUESSED DOMAINS SHE MADE HER NATIVE FIELD
ALL-VISION GATHERED INTO A SINGLE RAY
AS WHEN THE EYES STARE AT AN INVISIBLE POINT
TILL THROUGH THE INTENSITY OF ONE LUMINOUS SPOT
AN APOCALYPSE OF A WORLD OF IMAGES
ENTERS INTO THE KINGDOM OF THE SEER
A GREAT NUDE ARM OF SPLENDOUR SUDDENLY ROSE
IT RENT THE GAUZE OPAQUE OF NESCIENCE
HER LIFTED FINGER'S KEEN UNTHINKABLE TIP
39
BARED WITH A STAB OF FLAME THE CLOSED BEYOND
AN EYE AWAKE IN VOICELESS HEIGHTS OF TRANCE
A MIND PLUCKING AT THE UNIMAGINABLE
OVERLEAPING WITH A SOLE AND PERILOUS BOUND
THE HIGH BLACK WALL HIDING SUPERCONSCIENCE
SHE BROKE IN WITH INSPIRED SPEECH FOR SCYTHE
AND PLUNDERED THE UNKNOWABLE'S VAST ESTATE
A GLEANER OF INFINITESIMAL GRAINS OF TRUTH
A SHEAF-BINDER OF INFINITE EXPERIENCE
SHE PIERCED THE GUARDED MYSTERIES OF WORLD-FORCE
AND HER MAGIC METHODS WRAPPED IN A THOUSAND VEILS
OR SHE GATHERED THE LOST SECRETS DROPPED BY TIME
IN THE DUST AND CRANNIES OF HIS MOUNTING ROUTE
MID OLD FORSAKEN DREAMS OF HASTENING MIND
AND BURIED REMNANTS OF FORGOTTEN SPACE
A TRAVELLER BETWEEN SUMMIT AND ABYSS
SHE JOINED THE DISTANT ENDS THE VIEWLESS DEEPS
OR STREAKED ALONG THE ROADS OF HEAVEN AND HELL
PURSUING ALL KNOWLEDGE LIKE A QUESTING HOUND
A REPORTER AND SCRIBE OF HIDDEN WISDOM TALK
HER SHINING MINUTES OF CELESTIAL SPEECH
PASSED THROUGH THE MASKED OFFICE OF THE OCCULT MIND
TRANSMITTING GAVE TO PROPHET AND TO SEER
THE INSPIRED BODY OF THE MYSTIC TRUTH
A RECORDER OF THE INQUIRY OF THE GODS
SPOKESMAN OF THE SILENT SEEINGS OF THE SUPREME
SHE BROUGHT IMMORTAL WORDS TO MORTAL MEN
ABOVE THE REASON'S BRILLIANT SLENDER CURVE
RELEASED LIKE RADIANT AIR DIMMING A MOON
BROAD SPACES OF A VISION WITHOUT LINE
OR LIMIT SWAM INTO HIS SPIRIT'S KEN
OCEANS OF BEING MET HIS VOYAGING SOUL
CALLING TO INFINITE DISCOVERY
TIMELESS DOMAINS OF JOY AND ABSOLUTE POWER
STRETCHED OUT SURROUNDED BY THE ETERNAL HUSH
THE WAYS THAT LEAD TO ENDLESS HAPPINESS
40
RAN LIKE DREAM-SMILES THROUGH MEDITATING VASTS
DISCLOSED STOOD UP IN A GOLD MOMENT'S BLAZE
WHITE SUN-STEPPES IN THE PATHLESS INFINITE
ALONG A NAKED CURVE IN BOURNELESS SELF
THE POINTS THAT RUN THROUGH THE CLOSED HEART OF THINGS
SHADOWED THE INDETERMINABLE LINE
THAT CARRIES THE EVERLASTING THROUGH THE YEARS
THE MAGICIAN ORDER OF THE COSMIC MIND
COERCING THE FREEDOM OF INFINITY
WITH THE STARK ARRAY OF NATURE'S SYMBOL FACTS
AND LIFE'S INCESSANT SIGNALS OF EVENT
TRANSMUTED CHANCE RECURRENCES INTO LAWS
A CHAOS OF SIGNS INTO A UNIVERSE
OUT OF THE RICH WONDERS AND THE INTRICATE WHORLS
OF THE SPIRIT'S DANCE WITH MATTER AS ITS MASK
THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD'S DESIGN GREW CLEAR
ITS SYMMETRY OF SELF-ARRANGED EFFECTS
MANAGED IN THE DEEP PERSPECTIVES OF THE SOUL
AND THE REALISM OF ITS ILLUSIVE ART
ITS LOGIC OF INFINITE INTELLIGENCE
ITS MAGIC OF A CHANGING ETERNITY
A GLIMPSE WAS CAUGHT OF THINGS FOR EVER UNKNOWN
THE LETTERS STOOD OUT OF THE UNMOVING WORD
IN THE IMMUTABLE NAMELESS ORIGIN
WAS SEEN EMERGING AS FROM FATHOMLESS SEAS
THE TRAIL OF THE IDEAS THAT MADE THE WORLD
AND SOWN IN THE BLACK EARTH OF NATURE'S TRANCE
THE SEED OF THE SPIRIT'S BLIND AND HUGE DESIRE
FROM WHICH THE TREE OF COSMOS WAS CONCEIVED
AND SPREAD ITS MAGIC ARMS THROUGH A DREAM OF SPACE
IMMENSE REALITIES TOOK ON A SHAPE
THERE LOOKED OUT FROM THE SHADOW OF THE UNKNOWN
THE BODILESS NAMELESSNESS THAT SAW GOD BORN
AND TRIES TO GAIN FROM THE MORTAL'S MIND AND SOUL
A DEATHLESS BODY AND A DIVINE NAME
THE IMMOBILE LIPS THE GREAT SURREAL WINGS
41
THE VISAGE MASKED BY SUPERCONSCIENT SLEEP
THE EYES WITH THEIR CLOSED LIDS THAT SEE ALL THINGS
APPEARED OF THE ARCHITECT WHO BUILDS IN TRANCE
THE ORIGINAL DESIRE BORN IN THE VOID
PEERED OUT HE SAW THE HOPE THAT NEVER SLEEPS
THE FEET THAT RUN BEHIND A FLEETING FATE
THE INEFFABLE MEANING OF THE ENDLESS DREAM
HARDLY FOR A MOMENT GLIMPSED VIEWLESS TO MIND
AS IF A TORCH HELD BY A POWER OF GOD
THE RADIANT WORLD OF THE EVERLASTING TRUTH
GLIMMERED LIKE A FAINT STAR BORDERING THE NIGHT
ABOVE THE GOLDEN OVERMIND'S SHIMMERING RIDGE
EVEN WERE CAUGHT AS THROUGH A CUNNING VEIL
THE SMILE OF LOVE THAT SANCTIONS THE LONG GAME
THE CALM INDULGENCE AND MATERNAL BREASTS
OF WISDOM SUCKLING THE CHILD-LAUGHTER OF CHANCE
SILENCE THE NURSE OF THE ALMIGHTY'S POWER
THE OMNISCIENT HUSH WOMB OF THE IMMORTAL WORD
AND OF THE TIMELESS THE STILL BROODING FACE
AND THE CREATIVE EYE OF ETERNITY
THE INSPIRING GODDESS ENTERED A MORTAL'S BREAST
MADE THERE HER STUDY OF DIVINING THOUGHT
AND SANCTUARY OF PROPHETIC SPEECH
AND SAT UPON THE TRIPOD SEAT OF MIND
ALL WAS MADE WIDE ABOVE ALL LIT BELOW
IN DARKNESS' CORE SHE DUG OUT WELLS OF LIGHT
ON THE UNDISCOVERED DEPTHS IMPOSED A FORM
LENT A VIBRANT CRY TO THE UNUTTERED VASTS
AND THROUGH GREAT SHORELESS VOICELESS STARLESS BREADTHS
BORE EARTHWARD FRAGMENTS OF REVEALING THOUGHT
HEWN FROM THE SILENCE OF THE INEFFABLE
A VOICE IN THE HEART UTTERED THE UNSPOKEN NAME
A DREAM OF SEEKING THOUGHT WANDERING THROUGH SPACE
ENTERED THE INVISIBLE AND FORBIDDEN HOUSE
THE TREASURE WAS FOUND OF A SUPERNAL DAY
IN THE DEEP SUBCONSCIENT GLOWED HER JEWEL-LAMP
42
LIFTED IT SHOWED THE RICHES OF THE CAVE
WHERE BY THE MISER TRAFFICKERS OF SENSE
UNUSED GUARDED BENEATH NIGHT'S DRAGON PAWS
IN FOLDS OF VELVET DARKNESS DRAPED THEY SLEEP
WHOSE PRICELESS VALUE COULD HAVE SAVED THE WORLD
A DARKNESS CARRYING MORNING IN ITS BREAST
LOOKED FOR THE ETERNAL WIDE RETURNING GLEAM
WAITING THE ADVENT OF A LARGER RAY
AND RESCUE OF THE LOST HERDS OF THE SUN
IN A SPLENDID EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE WASTE OF GOD
DROPPED CARELESSLY IN CREATION'S SPENDTHRIFT WORK
LEFT IN THE CHANTIERS OF THE BOTTOMLESS WORLD
AND STOLEN BY THE ROBBERS OF THE DEEP
THE GOLDEN SHEKELS OF THE ETERNAL LIE
HOARDED FROM TOUCH AND VIEW AND THOUGHT'S DESIRE
LOCKED IN BLIND ANTRES OF THE IGNORANT FLOOD
LEST MEN SHOULD FIND THEM AND BE EVEN AS GODS
A VISION LIGHTENED ON THE VIEWLESS HEIGHTS
A WISDOM ILLUMINED FROM THE VOICELESS DEPTHS
A DEEPER INTERPRETATION GREATENED TRUTH
A GRAND REVERSAL OF THE NIGHT AND DAY
ALL THE WORLD'S VALUES CHANGED HEIGHTENING LIFE'S AIM
A WISER WORD A LARGER THOUGHT CAME IN
THAN WHAT THE SLOW LABOUR OF HUMAN MIND CAN BRING
A SECRET SENSE AWOKE THAT COULD PERCEIVE
A PRESENCE AND A GREATNESS EVERYWHERE
THE UNIVERSE WAS NOT NOW THIS SENSELESS WHIRL
BORNE ROUND INERT ON AN IMMENSE MACHINE
IT CAST AWAY ITS GRANDIOSE LIFELESS FRONT
A MECHANISM NO MORE OR WORK OF CHANCE
BUT A LIVING MOVEMENT OF THE BODY OF GOD
A SPIRIT HID IN FORCES AND IN FORMS
WAS THE SPECTATOR OF THE MOBILE SCENE
THE BEAUTY AND THE CEASELESS MIRACLE
LET IN A GLOW OF THE UNMANIFEST
THE FORMLESS EVERLASTING MOVED IN IT
43
SEEKING ITS OWN PERFECT FORM IN SOULS AND THINGS
LIFE KEPT NO MORE A DULL AND MEANINGLESS SHAPE
IN THE STRUGGLE AND UPHEAVAL OF THE WORLD
HE SAW THE LABOUR OF A GODHEAD'S BIRTH
A SECRET KNOWLEDGE MASKED AS IGNORANCE
FATE COVERED WITH AN UNSEEN NECESSITY
THE GAME OF CHANCE OF AN OMNIPOTENT WILL
A GLORY AND A RAPTURE AND A CHARM
THE ALL-BLISSFUL SAT UNKNOWN WITHIN THE HEART
EARTH'S PAINS WERE THE RANSOM OF ITS PRISONED DELIGHT
A GLAD COMMUNION TINGED THE PASSING HOURS
THE DAYS WERE TRAVELLERS ON A DESTINED ROAD
THE NIGHTS COMPANIONS OF HIS MUSING SPIRIT
A HEAVENLY IMPETUS QUICKENED ALL HIS BREAST
THE TRUDGE OF TIME CHANGED TO A SPLENDID MARCH
THE DIVINE DWARF TOWERED TO UNCONQUERED WORLDS
EARTH GREW TOO NARROW FOR HIS VICTORY
ONCE ONLY REGISTERING THE HEAVY TREAD
OF A BLIND POWER ON HUMAN LITTLENESS
LIFE NOW BECAME A SURE APPROACH TO GOD
EXISTENCE A DIVINE EXPERIMENT
AND COSMOS THE SOUL'S OPPORTUNITY
THE WORLD WAS A CONCEPTION AND A BIRTH
OF SPIRIT IN MATTER INTO LIVING FORMS
AND NATURE BORE THE IMMORTAL IN HER WOMB
THAT SHE MIGHT CLIMB THROUGH HIM TO ETERNAL LIFE
HIS BEING LAY DOWN IN BRIGHT IMMOBILE PEACE
AND BATHED IN WELLS OF PURE SPIRITUAL LIGHT
IT WANDERED IN WIDE FIELDS OF WISDOM-SELF
LIT BY THE RAYS OF AN EVERLASTING SUN
EVEN HIS BODY'S SUBTLE SELF WITHIN
COULD RAISE THE EARTHLY PARTS TOWARDS HIGHER THINGS
AND FEEL ON IT THE BREATH OF HEAVENLIER AIR
ALREADY IT JOURNEYED TOWARDS DIVINITY
UPBUOYED UPON WINGED WINDS OF RAPID JOY
UPHELD TO A LIGHT IT COULD NOT ALWAYS HOLD
44
IT LEFT MIND'S DISTANCE FROM THE TRUTH SUPREME
AND LOST LIFE'S INCAPACITY FOR BLISS
ALL NOW SUPPRESSED IN US BEGAN TO EMERGE
THUS CAME HIS SOUL'S RELEASE FROM IGNORANCE
HIS MIND AND BODY'S FIRST SPIRITUAL CHANGE
A WIDE GOD-KNOWLEDGE POURED DOWN FROM ABOVE
A NEW WORLD-KNOWLEDGE BROADENED FROM WITHIN
HIS DAILY THOUGHTS LOOKED UP TO THE TRUE AND ONE
HIS COMMONEST DOINGS WELLED FROM AN INNER LIGHT
AWAKENED TO THE LINES THAT NATURE HIDES
ATTUNED TO HER MOVEMENTS THAT EXCEED OUR KEN
HE GREW ONE WITH A COVERT UNIVERSE
HIS GRASP SURPRISED HER MIGHTIEST ENERGIES' SPRINGS
HE SPOKE WITH THE UNKNOWN GUARDIANS OF THE WORLDS
FORMS HE DESCRIED OUR MORTAL EYES SEE NOT
HIS WIDE EYES BODIED VIEWLESS ENTITIES
HE SAW THE COSMIC FORCES AT THEIR WORK
AND FELT THE OCCULT IMPULSE BEHIND MAN'S WILL
TIME'S SECRETS WERE TO HIM AN OFT-READ BOOK
THE RECORDS OF THE FUTURE AND THE PAST
OUTLINED THEIR EXCERPTS ON THE ETHERIC PAGE
ONE AND HARMONIOUS BY THE MAKER'S SKILL
THE HUMAN IN HIM PACED WITH THE DIVINE
HIS ACTS BETRAYED NOT THE INTERIOR FLAME
THIS FORGED THE GREATNESS OF HIS FRONT TO EARTH
A GENIUS HEIGHTENED IN HIS BODY'S CELLS
THAT KNEW THE MEANING OF HIS FATE-HEDGED WORKS
AKIN TO THE MARCH OF UNACCOMPLISHED POWERS
BEYOND LIFE'S ARC IN SPIRIT'S IMMENSITIES
APART HE LIVED IN HIS MIND'S SOLITUDE
A DEMIGOD SHAPING THE LIVES OF MEN
ONE SOUL'S AMBITION LIFTED UP THE RACE
A POWER WORKED BUT NONE KNEW WHENCE IT CAME
THE UNIVERSAL STRENGTHS WERE LINKED WITH HIS
FILLING EARTH'S SMALLNESS WITH THEIR BOUNDLESS BREADTHS
45
HE DREW THE ENERGIES THAT TRANSMUTE AN AGE
IMMEASURABLE BY THE COMMON LOOK
HE MADE GREAT DREAMS A MOULD FOR COMING THINGS
AND CAST HIS DEEDS LIKE BRONZE TO FRONT THE YEARS
HIS WALK THROUGH TIME OUTSTRIPPED THE HUMAN STRIDE
LONELY HIS DAYS AND SPLENDID LIKE THE SUN'S
46
ON A HEIGHT HE STOOD THAT LOOKED TOWARDS GREATER HEIGHTS
OUR EARLY APPROACHES TO THE INFINITE
ARE SUNRISE SPLENDOURS ON A MARVELLOUS VERGE
WHILE LINGERS YET UNSEEN THE GLORIOUS SUN
WHAT NOW WE SEE IS A SHADOW OF WHAT MUST COME
THE EARTH'S UPLOOK TO A REMOTE UNKNOWN
IS A PREFACE ONLY OF THE EPIC CLIMB
OF HUMAN SOUL FROM ITS FLAT EARTHLY STATE
TO THE DISCOVERY OF A GREATER SELF
AND THE FAR GLEAM OF AN ETERNAL LIGHT
THIS WORLD IS A BEGINNING AND A BASE
WHERE LIFE AND MIND ERECT THEIR STRUCTURED DREAMS
AN UNBORN POWER MUST BUILD REALITY
A DEATHBOUND LITTLENESS IS NOT ALL WE ARE
IMMORTAL OUR FORGOTTEN VASTNESSES
AWAIT DISCOVERY IN OUR SUMMIT SELVES
UNMEASURED BREADTHS AND DEPTHS OF BEING ARE OURS
AKIN TO THE INEFFABLE SECRECY
MYSTIC ETERNAL IN UNREALISED TIME
NEIGHBOURS OF HEAVEN ARE NATURE'S ALTITUDES
TO THESE HIGH-PEAKED DOMINIONS SEALED TO OUR SEARCH
TOO FAR FROM SURFACE NATURE'S POSTAL ROUTES
TOO LOFTY FOR OUR MORTAL LIVES TO BREATHE
DEEP IN US A FORGOTTEN KINSHIP POINTS
AND A FAINT VOICE OF ECSTASY AND PRAYER
CALLS TO THOSE LUCENT LOST IMMENSITIES
EVEN WHEN WE FAIL TO LOOK INTO OUR SOULS
OR LIE EMBEDDED IN EARTHLY CONSCIOUSNESS
STILL HAVE WE PARTS THAT GROW TOWARDS THE LIGHT
YET ARE THERE LUMINOUS TRACTS AND HEAVENS SERENE
AND ELDORADOS OF SPLENDOUR AND ECSTASY
47
AND TEMPLES TO THE GODHEAD NONE CAN SEE
A SHAPELESS MEMORY LINGERS IN US STILL
AND SOMETIMES WHEN OUR SIGHT IS TURNED WITHIN
EARTH'S IGNORANT VEIL IS LIFTED FROM OUR EYES
THERE IS A SHORT MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
THIS NARROW FRINGE OF CLAMPED EXPERIENCE
WE LEAVE BEHIND METED TO US AS LIFE
OUR LITTLE WALKS OUR INSUFFICIENT REACH
OUR SOULS CAN VISIT IN GREAT LONELY HOURS
STILL REGIONS OF IMPERISHABLE LIGHT
ALL-SEEING EAGLE-PEAKS OF SILENT POWER
AND MOON-FLAME OCEANS OF SWIFT FATHOMLESS BLISS
AND CALM IMMENSITIES OF SPIRIT SPACE
IN THE UNFOLDING PROCESS OF THE SELF
SOMETIMES THE INEXPRESSIBLE MYSTERY
ELECTS A HUMAN VESSEL OF DESCENT
A BREATH COMES DOWN FROM A SUPERNAL AIR
A PRESENCE IS BORN A GUIDING LIGHT AWAKES
A STILLNESS FALLS UPON THE INSTRUMENTS
FIXED MOTIONLESS LIKE A MARBLE MONUMENT
STONE-CALM THE BODY IS A PEDESTAL
SUPPORTING A FIGURE OF ETERNAL PEACE
OR A REVEALING FORCE SWEEPS BLAZING IN
OUT OF SOME VAST SUPERIOR CONTINENT
KNOWLEDGE BREAKS THROUGH TRAILING ITS RADIANT SEAS
AND NATURE TREMBLES WITH THE POWER THE FLAME
A GREATER PERSONALITY SOMETIMES
POSSESSES US WHICH YET WE KNOW IS OURS
OR WE ADORE THE MASTER OF OUR SOULS
THEN THE SMALL BODILY EGO THINS AND FALLS
NO MORE INSISTING ON ITS SEPARATE SELF
LOSING THE PUNCTILIO OF ITS SEPARATE BIRTH
IT LEAVES US ONE WITH NATURE AND WITH GOD
IN MOMENTS WHEN THE INNER LAMPS ARE LIT
AND THE LIFE'S CHERISHED GUESTS ARE LEFT OUTSIDE
OUR SPIRIT SITS ALONE AND SPEAKS TO ITS GULFS
48
A WIDER CONSCIOUSNESS OPENS THEN ITS DOORS
INVADING FROM SPIRITUAL SILENCES
A RAY OF THE TIMELESS GLORY STOOPS AWHILE
TO COMMUNE WITH OUR SEIZED ILLUMINED CLAY
AND LEAVES ITS HUGE WHITE STAMP UPON OUR LIVES
IN THE OBLIVIOUS FIELD OF MORTAL MIND
REVEALED TO THE CLOSED PROPHET EYES OF TRANCE
OR IN SOME DEEP INTERNAL SOLITUDE
WITNESSED BY A STRANGE IMMATERIAL SENSE
THE SIGNALS OF ETERNITY APPEAR
THE TRUTH MIND COULD NOT KNOW UNVEILS ITS FACE
WE HEAR WHAT MORTAL EARS HAVE NEVER HEARD
WE FEEL WHAT EARTHLY SENSE HAS NEVER FELT
WE LOVE WHAT COMMON HEARTS REPEL AND DREAD
OUR MINDS HUSH TO A BRIGHT OMNISCIENT
A VOICE CALLS FROM THE CHAMBERS OF THE SOUL
WE MEET THE ECSTASY OF THE GODHEAD'S TOUCH
IN GOLDEN PRIVACIES OF IMMORTAL FIRE
THESE SIGNS ARE NATIVE TO A LARGER SELF
THAT LIVES WITHIN US BY OURSELVES UNSEEN
ONLY SOMETIMES A HOLIER INFLUENCE COMES
A TIDE OF MIGHTIER SURGINGS BEARS OUR LIVES
AND A DIVINER PRESENCE MOVES THE SOUL
OR THROUGH THE EARTHLY COVERINGS SOMETHING BREAKS
A GRACE AND BEAUTY OF SPIRITUAL LIGHT
THE MURMURING TONGUE OF A CELESTIAL FIRE
OURSELF AND A HIGH STRANGER WHOM WE FEEL
IT IS AND ACTS UNSEEN AS IF IT WERE NOT
IT FOLLOWS THE LINE OF SEMPITERNAL BIRTH
YET SEEMS TO PERISH WITH ITS MORTAL FRAME
ASSURED OF THE APOCALYPSE TO BE
IT RECKONS NOT THE MOMENTS AND THE HOURS
GREAT PATIENT CALM IT SEES THE CENTURIES PASS
AWAITING THE SLOW MIRACLE OF OUR CHANGE
IN THE SURE DELIBERATE PROCESS OF WORLD-FORCE
AND THE LONG MARCH OF ALL-REVEALING TIME
49
IT IS THE ORIGIN AND THE MASTER-CLUE
A SILENCE OVERHEAD AN INNER VOICE
A LIVING IMAGE SEATED IN THE HEART
AN UNWALLED WIDENESS AND A FATHOMLESS POINT
THE TRUTH OF ALL THESE CRYPTIC SHOWS IN SPACE
THE REAL TOWARDS WHICH OUR STRIVINGS MOVE
THE SECRET GRANDIOSE MEANING OF OUR LIVES
A TREASURE OF HONEY IN THE COMBS OF GOD
A SPLENDOUR BURNING IN A TENEBROUS CLOAK
IT IS OUR GLORY OF THE FLAME OF GOD
OUR GOLDEN FOUNTAIN OF THE WORLD'S DELIGHT
AN IMMORTALITY COWLED IN THE CAPE OF DEATH
THE SHAPE OF OUR UNBORN DIVINITY
IT GUARDS FOR US OUR FATE IN DEPTHS WITHIN
WHERE SLEEPS THE ETERNAL SEED OF TRANSIENT THINGS
ALWAYS WE BEAR IN US A MAGIC KEY
CONCEALED IN LIFE'S HERMETIC ENVELOPE
A BURNING WITNESS IN THE SANCTUARY
REGARDS THROUGH TIME AND THE BLIND WALLS OF FORM
A TIMELESS LIGHT IS IN HIS HIDDEN EYES
HE SEES THE SECRET THINGS NO WORDS CAN SPEAK
AND KNOWS THE GOAL OF THE UNCONSCIOUS WORLD
AND THE HEART OF THE MYSTERY OF THE JOURNEYING YEARS
BUT ALL IS SCREENED SUBLIMINAL MYSTICAL
IT NEEDS THE INTUITIVE HEART THE INWARD TURN
IT NEEDS THE POWER OF A SPIRITUAL GAZE
ELSE TO OUR WAKING MIND'S SMALL MOMENT LOOK
A GOALLESS VOYAGE SEEMS OUR DUBIOUS COURSE
SOME CHANCE HAS SETTLED OR HAZARDED SOME WILL
OR A NECESSITY WITHOUT AIM OR CAUSE
UNWILLINGLY COMPELLED TO EMERGE AND BE
IN THIS DENSE FIELD WHERE NOTHING IS PLAIN OR SURE
OUR VERY BEING SEEMS TO US QUESTIONABLE
OUR LIFE A VAGUE EXPERIMENT THE SOUL
A FLICKERING LIGHT IN A STRANGE IGNORANT WORLD
50
THE EARTH A BRUTE MECHANIC ACCIDENT
A NET OF DEATH IN WHICH BY CHANCE WE LIVE
ALL WE HAVE LEARNED APPEARS A DOUBTFUL GUESS
THE ACHIEVEMENT DONE A PASSAGE OR A PHASE
WHOSE FARTHER END IS HIDDEN FROM OUR SIGHT
A CHANCE HAPPENING OR A FORTUITOUS FATE
OUT OF THE UNKNOWN WE MOVE TO THE UNKNOWN
EVER SURROUND OUR BRIEF EXISTENCE HERE
GREY SHADOWS OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONINGS
THE DARK INCONSCIENT'S SIGNLESS MYSTERIES
STAND UP UNSOLVED BEHIND FATE'S STARTING-LINE
AN ASPIRATION IN THE NIGHT'S PROFOUND
SEED OF A PERISHING BODY AND HALF-LIT MIND
UPLIFTS ITS LONELY TONGUE OF CONSCIOUS FIRE
TOWARDS AN UNDYING LIGHT FOR EVER LOST
ONLY IT HEARS SOLE ECHO OF ITS CALL
THE DIM REPLY IN MAN'S UNKNOWING HEART
AND MEETS NOT UNDERSTANDING WHY IT CAME
OR FOR WHAT REASON IS THE SUFFERING HERE
GOD'S SANCTION TO THE PARADOX OF LIFE
AND THE RIDDLE OF THE IMMORTAL'S BIRTH IN TIME
ALONG A PATH OF AEONS SERPENTINE
IN THE COILED BLACKNESS OF HER NESCIENT COURSE
THE EARTH-GODDESS TOILS ACROSS THE SANDS OF TIME
A BEING IS IN HER WHOM SHE HOPES TO KNOW
A WORD SPEAKS TO HER HEART SHE CANNOT HEAR
A FATE COMPELS WHOSE FORM SHE CANNOT SEE
IN HER UNCONSCIOUS ORBIT THROUGH THE VOID
OUT OF HER MINDLESS DEPTHS SHE STRIVES TO RISE
A PERILOUS LIFE HER GAIN A STRUGGLING JOY
A THOUGHT THAT CAN CONCEIVE BUT HARDLY KNOWS
ARISES SLOWLY IN HER AND CREATES
THE IDEA THE SPEECH THAT LABELS MORE THAN IT LIGHTS
A TREMBLING GLADNESS THAT IS LESS THAN BLISS
INVADES FROM ALL THIS BEAUTY THAT MUST DIE
ALARMED BY THE SORROW DRAGGING AT HER FEET
51
AND CONSCIOUS OF THE HIGH THINGS NOT YET WON
EVER SHE NURSES IN HER SLEEPLESS BREAST
AN INWARD URGE THAT TAKES FROM HER REST AND PEACE
IGNORANT AND WEARY AND INVINCIBLE
SHE SEEKS THROUGH THE SOUL'S WAR AND QUIVERING PAIN
THE PURE PERFECTION HER MARRED NATURE NEEDS
A BREATH OF GODHEAD ON HER STONE AND MIRE
A FAITH SHE CRAVES THAT CAN SURVIVE DEFEAT
THE SWEETNESS OF A LOVE THAT KNOWS NOT DEATH
THE RADIANCE OF A TRUTH FOR EVER SURE
A LIGHT GROWS IN HER SHE ASSUMES A VOICE
HER STATE SHE LEARNS TO READ AND THE ACT SHE HAS DONE
BUT THE ONE NEEDED TRUTH ELUDES HER GRASP
HERSELF AND ALL OF WHICH SHE IS THE SIGN
AN INARTICULATE WHISPER DRIVES HER STEPS
OF WHICH SHE FEELS THE FORCE BUT NOT THE SENSE
A FEW RARE INTIMATIONS COME AS GUIDES
IMMENSE DIVINING FLASHES CLEAVE HER BRAIN
AND SOMETIMES IN HER HOURS OF DREAM AND MUSE
THE TRUTH THAT SHE HAS MISSED LOOKS OUT ON HER
AS IF FAR OFF AND YET WITHIN HER SOUL
A CHANGE COMES NEAR THAT FLEES FROM HER SURMISE
AND EVER POSTPONED COMPELS ATTEMPT AND HOPE
YET SEEMS TOO GREAT FOR MORTAL HOPE TO DARE
A VISION MEETS HER OF SUPERNAL POWERS
THAT DRAW HER AS IF MIGHTY KINSMEN LOST
APPROACHING WITH ESTRANGED GREAT LUMINOUS GAZE
THEN IS SHE MOVED TO ALL THAT SHE IS NOT
AND STRETCHES ARMS TO WHAT WAS NEVER HERS
OUTSTRETCHING ARMS TO THE UNCONSCIOUS VOID
PASSIONATE SHE PRAYS TO INVISIBLE FORMS OF GODS
SOLICITING FROM DUMB FATE AND TOILING TIME
WHAT MOST SHE NEEDS WHAT MOST EXCEEDS HER SCOPE
A MIND UNVISITED BY ILLUSION'S GLEAMS
A WILL EXPRESSIVE OF SOUL'S DEITY
A STRENGTH NOT FORCED TO STUMBLE BY ITS SPEED
52
A JOY THAT DRAGS NOT SORROW AS ITS SHADE
FOR THESE SHE YEARNS AND FEELS THEM DESTINED HERS
HEAVEN'S PRIVILEGE SHE CLAIMS AS HER OWN RIGHT
JUST IS HER CLAIM THE ALL-WITNESSING GODS APPROVE
CLEAR IN A GREATER LIGHT THAN REASON OWNS
OUR INTUITIONS ARE ITS TITLE-DEEDS
OUR SOULS ACCEPT WHAT OUR BLIND THOUGHTS REFUSE
EARTH'S WINGED CHIMAERAS ARE TRUTH'S STEEDS IN HEAVEN
THE IMPOSSIBLE GOD'S SIGN OF THINGS TO BE
BUT FEW CAN LOOK BEYOND THE PRESENT STATE
OR OVERLEAP THIS MATTED HEDGE OF SENSE
ALL THAT TRANSPIRES ON EARTH AND ALL BEYOND
ARE PARTS OF AN ILLIMITABLE PLAN
THE ONE KEEPS IN HIS HEART AND KNOWS ALONE
OUR OUTWARD HAPPENINGS HAVE THEIR SEED WITHIN
AND EVEN THIS RANDOM FATE THAT IMITATES CHANCE
THIS MASS OF UNINTELLIGIBLE RESULTS
ARE THE DUMB GRAPH OF TRUTHS THAT WORK UNSEEN
THE LAWS OF THE UNKNOWN CREATE THE KNOWN
THE EVENTS THAT SHAPE THE APPEARANCE OF OUR LIVES
ARE A CIPHER OF SUBLIMINAL QUIVERINGS
WHICH RARELY WE SURPRISE OR VAGUELY FEEL
ARE AN OUTCOME OF SUPPRESSED REALITIES
THAT HARDLY RISE INTO MATERIAL DAY
THEY ARE BORN FROM THE SPIRIT'S SUN OF HIDDEN POWERS
DIGGING A TUNNEL THROUGH EMERGENCY
BUT WHO SHALL PIERCE INTO THE CRYPTIC GULF
AND LEARN WHAT DEEP NECESSITY OF THE SOUL
DETERMINED CASUAL DEED AND CONSEQUENCE
ABSORBED IN A ROUTINE OF DAILY ACTS
OUR EYES ARE FIXED ON AN EXTERNAL SCENE
WE HEAR THE CRASH OF THE WHEELS OF CIRCUMSTANCE
AND WONDER AT THE HIDDEN CAUSE OF THINGS
YET A FORESEEING KNOWLEDGE MIGHT BE OURS
IF WE COULD TAKE OUR SPIRIT'S STAND WITHIN
IF WE COULD HEAR THE MUFFLED DAEMON VOICE
53
TOO SELDOM IS THE SHADOW OF WHAT MUST COME
CAST IN AN INSTANT ON THE SECRET SENSE
WHICH FEELS THE SHOCK OF THE INVISIBLE
AND SELDOM IN THE FEW WHO ANSWER GIVE
THE MIGHTY PROCESS OF THE COSMIC WILL
COMMUNICATES ITS IMAGE TO OUR SIGHT
IDENTIFYING THE WORLD'S MIND WITH OURS
OUR RANGE IS FIXED WITHIN THE CROWDED ARC
OF WHAT WE OBSERVE AND TOUCH AND THOUGHT CAN GUESS
AND RARELY DAWNS THE LIGHT OF THE UNKNOWN
WAKING IN US THE PROPHET AND THE SEER
THE OUTWARD AND THE IMMEDIATE ARE OUR FIELD
THE DEAD PAST IS OUR BACKGROUND AND SUPPORT
MIND KEEPS THE SOUL PRISONER WE ARE SLAVES TO OUR ACTS
WE CANNOT FREE OUR GAZE TO REACH WISDOM'S SUN
INHERITOR OF THE BRIEF ANIMAL MIND
MAN STILL A CHILD IN NATURE'S MIGHTY HANDS
IN THE SUCCESSION OF THE MOMENTS LIVES
TO A CHANGING PRESENT IS HIS NARROW RIGHT
HIS MEMORY STARES BACK AT A PHANTOM PAST
THE FUTURE FLEES BEFORE HIM AS HE MOVES
HE SEES IMAGINED GARMENTS NOT A FACE
ARMED WITH A LIMITED PRECARIOUS STRENGTH
HE SAVES HIS FRUITS OF WORK FROM ADVERSE CHANCE
A STRUGGLING IGNORANCE IS HIS WISDOM'S MATE
HE WAITS TO SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS ACTS
HE WAITS TO WEIGH THE CERTITUDE OF HIS THOUGHTS
HE KNOWS NOT WHAT HE SHALL ACHIEVE OR WHEN
HE KNOWS NOT WHETHER AT LAST HE SHALL SURVIVE
OR END LIKE THE MASTODON AND THE SLOTH
AND PERISH FROM THE EARTH WHERE HE WAS KING
HE IS IGNORANT OF THE MEANING OF HIS LIFE
HE IS IGNORANT OF HIS HIGH AND SPLENDID FATE
ONLY THE IMMORTALS ON THEIR DEATHLESS HEIGHTS
DWELLING BEYOND THE WALLS OF TIME AND SPACE
MASTERS OF LIVING FREE FROM THE BONDS OF THOUGHT
54
WHO ARE OVERSEERS OF FATE AND CHANCE AND WILL
AND EXPERTS OF THE THEOREM OF WORLD-NEED
CAN SEE THE IDEA THE MIGHT THAT CHANGE TIME'S COURSE
COME MANED WITH LIGHT FROM UNDISCOVERED WORLDS
HEAR WHILE THE WORLD TOILS ON WITH ITS DEEP BLIND HEART
THE GALLOPING HOOVES OF THE UNFORESEEN EVENT
BEARING THE SUPERHUMAN RIDER NEAR
AND IMPASSIVE TO EARTH'S DIN AND STARTLED CRY
RETURN TO THE SILENCE OF THE HILLS OF GOD
AS LIGHTNING LEAPS AS THUNDER SWEEPS THEY PASS
AND LEAVE THEIR MARK ON THE TRAMPLED BREAST OF LIFE
ABOVE THE WORLD THE WORLD-CREATORS STAND
IN THE PHENOMENON SEE ITS MYSTIC SOURCE
THESE HEED NOT THE DECEIVING OUTWARD PLAY
THEY TURN NOT TO THE MOMENT'S BUSY TRAMP
BUT LISTEN WITH THE STILL PATIENCE OF THE UNBORN
FOR THE SLOW FOOTSTEPS OF FAR DESTINY
APPROACHING THROUGH HUGE DISTANCES OF TIME
UNMARKED BY THE EYE THAT SEES EFFECT AND CAUSE
UNHEARD MID THE CLAMOUR OF THE HUMAN PLANE
ATTENTIVE TO AN UNSEEN TRUTH THEY SEIZE
A SOUND AS OF INVISIBLE AUGUR WINGS
VOICES OF AN UNPLUMBED SIGNIFICANCE
MUTTERINGS THAT BROOD IN THE CORE OF MATTER'S SLEEP
IN THE HEART'S PROFOUND AUDITION THEY CAN CATCH
THE MURMURS LOST BY LIFE'S UNCARING EAR
A PROPHET-SPEECH IN THOUGHT'S OMNISCIENT TRANCE
ABOVE THE ILLUSION OF THE HOPES THAT PASS
BEHIND THE APPEARANCE AND THE OVERT ACT
BEHIND THIS CLOCK-WORK CHANCE AND VAGUE SURMISE
AMID THE WRESTLE OF FORCE THE TRAMPLING FEET
ACROSS THE CRIES OF ANGUISH AND OF JOY
ACROSS THE TRIUMPH FIGHTING AND DESPAIR
THEY WATCH THE BLISS FOR WHICH EARTH'S HEART HAS CRIED
ON THE LONG ROAD WHICH CANNOT SEE ITS END
WINDING UNDETECTED THROUGH THE SCEPTIC DAYS

AND TO MEET IT GUIDE THE UNHEEDFUL MOVING WORLD
THUS WILL THE MASKED TRANSCENDENT MOUNT HIS THRONE
WHEN DARKNESS DEEPENS STRANGLING THE EARTH'S BREAST
AND MAN'S CORPOREAL MIND IS THE ONLY LAMP
AS A THIEF'S IN THE NIGHT SHALL BE THE COVERT TREAD
OF ONE WHO STEPS UNSEEN INTO HIS HOUSE
A VOICE ILL-HEARD SHALL SPEAK THE SOUL OBEY
A POWER INTO MIND'S INNER CHAMBER STEAL
A CHARM AND SWEETNESS OPEN LIFE'S CLOSED DOORS
AND BEAUTY CONQUER THE RESISTING WORLD
THE TRUTH-LIGHT CAPTURE NATURE BY SURPRISE
A STEALTH OF GOD COMPEL THE HEART TO BLISS
AND EARTH GROW UNEXPECTEDLY DIVINE
IN MATTER SHALL BE LIT THE SPIRIT'S GLOW
IN BODY AND BODY KINDLED THE SACRED BIRTH
NIGHT SHALL AWAKE TO THE ANTHEM OF THE STARS
THE DAYS BECOME A HAPPY PILGRIM MARCH
OUR WILL A FORCE OF THE ETERNAL'S POWER
AND THOUGHT THE RAYS OF A SPIRITUAL SUN
A FEW SHALL SEE WHAT NONE YET UNDERSTANDS
GOD SHALL GROW UP WHILE THE WISE MEN TALK AND SLEEP
FOR MAN SHALL NOT KNOW THE COMING TILL ITS HOUR
AND BELIEF SHALL BE NOT TILL THE WORK IS DONE
A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN TRUTH
A VAGRANT HUNTER OF MISLEADING DAWNS
BETWEEN THE BEING'S DARK AND LUMINOUS ENDS
MOVES HERE IN A HALF-LIGHT THAT SEEMS THE WHOLE
AN INTERREGNUM IN REALITY
CUTS OFF THE INTEGRAL THOUGHT THE TOTAL POWER
IT CIRCLES OR STANDS IN A VAGUE INTERSPACE
DOUBTFUL OF ITS BEGINNING AND ITS CLOSE
OR RUNS UPON A ROAD THAT HAS NO END
FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL DUSK THE FINAL FLAME
IN SOME HUGE VOID INCONSCIENCE IT LIVES
LIKE A THOUGHT PERSISTING IN A WIDE EMPTINESS
56
AS IF AN UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE
SUGGESTED A MILLION RENDERINGS TO THE MIND
IT LENDS A PURPORT TO A RANDOM WORLD
A CONJECTURE LEANING UPON DOUBTFUL PROOFS
A MESSAGE MISUNDERSTOOD A THOUGHT CONFUSED
MISSING ITS AIM IS ALL THAT IT CAN SPEAK
OR A FRAGMENT OF THE UNIVERSAL WORD
IT LEAVES TWO GIANT LETTERS VOID OF SENSE
WHILE WITHOUT SANCTION TURNS THE MIDDLE SIGN
CARRYING AN ENIGMATIC UNIVERSE
AS IF A PRESENT WITHOUT FUTURE OR PAST
REPEATING THE SAME REVOLUTION'S WHIRL
TURNED ON ITS AXIS IN ITS OWN INANE
THUS IS THE MEANING OF CREATION VEILED
FOR WITHOUT CONTEXT READS THE COSMIC PAGE
ITS SIGNS STARE AT US LIKE AN UNKNOWN SCRIPT
AS IF APPEARED SCREENED BY A FOREIGN TONGUE
OR CODE OF SPLENDOUR SIGNS WITHOUT A KEY
A PORTION OF A PARABLE SUBLIME
IT WEARS TO THE PERISHABLE CREATURE'S EYES
THE GRANDEUR OF A USELESS MIRACLE
WASTING ITSELF THAT IT MAY LAST AWHILE
A RIVER THAT CAN NEVER FIND ITS SEA
IT RUNS THROUGH LIFE AND DEATH ON AN EDGE OF TIME
A FIRE IN THE NIGHT IS ITS MIGHTY ACTION'S BLAZE
THIS IS OUR DEEPEST NEED TO JOIN ONCE MORE
WHAT NOW IS PARTED OPPOSITE AND TWAIN
REMOTE IN SOVEREIGN SPHERES THAT NEVER MEET
OR FRONTING LIKE FAR POLES OF NIGHT AND DAY
WE MUST FILL THE IMMENSE LACUNA WE HAVE MADE
RE-WED THE CLOSED FINITE'S LONELY CONSONANT
WITH THE OPEN VOWELS OF INFINITY
A HYPHEN MUST CONNECT MATTER AND MIND
THE NARROW ISTHMUS OF THE ASCENDING SOUL
WE MUST RENEW THE SECRET BOND IN THINGS
OUR HEARTS RECALL THE LOST DIVINE IDEA
57
RECONSTITUTE THE PERFECT WORD UNITE
THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA IN ONE SOUND
THEN SHALL THE SPIRIT AND NATURE BE AT ONE
TWO ARE THE ENDS OF THE MYSTERIOUS PLAN
IN THE WIDE SIGNLESS ETHER OF THE SELF
IN THE UNCHANGING SILENCE WHITE AND NUDE
ALOOF RESPLENDENT LIKE GOLD DAZZLING SUNS
VEILED BY THE RAY NO MORTAL EYE CAN BEAR
THE SPIRIT'S BARE AND ABSOLUTE POTENCIES
BURN IN THE SOLITUDE OF THE THOUGHTS OF GOD
A RAPTURE AND A RADIANCE AND A HUSH
DELIVERED FROM THE APPROACH OF WOUNDED HEARTS
DENIED TO THE IDEA THAT LOOKS AT GRIEF
REMOTE FROM THE FORCE THAT CRIES OUT IN ITS PAIN
IN HIS INALIENABLE BLISS THEY LIVE
IMMACULATE IN SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-POWER
CALM THEY REPOSE ON THE ETERNAL WILL
ONLY HIS LAW THEY COUNT AND HIM OBEY
THEY HAVE NO GOAL TO REACH NO AIM TO SERVE
IMPLACABLE IN THEIR TIMELESS PURITY
ALL BARTER OR BRIBE OF WORSHIP THEY REFUSE
UNMOVED BY CRY OF REVOLT AND IGNORANT PRAYER
THEY RECKON NOT OUR VIRTUE AND OUR SIN
THEY BEND NOT TO THE VOICES THAT IMPLORE
THEY HOLD NO TRAFFIC WITH ERROR AND ITS REIGN
THEY ARE GUARDIANS OF THE SILENCE OF THE TRUTH
THEY ARE KEEPERS OF THE IMMUTABLE DECREE
A DEEP SURRENDER IS THEIR SOURCE OF MIGHT
A STILL IDENTITY THEIR WAY TO KNOW
MOTIONLESS IS THEIR ACTION LIKE A SLEEP
AT PEACE REGARDING THE TROUBLE BENEATH THE STARS
DEATHLESS WATCHING THE WORKS OF DEATH AND CHANCE
IMMOBILE SEEING THE MILLENNIUMS PASS
UNTOUCHED WHILE THE LONG MAP OF FATE UNROLLS
THEY LOOK ON OUR STRUGGLE WITH IMPARTIAL EYES
AND YET WITHOUT THEM COSMOS COULD NOT BE
58
IMPERVIOUS TO DESIRE AND DOOM AND HOPE
THEIR STATION OF INVIOLABLE MIGHT
MOVELESS UPHOLDS THE WORLD'S ENORMOUS TASK
ITS IGNORANCE IS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE LIT
ITS YEARNING LASTS BY THEIR INDIFFERENCE
AS THE HEIGHT DRAWS THE LOW EVER TO CLIMB
AS THE BREADTHS DRAW THE SMALL TO ADVENTURE VAST
THEIR ALOOFNESS DRIVES MAN TO SURPASS HIMSELF
OUR PASSION HEAVES TO WED THE ETERNAL'S CALM
OUR DWARF-SEARCH MIND TO MEET THE OMNISCIENT'S LIGHT
OUR HELPLESS HEARTS TO ENSHRINE THE OMNIPOTENT'S FORCE
ACQUIESCING IN THE WISDOM THAT MADE HELL
AND THE HARSH UTILITY OF DEATH AND TEARS
ACQUIESCING IN THE GRADUAL STEPS OF TIME
CARELESS THEY SEEM OF THE GRIEF THAT STINGS THE WORLD'S HEART
CARELESS OF THE PAIN THAT RENDS ITS BODY AND LIFE
ABOVE JOY AND SORROW IS THAT GRANDEUR'S WALK
THEY HAVE NO PORTION IN THE GOOD THAT DIES
MUTE PURE THEY SHARE NOT IN THE EVIL DONE
ELSE MIGHT THEIR STRENGTH BE MARRED AND COULD NOT SAVE
ALIVE TO THE TRUTH THAT DWELLS IN GOD'S EXTREMES
AWAKE TO A MOTION OF ALL-SEEING FORCE
THE SLOW OUTCOME OF THE LONG AMBIGUOUS YEARS
AND THE UNEXPECTED GOOD FROM WOEFUL DEEDS
THE IMMORTAL SEES NOT AS WE VAINLY SEE
HE LOOKS ON HIDDEN ASPECTS AND SCREENED POWERS
HE KNOWS THE LAW AND NATURAL LINE OF THINGS
UNDRIVEN BY A BRIEF LIFE'S WILL TO ACT
UNHARASSED BY THE SPUR OF PITY AND FEAR
HE MAKES NO HASTE TO UNTIE THE COSMIC KNOT
OR THE WORLD'S TORN JARRING HEART TO RECONCILE
IN TIME HE WAITS FOR THE ETERNAL'S HOUR
YET A SPIRITUAL SECRET AID IS THERE
WHILE A TARDY EVOLUTION'S COILS WIND ON
AND NATURE HEWS HER WAY THROUGH ADAMANT
A DIVINE INTERVENTION THRONES ABOVE
59
ALIVE IN A DEAD ROTATING UNIVERSE
WE WHIRL NOT HERE UPON A CASUAL GLOBE
ABANDONED TO A TASK BEYOND OUR FORCE
EVEN THROUGH THE TANGLED ANARCHY CALLED FATE
AND THROUGH THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH AND FALL
AN OUTSTRETCHED HAND IS FELT UPON OUR LIVES
IT IS NEAR US IN UNNUMBERED BODIES AND BIRTHS
IN ITS UNSLACKENING GRASP IT KEEPS FOR US SAFE
THE ONE INEVITABLE SUPREME RESULT
NO WILL CAN TAKE AWAY AND NO DOOM CHANGE
THE CROWN OF CONSCIOUS IMMORTALITY
THE GODHEAD PROMISED TO OUR STRUGGLING SOULS
WHEN FIRST MAN'S HEART DARED DEATH AND SUFFERED LIFE
ONE WHO HAS SHAPED THIS WORLD IS EVER ITS LORD
OUR ERRORS ARE HIS STEPS UPON THE WAY
HE WORKS THROUGH THE FIERCE VICISSITUDES OF OUR LIVES
HE WORKS THROUGH THE HARD BREATH OF BATTLE AND TOIL
HE WORKS THROUGH OUR SINS AND SORROWS AND OUR TEARS
HIS KNOWLEDGE OVERRULES OUR NESCIENCE
WHATEVER THE APPEARANCE WE MUST BEAR
WHATEVER OUR STRONG ILLS AND PRESENT FATE
WHEN NOTHING WE CAN SEE BUT DRIFT AND BALE
A MIGHTY GUIDANCE LEADS US STILL THROUGH ALL
AFTER WE HAVE SERVED THIS GREAT DIVIDED WORLD
GOD'S BLISS AND ONENESS ARE OUR INBORN RIGHT
A DATE IS FIXED IN THE CALENDAR OF THE UNKNOWN
AN ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH SUBLIME
OUR SOUL SHALL JUSTIFY ITS CHEQUERED WALK
ALL WILL COME NEAR THAT NOW IS NAUGHT OR FAR
THESE CALM AND DISTANT MIGHTS SHALL ACT AT LAST
IMMOVABLY READY FOR THEIR DESTINED TASK
THE EVER-WISE COMPASSIONATE BRILLIANCES
AWAIT THE SOUND OF THE INCARNATE'S VOICE
TO LEAP AND BRIDGE THE CHASMS OF IGNORANCE
AND HEAL THE HOLLOW YEARNING GULFS OF LIFE
AND FILL THE ABYSS THAT IS THE UNIVERSE
60
HERE MEANWHILE AT THE SPIRIT'S OPPOSITE POLE
IN THE MYSTERY OF THE DEEPS THAT GOD HAS BUILT
FOR HIS ABODE BELOW THE THINKER'S SIGHT
IN THIS COMPROMISE OF A STARK ABSOLUTE TRUTH
WITH THE LIGHT THAT DWELLS NEAR THE DARK END OF THINGS
IN THIS TRAGI-COMEDY OF DIVINE DISGUISE
THIS LONG FAR SEEKING FOR JOY EVER NEAR
IN THE GRANDIOSE DREAM OF WHICH THE WORLD IS MADE
IN THIS GOLD DOME ON A BLACK DRAGON BASE
THE CONSCIOUS FORCE THAT ACTS IN NATURE'S BREAST
A DARK-ROBED LABOURER IN THE COSMIC SCHEME
CARRYING CLAY IMAGES OF UNBORN GODS
EXECUTRIX OF THE INEVITABLE IDEA
HAMPERED ENVELOPED BY THE HOOPS OF FATE
PATIENT TRUSTEE OF SLOW ETERNAL TIME
ABSOLVES FROM HOUR TO HOUR HER SECRET CHARGE
ALL SHE FORESEES IN MASKED IMPERATIVE DEPTHS
THE DUMB INTENTION OF THE UNCONSCIOUS GULFS
ANSWERS TO A WILL THAT SEES UPON THE HEIGHTS
AND THE EVOLVING WORD'S FIRST SYLLABLE
PONDEROUS BRUTE-SENSED CONTAINS ITS LUMINOUS CLOSE
PRIVY TO A SUMMIT VICTORY'S VAST DESCENT
AND THE PORTENT OF THE SOUL'S IMMENSE UPRISE
ALL HERE WHERE EACH THING SEEMS ITS LONELY SELF
ARE FIGURES OF THE SOLE TRANSCENDENT ONE
ONLY BY HIM THEY ARE HIS BREATH IS THEIR LIFE
AN UNSEEN PRESENCE MOULDS THE OBLIVIOUS CLAY
A PLAYMATE IN THE MIGHTY MOTHER'S GAME
ONE CAME UPON THE DUBIOUS WHIRLING GLOBE
TO HIDE FROM HER PURSUIT IN FORCE AND FORM
A SECRET SPIRIT IN THE INCONSCIENT'S SLEEP
A SHAPELESS ENERGY A VOICELESS WORD
HE WAS HERE BEFORE THE ELEMENTS COULD EMERGE
BEFORE THERE WAS LIGHT OF MIND OR LIFE COULD BREATHE
ACCOMPLICE OF HER COSMIC HUGE PRETENCE
61
HIS SEMBLANCES HE TURNS TO REAL SHAPES
AND MAKES THE SYMBOL EQUAL WITH THE TRUTH
HE GIVES TO HIS TIMELESS THOUGHTS A FORM IN TIME
HE IS THE SUBSTANCE HE THE SELF OF THINGS
SHE HAS FORGED FROM HIM HER WORKS OF SKILL AND MIGHT
SHE WRAPS HIM IN THE MAGIC OF HER MOODS
AND MAKES OF HIS MYRIAD TRUTHS HER COUNTLESS DREAMS
THE MASTER OF BEING HAS COME DOWN TO HER
AN IMMORTAL CHILD BORN IN THE FUGITIVE YEARS
IN OBJECTS WROUGHT IN THE PERSONS SHE CONCEIVES
DREAMING SHE CHASES HER IDEA OF HIM
AND CATCHES HERE A LOOK AND THERE A GEST
EVER HE REPEATS IN THEM HIS CEASELESS BIRTHS
HE IS THE MAKER AND THE WORLD HE MADE
HE IS THE VISION AND HE IS THE SEER
HE IS HIMSELF THE ACTOR AND THE ACT
HE IS HIMSELF THE KNOWER AND THE KNOWN
HE IS HIMSELF THE DREAMER AND THE DREAM
THERE ARE TWO WHO ARE ONE AND PLAY IN MANY WORLDS
IN KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE THEY HAVE SPOKEN AND MET
AND LIGHT AND DARKNESS ARE THEIR EYES' INTERCHANGE
OUR PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE THEIR WRESTLE AND EMBRACE
OUR DEEDS OUR HOPES ARE INTIMATE TO THEIR TALE
THEY ARE MARRIED SECRETLY IN OUR THOUGHT AND LIFE
THE UNIVERSE IS AN ENDLESS MASQUERADE
FOR NOTHING HERE IS UTTERLY WHAT IT SEEMS
IT IS A DREAM-FACT VISION OF A TRUTH
WHICH BUT FOR THE DREAM WOULD NOT BE WHOLLY TRUE
A PHENOMENON STANDS OUT SIGNIFICANT
AGAINST DIM BACKGROUNDS OF ETERNITY
WE ACCEPT ITS FACE AND PASS BY ALL IT MEANS
A PART IS SEEN WE TAKE IT FOR THE WHOLE
THUS HAVE THEY MADE THEIR PLAY WITH US FOR ROLES
AUTHOR AND ACTOR WITH HIMSELF AS SCENE
HE MOVES THERE AS THE SOUL AS NATURE SHE
HERE ON THE EARTH WHERE WE MUST FILL OUR PARTS
62
WE KNOW NOT HOW SHALL RUN THE DRAMA'S COURSE
OUR UTTERED SENTENCES VEIL IN THEIR THOUGHT
HER MIGHTY PLAN SHE HOLDS BACK FROM OUR SIGHT
SHE HAS CONCEALED HER GLORY AND HER BLISS
AND DISGUISED THE LOVE AND WISDOM IN HER HEART
OF ALL THE MARVEL AND BEAUTY THAT ARE HERS
ONLY A DARKENED LITTLE WE CAN FEEL
HE TOO WEARS A DIMINISHED GODHEAD HERE
HE HAS FORSAKEN HIS OMNIPOTENCE
HIS CALM HE HAS FOREGONE AND INFINITY
HE KNOWS HER ONLY HE HAS FORGOTTEN HIMSELF
TO HER HE ABANDONS ALL TO MAKE HER GREAT
HE HOPES IN HER TO FIND HIMSELF ANEW
INCARNATE WEDDING HIS INFINITY'S PEACE
TO HER CREATIVE PASSION'S ECSTASY
ALTHOUGH POSSESSOR OF THE EARTH AND HEAVENS
HE LEAVES TO HER THE COSMIC MANAGEMENT
AND WATCHES ALL THE WITNESS OF HER SCENE
A SUPERNUMERARY ON HER STAGE
HE SPEAKS NO WORDS OR HIDES BEHIND THE WINGS
HE TAKES BIRTH IN HER WORLD WAITS ON HER WILL
DIVINES HER ENIGMATIC GESTURE'S SENSE
THE FLUCTUATING CHANCE TURNS OF HER MOOD
WORKS OUT HER MEANINGS SHE SEEMS NOT TO KNOW
AND SERVES HER SECRET PURPOSE IN LONG TIME
AS ONE TOO GREAT FOR HIM HE WORSHIPS HER
HE ADORES HER AS HIS REGENT OF DESIRE
HE YIELDS TO HER AS THE MOVER OF HIS WILL
HE BURNS THE INCENSE OF HIS NIGHTS AND DAYS
OFFERING HIS LIFE A SPLENDOUR OF SACRIFICE
A RAPT SOLICITOR FOR HER LOVE AND GRACE
HIS BLISS IN HER TO HIM IS HIS WHOLE WORLD
HE GROWS THROUGH HER IN ALL HIS BEING'S POWERS
HE READS BY HER GOD'S HIDDEN AIM IN THINGS
OR A COURTIER IN HER COUNTLESS RETINUE
CONTENT TO BE WITH HER AND FEEL HER NEAR
63
HE MAKES THE MOST OF THE LITTLE THAT SHE GIVES
AND ALL SHE DOES DRAPES WITH HIS OWN DELIGHT
A GLANCE CAN MAKE HIS WHOLE DAY WONDERFUL
A WORD FROM HER LIPS WITH HAPPINESS WINGS THE HOURS
HE LEANS ON HER FOR ALL HE DOES AND IS
HE BUILDS ON HER LARGESSES HIS PROUD FORTUNATE DAYS
AND TRAILS HIS PEACOCK-PLUMAGED JOY OF LIFE
AND SUNS IN THE GLORY OF HER PASSING SMILE
IN A THOUSAND WAYS HE SERVES HER ROYAL NEEDS
HE MAKES THE HOURS PIVOT AROUND HER WILL
MAKES ALL REFLECT HER WHIMS ALL IS THEIR PLAY
THIS WHOLE WIDE WORLD IS ONLY HE AND SHE
THIS IS THE KNOT THAT TIES TOGETHER THE STARS
THE TWO WHO ARE ONE ARE THE SECRET OF ALL POWER
THE TWO WHO ARE ONE ARE THE MIGHT AND RIGHT IN THINGS
HIS SOUL SILENT SUPPORTS THE WORLD AND HER
HIS ACTS ARE HER COMMANDMENT'S REGISTERS
HAPPY INERT HE LIES BENEATH HER FEET
HIS BREAST HE OFFERS FOR HER COSMIC DANCE
OF WHICH OUR LIVES ARE THE QUIVERING THEATRE
AND NONE COULD BEAR BUT FOR HIS STRENGTH WITHIN
YET NONE WOULD LEAVE BECAUSE OF HIS DELIGHT
HIS WORKS HIS THOUGHTS HAVE BEEN DEVISED BY HER
HIS BEING IS A MIRROR VAST OF HERS
ACTIVE INSPIRED BY HER HE SPEAKS AND MOVES
HIS DEEDS OBEY HER HEART'S UNSPOKEN DEMANDS
PASSIVE HE BEARS THE IMPACTS OF THE WORLD
AS IF HER TOUCHES SHAPING HIS SOUL AND LIFE
HIS JOURNEY THROUGH THE DAYS IS HER SUN-MARCH
HE RUNS UPON HER ROADS HERS IS HIS COURSE
A WITNESS AND STUDENT OF HER JOY AND DOLE
A PARTNER IN HER EVIL AND HER GOOD
HE HAS CONSENTED TO HER PASSIONATE WAYS
HE IS DRIVEN BY HER SWEET AND DREADFUL FORCE
HIS SANCTIONING NAME INITIALS ALL HER WORKS
64
HIS SILENCE IS HIS SIGNATURE TO HER DEEDS
IN THE EXECUTION OF HER DRAMA'S SCHEME
IN HER FANCIES OF THE MOMENT AND ITS MOOD
IN THE MARCH OF THIS OBVIOUS ORDINARY WORLD
WHERE ALL IS DEEP AND STRANGE TO THE EYES THAT SEE
AND NATURE'S COMMON FORMS ARE MARVEL-WEFTS
SHE THROUGH HIS WITNESS SIGHT AND MOTION OF MIGHT
UNROLLS THE MATERIAL OF HER COSMIC ACT
HER HAPPENINGS THAT EXALT AND SMITE THE SOUL
HER FORCE THAT MOVES HER POWERS THAT SAVE AND SLAY
HER WORD THAT IN THE SILENCE SPEAKS TO OUR HEARTS
HER SILENCE THAT TRANSCENDS THE SUMMIT WORD
HER HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS TO WHICH OUR SPIRIT MOVES
HER EVENTS THAT WEAVE THE TEXTURE OF OUR LIVES
AND ALL BY WHICH WE FIND OR LOSE OURSELVES
THINGS SWEET AND BITTER MAGNIFICENT AND MEAN
THINGS TERRIBLE AND BEAUTIFUL AND DIVINE
HER EMPIRE IN THE COSMOS SHE HAS BUILT
HE IS GOVERNED BY HER SUBTLE AND MIGHTY LAWS
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS A BABE UPON HER KNEES
HIS BEING A FIELD OF HER VAST EXPERIMENT
HER ENDLESS SPACE IS THE PLAYGROUND OF HIS THOUGHTS
SHE BINDS TO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHAPES OF TIME
AND THE CREATIVE ERROR OF LIMITING MIND
AND CHANCE THAT WEARS THE RIGID FACE OF FATE
AND HER SPORT OF DEATH AND PAIN AND NESCIENCE
HIS CHANGED AND STRUGGLING IMMORTALITY
HIS SOUL IS A SUBTLE ATOM IN A MASS
HIS SUBSTANCE A MATERIAL FOR HER WORKS
HIS SPIRIT SURVIVES AMID THE DEATH OF THINGS
HE CLIMBS TO ETERNITY THROUGH BEING'S GAPS
HE IS CARRIED BY HER FROM NIGHT TO DEATHLESS LIGHT
THIS GRAND SURRENDER IS HIS FREE-WILL'S GIFT
HIS PURE TRANSCENDENT FORCE SUBMITS TO HERS
IN THE MYSTERY OF HER COSMIC IGNORANCE
IN THE INSOLUBLE RIDDLE OF HER PLAY
65
A CREATURE MADE OF PERISHABLE STUFF
IN THE PATTERN SHE HAS SET FOR HIM HE MOVES
HE THINKS WITH HER THOUGHTS WITH HER TROUBLE HIS BOSOM HEAVES
HE SEEMS THE THING THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HIM SEEM
HE IS WHATEVER HER ARTIST WILL CAN MAKE
ALTHOUGH SHE DRIVES HIM ON HER FANCY'S ROADS
AT PLAY WITH HIM AS WITH HER CHILD OR SLAVE
TO FREEDOM AND THE ETERNAL'S MASTERY
AND IMMORTALITY'S STAND ABOVE THE WORLD
SHE MOVES HER SEEMING PUPPET OF AN HOUR
EVEN IN HIS MORTAL SESSION IN BODY'S HOUSE
AN AIMLESS TRAVELLER BETWEEN BIRTH AND DEATH
EPHEMERAL DREAMING OF IMMORTALITY
TO REIGN SHE SPURS HIM HE TAKES UP HER POWERS
HE HAS HARNESSED HER TO THE YOKE OF HER OWN LAW
HIS FACE OF HUMAN THOUGHT PUTS ON A CROWN
HELD IN HER LEASH BOUND TO HER VEILED CAPRICE
HE STUDIES HER WAYS IF SO HE MAY PREVAIL
EVEN FOR AN HOUR AND SHE WORK OUT HIS WILL
HE MAKES OF HER HIS MOMENT PASSION'S SERF
TO OBEY SHE FEIGNS SHE FOLLOWS HER CREATURE'S LEAD
FOR HIM SHE WAS MADE LIVES ONLY FOR HIS USE
BUT CONQUERING HER THEN IS HE MOST HER SLAVE
HE IS HER DEPENDENT ALL HIS MEANS ARE HERS
NOTHING WITHOUT HER HE CAN SHE RULES HIM STILL
AT LAST HE WAKES TO A MEMORY OF SELF
HE SEES WITHIN THE FACE OF DEITY
THE GODHEAD BREAKS OUT THROUGH THE HUMAN MOULD
HER HIGHEST HEIGHTS SHE UNMASKS AND IS HIS MATE
TILL THEN HE IS A PLAYTHING IN HER GAME
HER SEEMING REGENT YET HER FANCY'S TOY
A LIVING ROBOT MOVED BY HER ENERGY'S SPRINGS
HE ACTS AS IN THE MOVEMENTS OF A DREAM
AN AUTOMATON STEPPING IN THE GROOVES OF FATE
HE STUMBLES ON DRIVEN BY HER WHIP OF FORCE
HIS THOUGHT LABOURS A BULLOCK IN TIME'S FIELDS
66
HIS WILL HE THINKS HIS OWN IS SHAPED IN HER FORGE
OBEDIENT TO WORLD-NATURE'S DUMB CONTROL
DRIVEN BY HIS OWN FORMIDABLE POWER
HIS CHOSEN PARTNER IN A TITAN GAME
HER WILL HE HAS MADE THE MASTER OF HIS FATE
HER WHIM THE DISPENSER OF HIS PLEASURE AND PAIN
HE HAS SOLD HIMSELF INTO HER REGAL POWER
FOR ANY BLOW OR BOON THAT SHE MAY CHOOSE
EVEN IN WHAT IS SUFFERING TO OUR SENSE
HE FEELS THE SWEETNESS OF HER MASTERING TOUCH
IN ALL EXPERIENCE MEETS HER BLISSFUL HANDS
ON HIS HEART HE BEARS THE HAPPINESS OF HER TREAD
AND THE SURPRISE OF HER ARRIVAL'S JOY
IN EACH EVENT AND EVERY MOMENT'S CHANCE
ALL SHE CAN DO IS MARVELLOUS IN HIS SIGHT
HE REVELS IN HER A SWIMMER IN HER SEA
A TIRELESS AMATEUR OF HER WORLD-DELIGHT
HE REJOICES IN HER EVERY THOUGHT AND ACT
AND GIVES CONSENT TO ALL THAT SHE CAN WISH
WHATEVER SHE DESIRES HE WILLS TO BE
THE SPIRIT THE INNUMERABLE ONE
HE HAS LEFT BEHIND HIS LONE ETERNITY
HE IS AN ENDLESS BIRTH IN ENDLESS TIME
HER FINITE'S MULTITUDE IN AN INFINITE SPACE
THE MASTER OF EXISTENCE LURKS IN US
AND PLAYS AT HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH HIS OWN FORCE
IN NATURE'S INSTRUMENT LOITERS SECRET GOD
THE IMMANENT LIVES IN MAN AS IN HIS HOUSE
HE HAS MADE THE UNIVERSE HIS PASTIME'S FIELD
A VAST GYMNASIUM OF HIS WORKS OF MIGHT
ALL-KNOWING HE ACCEPTS OUR DARKENED STATE
DIVINE WEARS SHAPES OF ANIMAL OR MAN
ETERNAL HE ASSENTS TO FATE AND TIME
IMMORTAL DALLIES WITH MORTALITY
THE ALL-CONSCIOUS VENTURED INTO IGNORANCE
67
THE ALL-BLISSFUL BORE TO BE INSENSIBLE
INCARNATE IN A WORLD OF STRIFE AND PAIN
HE PUTS ON JOY AND SORROW LIKE A ROBE
AND DRINKS EXPERIENCE LIKE A STRENGTHENING WINE
HE WHOSE TRANSCENDENCE RULES THE PREGNANT VASTS
PRESCIENT NOW DWELLS IN OUR SUBLIMINAL DEPTHS
A LUMINOUS INDIVIDUAL POWER ALONE
THE ABSOLUTE THE PERFECT THE ALONE
HAS CALLED OUT OF THE SILENCE HIS MUTE FORCE
WHERE SHE LAY IN THE FEATURELESS AND FORMLESS HUSH
GUARDING FROM TIME BY HER IMMOBILE SLEEP
THE INEFFABLE PUISSANCE OF HIS SOLITUDE
THE ABSOLUTE THE PERFECT THE ALONE
HAS ENTERED WITH HIS SILENCE INTO SPACE
HE HAS FASHIONED THESE COUNTLESS PERSONS OF ONE SELF
HE HAS BUILT A MILLION FIGURES OF HIS POWER
HE LIVES IN ALL WHO LIVED IN HIS VAST ALONE
SPACE IS HIMSELF AND TIME IS ONLY HE
THE ABSOLUTE THE PERFECT THE IMMUNE
ONE WHO IS IN US AS OUR SECRET SELF
OUR MASK OF IMPERFECTION HAS ASSUMED
HE HAS MADE THIS TENEMENT OF FLESH HIS OWN
HIS IMAGE IN THE HUMAN MEASURE CAST
THAT TO HIS DIVINE MEASURE WE MIGHT RISE
THEN IN A FIGURE OF DIVINITY
THE MAKER SHALL RECAST US AND IMPOSE
A PLAN OF GODHEAD ON THE MORTAL'S MOULD
LIFTING OUR FINITE MINDS TO HIS INFINITE
TOUCHING THE MOMENT WITH ETERNITY
THIS TRANSFIGURATION IS EARTH'S DUE TO HEAVEN
A MUTUAL DEBT BINDS MAN TO THE SUPREME
HIS NATURE WE MUST PUT ON AS HE PUT OURS
WE ARE SONS OF GOD AND MUST BE EVEN AS HE
HIS HUMAN PORTION WE MUST GROW DIVINE
OUR LIFE IS A PARADOX WITH GOD FOR KEY
68
BUT MEANWHILE ALL IS A SHADOW CAST BY A DREAM
AND TO THE MUSING AND IMMOBILE SPIRIT
LIFE AND HIMSELF DON THE ASPECT OF A MYTH
THE BURDEN OF A LONG UNMEANING TALE
FOR THE KEY IS HID AND BY THE INCONSCIENT KEPT
THE SECRET GOD BENEATH THE THRESHOLD DWELLS
IN A BODY OBSCURING THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT
A NAMELESS RESIDENT VESTING UNSEEN POWERS
WITH MATTER'S SHAPES AND MOTIVES BEYOND THOUGHT
AND THE HAZARD OF AN UNGUESSED CONSEQUENCE
AN OMNIPOTENT INDISCERNIBLE INFLUENCE
HE SITS UNFELT BY THE FORM IN WHICH HE LIVES
AND VEILS HIS KNOWLEDGE BY THE GROPING MIND
A WANDERER IN A WORLD HIS THOUGHTS HAVE MADE
HE TURNS IN A CHIAROSCURO OF ERROR AND TRUTH
TO FIND A WISDOM THAT ON HIGH IS HIS
AS ONE FORGETTING HE SEARCHES FOR HIMSELF
AS IF HE HAD LOST AN INNER LIGHT HE SEEKS
AS A SOJOURNER LINGERING AMID ALIEN SCENES
HE JOURNEYS TO A HOME HE KNOWS NO MORE
HIS OWN SELF'S TRUTH HE SEEKS WHO IS THE TRUTH
HE IS THE PLAYER WHO BECAME THE PLAY
HE IS THE THINKER WHO BECAME THE THOUGHT
HE IS THE MANY WHO WAS THE SILENT ONE
IN THE SYMBOL FIGURES OF THE COSMIC FORCE
AND IN HER LIVING AND INANIMATE SIGNS
AND IN HER COMPLEX TRACERY OF EVENTS
HE EXPLORES THE CEASELESS MIRACLE OF HIMSELF
TILL THE THOUSANDFOLD ENIGMA HAS BEEN SOLVED
IN THE SINGLE LIGHT OF AN ALL-WITNESSING SOUL
THIS WAS HIS COMPACT WITH HIS MIGHTY MATE
FOR LOVE OF HER AND JOINED TO HER FOR EVER
TO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF TIME'S ETERNITY
AMID MAGIC DRAMAS OF HER SUDDEN MOODS
AND THE SURPRISES OF HER MASKED IDEA
AND THE VICISSITUDES OF HER VAST CAPRICE
69
TWO SEEM HIS GOALS YET EVER ARE THEY ONE
AND GAZE AT EACH OTHER OVER BOURNELESS TIME
SPIRIT AND MATTER ARE THEIR END AND SOURCE
A SEEKER OF HIDDEN MEANINGS IN LIFE'S FORMS
OF THE GREAT MOTHER'S WIDE UNCHARTED WILL
AND THE RUDE ENIGMA OF HER TERRESTRIAL WAYS
HE IS THE EXPLORER AND THE MARINER
ON A SECRET INNER OCEAN WITHOUT BOURNE
HE IS THE ADVENTURER AND COSMOLOGIST
OF A MAGIC EARTH'S OBSCURE GEOGRAPHY
IN HER MATERIAL ORDER'S FIXED DESIGN
WHERE ALL SEEMS SURE AND EVEN WHEN CHANGED THE SAME
EVEN THOUGH THE END IS LEFT FOR EVER UNKNOWN
AND EVER UNSTABLE IS LIFE'S SHIFTING FLOW
HIS PATHS ARE FOUND FOR HIM BY SILENT FATE
AS STATIONS IN THE AGES' WELTERING FLOOD
FIRM LANDS APPEAR THAT TEMPT AND STAY AWHILE
THEN NEW HORIZONS LURE THE MIND'S ADVANCE
THERE COMES NO CLOSE TO THE FINITE'S BOUNDLESSNESS
THERE IS NO LAST CERTITUDE IN WHICH THOUGHT CAN PAUSE
AND NO TERMINUS TO THE SOUL'S EXPERIENCE
A LIMIT A FARNESS NEVER WHOLLY REACHED
AN UNATTAINED PERFECTION CALLS TO HIM
FROM DISTANT BOUNDARIES IN THE UNSEEN
A LONG BEGINNING ONLY HAS BEEN MADE
THIS IS THE SAILOR ON THE FLOW OF TIME
THIS IS WORLD-MATTER'S SLOW DISCOVERER
WHO LAUNCHED INTO THIS SMALL CORPOREAL BIRTH
HAS LEARNED HIS CRAFT IN TINY BAYS OF SELF
BUT DARES AT LAST UNPLUMBED INFINITUDES
A VOYAGER UPON ETERNITY'S SEAS
IN HIS WORLD-ADVENTURE'S CRUDE INITIAL START
BEHOLD HIM IGNORANT OF HIS GODHEAD'S FORCE
TIMID INITIATE OF ITS VAST DESIGN
AN EXPERT CAPTAIN OF A FRAGILE CRAFT
70
A TRAFFICKER IN SMALL IMPERMANENT WARES
AT FIRST HE HUGS THE SHORE AND SHUNS THE BREADTHS
DARES NOT TO AFFRONT THE FAR-OFF PERILOUS MAIN
HE IN A PETTY COASTAL TRAFFIC PLIES
HIS PAY DOLED OUT FROM PORT TO NEIGHBOUR PORT
CONTENT WITH HIS SAFE ROUND'S UNCHANGING COURSE
HE HAZARDS NOT THE NEW AND THE UNSEEN
BUT NOW HE HEARS THE SOUND OF LARGER SEAS
A WIDENING WORLD CALLS HIM TO DISTANT SCENES
AND JOURNEYINGS IN A LARGER VISION'S ARC
AND PEOPLES UNKNOWN AND STILL UNVISITED SHORES
ON A COMMISSIONED KEEL HIS MERCHANT HULL
SERVES THE WORLD'S COMMERCE IN THE RICHES OF TIME
SEVERING THE FOAM OF A GREAT LAND-LOCKED SEA
TO REACH UNKNOWN HARBOUR LIGHTS IN DISTANT CLIMES
AND OPEN MARKETS FOR LIFE'S OPULENT ARTS
RICH BALES CARVED STATUETTES HUED CANVASES
AND JEWELLED TOYS BROUGHT FOR AN INFANT'S PLAY
AND PERISHABLE PRODUCTS OF HARD TOIL
AND TRANSIENT SPLENDOURS WON AND LOST BY THE DAYS
OR PASSING THROUGH A GATE OF PILLAR-ROCKS
VENTURING NOT YET TO CROSS OCEANS UNNAMED
AND JOURNEY INTO A DREAM OF DISTANCES
HE TRAVELS CLOSE TO UNFAMILIAR COASTS
AND FINDS NEW HAVEN IN STORM-TROUBLED ISLES
OR GUIDED BY A SURE COMPASS IN HIS THOUGHT
HE PLUNGES THROUGH A BRIGHT HAZE THAT HIDES THE STARS
STEERING ON THE TRADE-ROUTES OF IGNORANCE
HIS PROW PUSHES TOWARDS UNDISCOVERED SHORES
HE CHANCES ON UNIMAGINED CONTINENTS
A SEEKER OF THE ISLANDS OF THE BLEST
HE LEAVES THE LAST LANDS CROSSES THE ULTIMATE SEAS
HE TURNS TO ETERNAL THINGS HIS SYMBOL QUEST
LIFE CHANGES FOR HIM ITS TIME-CONSTRUCTED SCENES
ITS IMAGES VEILING INFINITY
EARTH'S BORDERS RECEDE AND THE TERRESTRIAL AIR
71
HANGS ROUND HIM NO LONGER ITS TRANSLUCENT VEIL
HE HAS CROSSED THE LIMIT OF MORTAL THOUGHT AND HOPE
HE HAS REACHED THE WORLD'S END AND STARES BEYOND
THE EYES OF MORTAL BODY PLUNGE THEIR GAZE
INTO EYES THAT LOOK UPON ETERNITY
A GREATER WORLD TIME'S TRAVELLER MUST EXPLORE
AT LAST HE HEARS A CHANTING ON THE HEIGHTS
AND THE FAR SPEAKS AND THE UNKNOWN GROWS NEAR
HE CROSSES THE BOUNDARIES OF THE UNSEEN
AND PASSES OVER THE EDGE OF MORTAL SIGHT
TO A NEW VISION OF HIMSELF AND THINGS
HE IS A SPIRIT IN AN UNFINISHED WORLD
THAT KNOWS HIM NOT AND CANNOT KNOW ITSELF
THE SURFACE SYMBOL OF HIS GOALLESS QUEST
TAKES DEEPER MEANINGS TO HIS INNER VIEW
HIS IS A SEARCH OF DARKNESS FOR THE LIGHT
OF MORTAL LIFE FOR IMMORTALITY
IN THE VESSEL OF AN EARTHLY EMBODIMENT
OVER THE NARROW RAILS OF LIMITING SENSE
HE LOOKS OUT ON THE MAGIC WAVES OF TIME
WHERE MIND LIKE A MOON ILLUMINES THE WORLD'S DARK
THERE IS LIMNED EVER RETREATING FROM THE EYES
AS IF IN A TENUOUS MISTY DREAM-LIGHT DRAWN
THE OUTLINE OF A DIM MYSTERIOUS SHORE
A SAILOR ON THE INCONSCIENT'S FATHOMLESS SEA
HE VOYAGES THROUGH A STARRY WORLD OF THOUGHT
ON MATTER'S DECK TO A SPIRITUAL SUN
ACROSS THE NOISE AND MULTITUDINOUS CRY
ACROSS THE RAPT UNKNOWABLE SILENCES
THROUGH A STRANGE MID-WORLD UNDER SUPERNAL SKIES
BEYOND EARTH'S LONGITUDES AND LATITUDES
HIS GOAL IS FIXED OUTSIDE ALL PRESENT MAPS
BUT NONE LEARNS WHITHER THROUGH THE UNKNOWN HE SAILS
OR WHAT SECRET MISSION THE GREAT MOTHER GAVE
IN THE HIDDEN STRENGTH OF HER OMNIPOTENT WILL
DRIVEN BY HER BREATH ACROSS LIFE'S TOSSING DEEP
72
THROUGH THE THUNDER'S ROAR AND THROUGH THE WINDLESS HUSH
THROUGH FOG AND MIST WHERE NOTHING MORE IS SEEN
HE CARRIES HER SEALED ORDERS IN HIS BREAST
LATE WILL HE KNOW OPENING THE MYSTIC SCRIPT
WHETHER TO A BLANK PORT IN THE UNSEEN
HE GOES OR ARMED WITH HER FIAT TO DISCOVER
A NEW MIND AND BODY IN THE CITY OF GOD
AND ENSHRINE THE IMMORTAL IN HIS GLORY'S HOUSE
AND MAKE THE FINITE ONE WITH INFINITY
ACROSS THE SALT WASTE OF THE ENDLESS YEARS
HER OCEAN WINDS IMPEL HIS ERRANT BOAT
THE COSMIC WATERS PLASHING AS HE GOES
A RUMOUR AROUND HIM AND DANGER AND A CALL
ALWAYS HE FOLLOWS IN HER FORCE'S WAKE
HE SAILS THROUGH LIFE AND DEATH AND OTHER LIFE
HE TRAVELS ON THROUGH WAKING AND THROUGH SLEEP
A POWER IS ON HIM FROM HER OCCULT FORCE
THAT TIES HIM TO HIS OWN CREATION'S FATE
AND NEVER CAN THE MIGHTY TRAVELLER REST
AND NEVER CAN THE MYSTIC VOYAGE CEASE
TILL THE NESCIENT DUSK IS LIFTED FROM MAN'S SOUL
AND THE MORNS OF GOD HAVE OVERTAKEN HIS NIGHT
AS LONG AS NATURE LASTS HE TOO IS THERE
FOR THIS IS SURE THAT HE AND SHE ARE ONE
EVEN WHEN HE SLEEPS HE KEEPS HER ON HIS BREAST
WHOEVER LEAVES HER HE WILL NOT DEPART
TO REPOSE WITHOUT HER IN THE UNKNOWABLE
THERE IS A TRUTH TO KNOW A WORK TO DO
HER PLAY IS REAL A MYSTERY HE FULFILS
THERE IS A PLAN IN THE MOTHER'S DEEP WORLD-WHIM
A PURPOSE IN HER VAST AND RANDOM GAME
THIS EVER SHE MEANT SINCE THE FIRST DAWN OF LIFE
THIS CONSTANT WILL SHE COVERED WITH HER SPORT
TO EVOKE A PERSON IN THE IMPERSONAL VOID
WITH THE TRUTH-LIGHT STRIKE EARTH'S MASSIVE ROOTS OF TRANCE
WAKE A DUMB SELF IN THE INCONSCIENT DEPTHS
73
AND RAISE A LOST POWER FROM ITS PYTHON SLEEP
THAT THE EYES OF THE TIMELESS MIGHT LOOK OUT FROM TIME
AND THE WORLD MANIFEST THE UNVEILED DIVINE
FOR THIS HE LEFT HIS WHITE INFINITY
AND LAID ON THE SPIRIT THE BURDEN OF THE FLESH
THAT GODHEAD'S SEED MIGHT FLOWER IN MINDLESS SPACE
74
THIS KNOWLEDGE FIRST HE HAD OF TIME-BORN MEN
ADMITTED THROUGH A CURTAIN OF BRIGHT MIND
THAT HANGS BETWEEN OUR THOUGHTS AND ABSOLUTE SIGHT
HE FOUND THE OCCULT CAVE THE MYSTIC DOOR
NEAR TO THE WELL OF VISION IN THE SOUL
AND ENTERED WHERE THE WINGS OF GLORY BROOD
IN THE SILENT SPACE WHERE ALL IS FOR EVER KNOWN
INDIFFERENT TO DOUBT AND TO BELIEF
AVID OF THE NAKED REAL'S SINGLE SHOCK
HE SHORE THE CORD OF MIND THAT TIES THE EARTH-HEART
AND CAST AWAY THE YOKE OF MATTER'S LAW
THE BODY'S RULES BOUND NOT THE SPIRIT'S POWERS
WHEN LIFE HAD STOPPED ITS BEATS DEATH BROKE NOT IN
HE DARED TO LIVE WHEN BREATH AND THOUGHT WERE STILL
THUS COULD HE STEP INTO THAT MAGIC PLACE
WHICH FEW CAN EVEN GLIMPSE WITH HURRIED GLANCE
LIFTED FOR A MOMENT FROM MIND'S LABOURED WORKS
AND THE POVERTY OF NATURE'S EARTHLY SIGHT
ALL THAT THE GODS HAVE LEARNED IS THERE SELF-KNOWN
THERE IN A HIDDEN CHAMBER CLOSED AND MUTE
ARE KEPT THE RECORD GRAPHS OF THE COSMIC SCRIBE
AND THERE THE TABLES OF THE SACRED LAW
THERE IS THE BOOK OF BEING'S INDEX PAGE
THE TEXT AND GLOSSARY OF THE VEDIC TRUTH
ARE THERE THE RHYTHMS AND METRES OF THE STARS
SIGNIFICANT OF THE MOVEMENTS OF OUR FATE
THE SYMBOL POWERS OF NUMBER AND OF FORM
AND THE SECRET CODE OF THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
AND NATURE'S CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE SOUL
ARE WRITTEN IN THE MYSTIC HEART OF LIFE
75
IN THE GLOW OF THE SPIRIT'S ROOM OF MEMORIES
HE COULD RECOVER THE LUMINOUS MARGINAL NOTES
DOTTING WITH LIGHT THE CRABBED AMBIGUOUS SCROLL
RESCUE THE PREAMBLE AND THE SAVING CLAUSE
OF THE DARK AGREEMENT BY WHICH ALL IS RULED
THAT RISES FROM MATERIAL NATURE'S SLEEP
TO CLOTHE THE EVERLASTING IN NEW SHAPES
HE COULD RE-READ NOW AND INTERPRET NEW
ITS STRANGE SYMBOL LETTERS SCATTERED ABSTRUSE SIGNS
RESOLVE ITS ORACLE AND ITS PARADOX
ITS RIDDLING PHRASES AND ITS BLINDFOLD TERMS
THE DEEP OXYMORON OF ITS TRUTH'S REPLIQUES
AND RECOGNISE AS A JUST NECESSITY
ITS HARD CONDITIONS FOR THE MIGHTY WORK
NATURE'S IMPOSSIBLE HERCULEAN TOIL
ONLY HER WARLOCK-WISECRAFT COULD ENFORCE
ITS LAW OF THE OPPOSITION OF THE GODS
ITS LIST OF INSEPARABLE CONTRARIES
THE DUMB GREAT MOTHER IN HER COSMIC TRANCE
EXPLOITING FOR CREATION'S JOY AND PAIN
INFINITY'S SANCTION TO THE BIRTH OF FORM
ACCEPTS INDOMITABLY TO EXECUTE
THE WILL TO KNOW IN AN INCONSCIENT WORLD
THE WILL TO LIVE UNDER A REIGN OF DEATH
THE THIRST FOR RAPTURE IN A HEART OF FLESH
AND WORKS OUT THROUGH THE APPEARANCE OF A SOUL
BY A MIRACULOUS BIRTH IN PLASM AND GAS
THE MYSTERY OF GOD'S COVENANT WITH THE NIGHT
ONCE MORE WAS HEARD IN THE STILL COSMIC MIND
THE ETERNAL'S PROMISE TO HIS LABOURING FORCE
INDUCING THE WORLD-PASSION TO BEGIN
THE CRY OF BIRTH INTO MORTALITY
AND THE OPENING VERSE OF THE TRAGEDY OF TIME
OUT OF THE DEPTHS THE WORLD'S BURIED SECRET ROSE
HE READ THE ORIGINAL UKASE KEPT BACK
IN THE LOCKED ARCHIVES OF THE SPIRIT'S CRYPT
76
AND SAW THE SIGNATURE AND FIERY SEAL
OF WISDOM ON THE DIM POWER'S HOODED WORK
WHO BUILDS IN IGNORANCE THE STEPS OF LIGHT
A SLEEPING DEITY OPENED DEATHLESS EYES
HE SAW THE UNSHAPED THOUGHT IN SOULLESS FORMS
KNEW MATTER PREGNANT WITH SPIRITUAL SENSE
MIND DARE THE STUDY OF THE UNKNOWABLE
LIFE ITS GESTATION OF THE GOLDEN CHILD
IN THE LIGHT FLOODING THOUGHT'S BLANK VACANCY
INTERPRETING THE UNIVERSE BY SOUL SIGNS
HE READ FROM WITHIN THE TEXT OF THE WITHOUT
THE RIDDLE GREW PLAIN AND LOST ITS CATCH OBSCURE
A LARGER LUSTRE LIT THE MIGHTY PAGE
A PURPOSE MINGLED WITH THE WHIMS OF TIME
A MEANING MET THE STUMBLING PACE OF CHANCE
AND FATE REVEALED A CHAIN OF SEEING WILL
A CONSCIOUS WIDENESS FILLED THE OLD DUMB SPACE
IN THE VOID HE SAW THRONED THE OMNISCIENCE SUPREME
A WILL A HOPE IMMENSE NOW SEIZED HIS HEART
AND TO DISCERN THE SUPERHUMAN'S FORM
HE RAISED HIS EYES TO UNSEEN SPIRITUAL HEIGHTS
ASPIRING TO BRING DOWN A GREATER WORLD
THE GLORY HE HAD GLIMPSED MUST BE HIS HOME
A BRIGHTER HEAVENLIER SUN MUST SOON ILLUME
THIS DUSK ROOM WITH ITS DARK INTERNAL STAIR
THE INFANT SOUL IN ITS SMALL NURSERY SCHOOL
MID OBJECTS MEANT FOR A LESSON HARDLY LEARNED
OUTGROW ITS EARLY GRAMMAR OF INTELLECT
AND ITS IMITATION OF EARTH-NATURE'S ART
ITS EARTHLY DIALECT TO GOD-LANGUAGE CHANGE
IN LIVING SYMBOLS STUDY REALITY
AND LEARN THE LOGIC OF THE INFINITE
THE IDEAL MUST BE NATURE'S COMMON TRUTH
THE BODY ILLUMINED WITH THE INDWELLING GOD
THE HEART AND MIND FEEL ONE WITH ALL THAT IS
77
A CONSCIOUS SOUL LIVE IN A CONSCIOUS WORLD
AS THROUGH A MIST A SOVEREIGN PEAK IS SEEN
THE GREATNESS OF THE ETERNAL SPIRIT APPEARED
EXILED IN A FRAGMENTED UNIVERSE
AMID HALF-SEMBLANCES OF DIVINER THINGS
THESE NOW COULD SERVE NO MORE HIS REGAL TURN
THE IMMORTAL'S PRIDE REFUSED THE DOOM TO LIVE
A MISER OF THE SCANTY BARGAIN MADE
BETWEEN OUR LITTLENESS AND BOUNDED HOPES
AND THE COMPASSIONATE INFINITUDES
HIS HEIGHT REPELLED THE LOWNESS OF EARTH'S STATE
A WIDENESS DISCONTENTED WITH ITS FRAME
RESILED FROM POOR ASSENT TO NATURE'S TERMS
THE HARSH CONTRACT SPURNED AND THE DIMINISHED LEASE
ONLY BEGINNINGS ARE ACCOMPLISHED HERE
OUR BASE'S MATTER SEEMS ALONE COMPLETE
AN ABSOLUTE MACHINE WITHOUT A SOUL
OR ALL SEEMS A MISFIT OF HALF IDEAS
OR WE SADDLE WITH THE VICE OF EARTHLY FORM
A HURRIED IMPERFECT GLIMPSE OF HEAVENLY THINGS
GUESSES AND TRAVESTIES OF CELESTIAL TYPES
HERE CHAOS SORTS ITSELF INTO A WORLD
A BRIEF FORMATION DRIFTING IN THE VOID
APINGS OF KNOWLEDGE UNFINISHED ARCS OF POWER
FLAMINGS OF BEAUTY INTO EARTHLY SHAPES
LOVE'S BROKEN REFLEXES OF UNITY
SWIM FRAGMENT-MIRRORINGS OF A FLOATING SUN
A PACKED ASSEMBLAGE OF CRUDE TENTATIVE LIVES
ARE PIECED INTO A TESSELLATED WHOLE
THERE IS NO PERFECT ANSWER TO OUR HOPES
THERE ARE BLIND VOICELESS DOORS THAT HAVE NO KEY
THOUGHT CLIMBS IN VAIN AND BRINGS A BORROWED LIGHT
CHEATED BY COUNTERFEITS SOLD TO US IN LIFE'S MART
OUR HEARTS CLUTCH AT A FORFEITED HEAVENLY BLISS
THERE IS PROVENDER FOR THE MIND'S SATIETY
THERE ARE THRILLS OF THE FLESH BUT NOT THE SOUL'S DESIRE
78
HERE EVEN THE HIGHEST RAPTURE TIME CAN GIVE
IS A MIMICRY OF UNGRASPED BEATITUDES
A MUTILATED STATUE OF ECSTASY
A WOUNDED HAPPINESS THAT CANNOT LIVE
A BRIEF FELICITY OF MIND OR SENSE
THROWN BY THE WORLD-POWER TO HER BODY-SLAVE
OR A SIMULACRUM OF ENFORCED DELIGHT
IN THE SERAGLIOS OF IGNORANCE
FOR ALL WE HAVE ACQUIRED SOON LOSES WORTH
AN OLD DISVALUED CREDIT IN TIME'S BANK
IMPERFECTION'S CHEQUE DRAWN ON THE INCONSCIENT
AN INCONSEQUENCE DOGS EVERY EFFORT MADE
AND CHAOS WAITS ON EVERY COSMOS FORMED
IN EACH SUCCESS A SEED OF FAILURE LURKS
HE SAW THE DOUBTFULNESS OF ALL THINGS HERE
THE INCERTITUDE OF MAN'S PROUD CONFIDENT THOUGHT
THE TRANSIENCE OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS FORCE
A THINKING BEING IN AN UNTHINKING WORLD
AN ISLAND IN THE SEA OF THE UNKNOWN
HE IS A SMALLNESS TRYING TO BE GREAT
AN ANIMAL WITH SOME INSTINCTS OF A GOD
HIS LIFE A STORY TOO COMMON TO BE TOLD
HIS DEEDS A NUMBER SUMMING UP TO NOUGHT
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS A TORCH LIT TO BE QUENCHED
HIS HOPE A STAR ABOVE A CRADLE AND GRAVE
AND YET A GREATER DESTINY MAY BE HIS
FOR THE ETERNAL SPIRIT IS HIS TRUTH
HE CAN RE-CREATE HIMSELF AND ALL AROUND
AND FASHION NEW THE WORLD IN WHICH HE LIVES
HE IGNORANT IS THE KNOWER BEYOND TIME
HE IS THE SELF ABOVE NATURE ABOVE FATE
HIS SOUL RETIRED FROM ALL THAT HE HAD DONE
HUSHED WAS THE FUTILE DIN OF HUMAN TOIL
FORSAKEN WHEELED THE CIRCLE OF THE DAYS
IN DISTANCE SANK THE CROWDED TRAMP OF LIFE
79
THE SILENCE WAS HIS SOLE COMPANION LEFT
IMPASSIVE HE LIVED IMMUNE FROM EARTHLY HOPES
A FIGURE IN THE INEFFABLE WITNESS' SHRINE
PACING THE VAST CATHEDRAL OF HIS THOUGHTS
UNDER ITS ARCHES DIM WITH INFINITY
AND HEAVENWARD BROODING OF INVISIBLE WINGS
A CALL WAS ON HIM FROM INTANGIBLE HEIGHTS
INDIFFERENT TO THE LITTLE OUTPOST MIND
HE DWELT IN THE WIDENESS OF THE ETERNAL'S REIGN
HIS BEING NOW EXCEEDED THINKABLE SPACE
HIS BOUNDLESS THOUGHT WAS NEIGHBOUR TO COSMIC SIGHT
A UNIVERSAL LIGHT WAS IN HIS EYES
A GOLDEN INFLUX FLOWED THROUGH HEART AND BRAIN
A FORCE CAME DOWN INTO HIS MORTAL LIMBS
A CURRENT FROM ETERNAL SEAS OF BLISS
HE FELT THE INVASION AND THE NAMELESS JOY
AWARE OF HIS OCCULT OMNIPOTENT SOURCE
ALLURED BY THE OMNISCIENT ECSTASY
A LIVING CENTRE OF THE ILLIMITABLE
WIDENED TO EQUATE WITH THE WORLD'S CIRCUMFERENCE
HE TURNED TO HIS IMMENSE SPIRITUAL FATE
ABANDONED ON A CANVAS OF TORN AIR
A PICTURE LOST IN FAR AND FADING STREAKS
THE EARTH-NATURE'S SUMMITS SANK BELOW HIS FEET
HE CLIMBED TO MEET THE INFINITE MORE ABOVE
THE IMMOBILE'S OCEAN-SILENCE SAW HIM PASS
AN ARROW LEAPING THROUGH ETERNITY
SUDDENLY SHOT FROM THE TENSE BOW OF TIME
A RAY RETURNING TO ITS PARENT SUN
OPPONENT OF THAT GLORY OF ESCAPE
THE BLACK INCONSCIENT SWUNG ITS DRAGON TAIL
LASHING A SLUMBROUS INFINITE BY ITS FORCE
INTO THE DEEP OBSCURITIES OF FORM
DEATH LAY BENEATH HIM LIKE A GATE OF SLEEP
ONE-POINTED TO THE IMMACULATE DELIGHT
QUESTING FOR GOD AS FOR A SPLENDID PREY
80
HE MOUNTED BURNING LIKE A CONE OF FIRE
TO A FEW IS GIVEN THAT GODLIKE RARE RELEASE
ONE AMONG MANY THOUSANDS NEVER TOUCHED
ENGROSSED IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD'S DESIGN
IS CHOSEN BY A SECRET WITNESS EYE
AND DRIVEN BY A POINTING HAND OF LIGHT
ACROSS HIS SOUL'S UNMAPPED IMMENSITUDES
A PILGRIM OF THE EVERLASTING TRUTH
OUR MEASURES CANNOT HOLD HIS MEASURELESS MIND
HE HAS TURNED FROM THE VOICES OF THE NARROW REALM
AND LEFT THE LITTLE LANE OF HUMAN TIME
IN THE HUSHED PRECINCTS OF A VASTER PLAN
HE TREADS THE VESTIBULES OF THE UNSEEN
OR LISTENS FOLLOWING A BODILESS GUIDE
TO A LONELY CRY IN BOUNDLESS VACANCY
ALL THE DEEP COSMIC MURMUR FALLING STILL
HE LIVES IN THE HUSH BEFORE THE WORLD WAS BORN
HIS SOUL LEFT NAKED TO THE TIMELESS ONE
FAR FROM COMPULSION OF CREATED THINGS
THOUGHT AND ITS SHADOWY IDOLS DISAPPEAR
THE MOULDS OF FORM AND PERSON ARE UNDONE
THE INEFFABLE WIDENESS KNOWS HIM FOR ITS OWN
A LONE FORERUNNER OF THE GODWARD EARTH
AMONG THE SYMBOLS OF YET UNSHAPED THINGS
WATCHED BY CLOSED EYES MUTE FACES OF THE UNBORN
HE JOURNEYS TO MEET THE INCOMMUNICABLE
HEARING THE ECHO OF HIS SINGLE STEPS
IN THE ETERNAL COURTS OF SOLITUDE
A NAMELESS MARVEL FILLS THE MOTIONLESS HOURS
HIS SPIRIT MINGLES WITH ETERNITY'S HEART
AND BEARS THE SILENCE OF THE INFINITE
IN A DIVINE RETREAT FROM MORTAL THOUGHT
IN A PRODIGIOUS GESTURE OF SOUL-SIGHT
HIS BEING TOWERED INTO PATHLESS HEIGHTS
NAKED OF ITS VESTURE OF HUMANITY
81
AS THUS IT ROSE TO MEET HIM BARE AND PURE
A STRONG DESCENT LEAPED DOWN A MIGHT A FLAME
A BEAUTY HALF-VISIBLE WITH DEATHLESS EYES
A VIOLENT ECSTASY A SWEETNESS DIRE
ENVELOPED HIM WITH ITS STUPENDOUS LIMBS
AND PENETRATED NERVE AND HEART AND BRAIN
THAT THRILLED AND FAINTED WITH THE EPIPHANY
HIS NATURE SHUDDERED IN THE UNKNOWN'S GRASP
IN A MOMENT SHORTER THAN DEATH LONGER THAN TIME
BY A POWER MORE RUTHLESS THAN LOVE HAPPIER THAN HEAVEN
TAKEN SOVEREIGNLY INTO ETERNAL ARMS
HALED AND COERCED BY A STARK ABSOLUTE BLISS
IN A WHIRLWIND CIRCUIT OF DELIGHT AND FORCE
HURRIED INTO UNIMAGINABLE DEPTHS
UPBORNE INTO IMMEASURABLE HEIGHTS
IT WAS TORN OUT FROM ITS MORTALITY
AND UNDERWENT A NEW AND BOURNELESS CHANGE
AN OMNISCIENT KNOWING WITHOUT SIGHT OR THOUGHT
AN INDECIPHERABLE OMNIPOTENCE
A MYSTIC FORM THAT COULD CONTAIN THE WORLDS
YET MAKE ONE HUMAN BREAST ITS PASSIONATE SHRINE
DREW HIM OUT OF HIS SEEKING LONELINESS
INTO THE MAGNITUDES OF GOD'S EMBRACE
AS WHEN A TIMELESS EYE ANNULS THE HOURS
ABOLISHING THE AGENT AND THE ACT
SO NOW HIS SPIRIT SHONE OUT WIDE BLANK PURE
HIS WAKENED MIND BECAME AN EMPTY SLATE
ON WHICH THE UNIVERSAL AND SOLE COULD WRITE
ALL THAT REPRESSES OUR FALLEN CONSCIOUSNESS
WAS TAKEN FROM HIM LIKE A FORGOTTEN LOAD
A FIRE THAT SEEMED THE BODY OF A GOD
CONSUMED THE LIMITING FIGURES OF THE PAST
AND MADE LARGE ROOM FOR A NEW SELF TO LIVE
ETERNITY'S CONTACT BROKE THE MOULDS OF SENSE
A GREATER FORCE THAN THE EARTHLY HELD HIS LIMBS
HUGE WORKINGS BARED HIS UNDISCOVERED SHEATHS
82
STRANGE ENERGIES WROUGHT AND SCREENED TREMENDOUS HANDS
UNWOUND THE TRIPLE CORD OF MIND AND FREED
THE HEAVENLY WIDENESS OF A GODHEAD'S GAZE
AS THROUGH A DRESS THE WEARER'S SHAPE IS SEEN
THERE REACHED THROUGH FORMS TO THE HIDDEN ABSOLUTE
A COSMIC FEELING AND TRANSCENDENT SIGHT
INCREASED AND HEIGHTENED WERE THE INSTRUMENTS
ILLUSION LOST HER AGGRANDISING LENS
AS FROM HER FAILING HAND THE MEASURES FELL
ATOMIC LOOKED THE THINGS THAT LOOMED SO LARGE
THE LITTLE EGO'S RING COULD JOIN NO MORE
IN THE ENORMOUS SPACES OF THE SELF
THE BODY NOW SEEMED ONLY A WANDERING SHELL
HIS MIND THE MANY-FRESCOED OUTER COURT
OF AN IMPERISHABLE INHABITANT
HIS SPIRIT BREATHED A SUPERHUMAN AIR
THE IMPRISONED DEITY RENT ITS MAGIC FENCE
AS WITH A SOUND OF THUNDER AND OF SEAS
VAST BARRIERS CRASHED AROUND THE HUGE ESCAPE
IMMUTABLY COEVAL WITH THE WORLD
CIRCLE AND END OF EVERY HOPE AND TOIL
INEXORABLY DRAWN ROUND THOUGHT AND ACT
THE FIXED IMMOVABLE PERIPHERIES
EFFACED THEMSELVES BENEATH THE INCARNATE'S TREAD
THE DIRE VELAMEN AND THE BOTTOMLESS CRYPT
BETWEEN WHICH LIFE AND THOUGHT FOR EVER MOVE
FORBIDDEN STILL TO CROSS THE DIM DREAD BOUNDS
THE GUARDIAN DARKNESSES MUTE AND FORMIDABLE
EMPOWERED TO CIRCUMSCRIBE THE WINGLESS SPIRIT
IN THE BOUNDARIES OF MIND AND IGNORANCE
PROTECTING NO MORE A DUAL ETERNITY
VANISHED RESCINDING THEIR ENORMOUS ROLE
ONCE FIGURE OF CREATION'S VAIN ELLIPSE
THE EXPANDING ZERO LOST ITS GIANT CURVE
THE OLD ADAMANTINE VETOES STOOD NO MORE
OVERPOWERED WERE EARTH AND NATURE'S OBSOLETE RULE
83
THE PYTHON COILS OF THE RESTRICTING LAW
COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE SWIFT ARISEN GOD
ABOLISHED WERE THE SCRIPTS OF DESTINY
THERE WAS NO SMALL DEATH-HUNTED CREATURE MORE
NO FRAGILE FORM OF BEING TO PRESERVE
FROM AN ALL-SWALLOWING IMMENSITY
THE GREAT HAMMER-BEATS OF A PENT-UP WORLD-HEART
BURST OPEN THE NARROW DAMS THAT KEEP US SAFE
AGAINST THE FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE
THE SOUL AND COSMOS FACED AS EQUAL POWERS
A BOUNDLESS BEING IN A MEASURELESS TIME
INVADED NATURE WITH THE INFINITE
HE SAW UNPATHED UNWALLED HIS TITAN SCOPE
ALL WAS UNCOVERED TO HIS SEALLESS EYE
A SECRET NATURE STRIPPED OF HER DEFENCE
ONCE IN A DREADED HALF-LIGHT FORMIDABLE
OVERTAKEN IN HER MIGHTY PRIVACY
LAY BARE TO THE BURNING SPLENDOUR OF HIS WILL
IN SHADOWY CHAMBERS LIT BY A STRANGE SUN
AND OPENING HARDLY TO HID MYSTIC KEYS
HER PERILOUS ARCANES AND HOODED POWERS
CONFESSED THE ADVENT OF A MASTERING MIND
AND BORE THE COMPULSION OF A TIME-BORN GAZE
INCALCULABLE IN THEIR WIZARD MODES
IMMEDIATE AND INVINCIBLE IN THE ACT
HER SECRET STRENGTHS NATIVE TO GREATER WORLDS
LIFTED ABOVE OUR NEEDY LIMITED SCOPE
THE OCCULT PRIVILEGE OF DEMIGODS
AND THE SURE POWER-PATTERN OF HER CRYPTIC SIGNS
HER DIAGRAMS OF GEOMETRIC FORCE
HER POTENCIES OF MARVEL-FRAUGHT DESIGN
COURTED EMPLOYMENT BY AN EARTH-NURSED MIGHT
A CONSCIOUS NATURE'S QUICK MACHINERY
ARMED WITH A LATENT SPLENDOUR OF MIRACLE
THE PROPHET-PASSION OF A SEEING MIND
84
AND THE LIGHTNING BARENESS OF A FREE SOUL-FORCE
ALL ONCE IMPOSSIBLE DEEMED COULD NOW BECOME
A NATURAL LIMB OF POSSIBILITY
A NEW DOMAIN OF NORMALCY SUPREME
AN ALMIGHTY OCCULTIST ERECTS IN SPACE
THIS SEEMING OUTWARD WORLD WHICH TRICKS THE SENSE
HE WEAVES HIS HIDDEN THREADS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
HE BUILDS BODIES FOR HIS SHAPELESS ENERGY
OUT OF THE UNFORMED AND VACANT VAST HE HAS MADE
HIS SORCERY OF SOLID IMAGES
HIS MAGIC OF FORMATIVE NUMBER AND DESIGN
THE FIXED IRRATIONAL LINKS NONE CAN ANNUL
THIS CRISS-CROSS TANGLE OF INVISIBLE LAWS
HIS INFALLIBLE RULES HIS COVERED PROCESSES
ACHIEVE UNERRINGLY AN INEXPLICABLE
CREATION WHERE OUR ERROR CARVES DEAD FRAMES
OF KNOWLEDGE FOR A LIVING IGNORANCE
IN HER MYSTERY'S MOODS DIVORCED FROM THE MAKER'S LAWS
SHE TOO AS SOVEREIGNLY CREATES HER FIELD
HER WILL SHAPING THE UNDETERMINED VASTS
MAKING A FINITE OF INFINITY
SHE TOO CAN MAKE AN ORDER OF HER CAPRICE
AS IF HER RASH SUPERB WAGERED TO OUTVIE
THE VEILED CREATOR'S COSMIC SECRECIES
THE RAPID FOOTSTEPS OF HER FANTASY
AMID WHOSE FALLS WONDERS LIKE FLOWERS RISE
ARE SURER THAN REASON DEFTER THAN DEVICE
AND SWIFTER THAN IMAGINATION'S WINGS
ALL SHE NEW-FASHIONS BY THE THOUGHT AND WORD
COMPELS ALL SUBSTANCE BY HER WAND OF MIND
MIND IS A MEDIATOR DIVINITY
ITS POWERS CAN UNDO ALL NATURE'S WORK
MIND CAN SUSPEND OR CHANGE EARTH'S CONCRETE LAW
AFFRANCHISED FROM EARTH-HABIT'S DROWSY SEAL
THE LEADEN GRIP OF MATTER IT CAN BREAK
INDIFFERENT TO THE ANGRY STARE OF DEATH
85
IT CAN IMMORTALISE A MOMENT'S WORK
A SIMPLE FIAT OF ITS THINKING FORCE
THE CASUAL PRESSURE OF ITS SLIGHT ASSENT
CAN LIBERATE THE ENERGY DUMB AND PENT
WITHIN ITS CHAMBERS OF MYSTERIOUS TRANCE
IT MAKES THE BODY'S SLEEP A PUISSANT ARM
HOLDS STILL THE BREATH THE BEATINGS OF THE HEART
WHILE THE UNSEEN IS FOUND THE IMPOSSIBLE DONE
COMMUNICATES WITHOUT MEANS THE UNSPOKEN THOUGHT
IT MOVES EVENTS BY ITS BARE SILENT WILL
ACTS AT A DISTANCE WITHOUT HANDS OR FEET
THIS GIANT IGNORANCE THIS DWARFISH LIFE
IT CAN ILLUMINE WITH A PROPHET SIGHT
INVOKE THE BACCHIC RAPTURE THE FURY'S GOAD
IN OUR BODY AROUSE THE DEMON OR THE GOD
CALL IN THE OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT
AWAKE A FORGOTTEN ALMIGHTINESS WITHIN
IN ITS OWN PLANE A SHINING EMPEROR
EVEN IN THIS RIGID REALM MIND CAN BE KING
THE LOGIC OF ITS DEMIGOD IDEA
IN THE LEAP OF A TRANSITIONAL MOMENT BRINGS
SURPRISES OF CREATION NEVER ACHIEVED
EVEN BY MATTER'S STRANGE UNCONSCIOUS SKILL
ALL'S MIRACLE HERE AND CAN BY MIRACLE CHANGE
THIS IS THAT SECRET NATURE'S EDGE OF MIGHT
ON THE MARGIN OF GREAT IMMATERIAL PLANES
IN KINGDOMS OF AN UNTRAMMELLED GLORY OF FORCE
WHERE MIND IS MASTER OF THE LIFE AND FORM
AND SOUL FULFILS ITS THOUGHTS BY ITS OWN POWER
SHE MEDITATES UPON MIGHTY WORDS AND LOOKS
ON THE UNSEEN LINKS THAT JOIN THE PARTED SPHERES
THENCE TO THE INITIATE WHO OBSERVES HER LAWS
SHE BRINGS THE LIGHT OF HER MYSTERIOUS REALMS
HERE WHERE HE STANDS HIS FEET ON A PROSTRATE WORLD
HIS MIND NO MORE CAST INTO MATTER'S MOULD
OVER THEIR BOUNDS IN SPURTS OF SPLENDID STRENGTH
86
SHE CARRIES THEIR MAGICIAN PROCESSES
AND THE FORMULAS OF THEIR STUPENDOUS SPEECH
TILL HEAVEN AND HELL BECOME PURVEYORS TO EARTH
AND THE UNIVERSE THE SLAVE OF MORTAL WILL
A MEDIATRIX WITH VEILED AND NAMELESS GODS
WHOSE ALIEN WILL TOUCHES OUR HUMAN LIFE
IMITATING THE WORLD-MAGICIAN'S WAYS
SHE INVENTS FOR HER SELF-BOUND FREE-WILL ITS GROOVES
AND FEIGNS FOR MAGIC'S FREAKS A BINDING CAUSE
ALL WORLDS SHE MAKES THE PARTNERS OF HER DEEDS
ACCOMPLICES OF HER MIGHTY VIOLENCE
HER DARING LEAPS INTO THE IMPOSSIBLE
FROM EVERY SOURCE SHE HAS TAKEN HER CUNNING MEANS
SHE DRAWS FROM THE FREE-LOVE MARRIAGE OF THE PLANES
ELEMENTS FOR HER CREATION'S TOUR-DE-FORCE
A WONDER-WEFT OF KNOWLEDGE INCALCULABLE
A COMPENDIUM OF DIVINE INVENTION'S FEATS
SHE HAS COMBINED TO MAKE THE UNREAL TRUE
OR LIBERATE SUPPRESSED REALITY
IN HER UNHEDGED CIRCEAN WONDERLAND
PELL-MELL SHE SHEPHERDS HER OCCULT MIGHTINESSES
HER MNEMONICS OF THE CRAFT OF THE INFINITE
JETS OF THE SCREENED SUBLIMINAL'S CAPRICE
TAGS OF THE GRAMARYE OF INCONSCIENCE
FREEDOM OF A SOVEREIGN TRUTH WITHOUT A LAW
THOUGHTS THAT WERE BORN IN THE IMMORTALS' WORLD
ORACLES THAT BREAK OUT FROM BEHIND THE SHRINE
WARNINGS FROM THE DAEMONIC INNER VOICE
AND PEEPS AND LIGHTNING-LEAPS OF PROPHECY
AND INTIMATIONS TO THE INNER EAR
ABRUPT INTERVENTIONS STARK AND ABSOLUTE
AND THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S UNACCOUNTABLE ACTS
HAVE WOVEN HER BALANCED WEB OF MIRACLES
AND THE WEIRD TECHNIQUE OF HER TREMENDOUS ART
THIS BIZARRE KINGDOM PASSED INTO HIS CHARGE
AS ONE RESISTING MORE THE MORE SHE LOVES
87
HER GREAT POSSESSIONS AND HER POWER AND LORE
SHE GAVE COMPELLED WITH A RELUCTANT JOY
HERSELF SHE GAVE FOR RAPTURE AND FOR USE
ABSOLVED FROM ABERRATIONS IN DEEP WAYS
THE ENDS SHE RECOVERED FOR WHICH SHE WAS MADE
SHE TURNED AGAINST THE EVIL SHE HAD HELPED
HER ENGINED WRATH HER INVISIBLE MEANS TO SLAY
HER DANGEROUS MOODS AND ARBITRARY FORCE
SHE SURRENDERED TO THE SERVICE OF THE SOUL
AND THE CONTROL OF A SPIRITUAL WILL
A GREATER DESPOT TAMED HER DESPOTISM
ASSAILED SURPRISED IN THE FORTRESS OF HER SELF
CONQUERED BY HER OWN UNEXPECTED KING
FULFILLED AND RANSOMED BY HER SERVITUDE
SHE YIELDED IN A VANQUISHED ECSTASY
HER SEALED HERMETIC WISDOM FORCED FROM HER
FRAGMENTS OF THE MYSTERY OF OMNIPOTENCE
A BORDER SOVEREIGN IS THE OCCULT FORCE
A THRESHOLD GUARDIAN OF THE EARTH-SCENE'S BEYOND
SHE HAS CANALISED THE OUTBREAKS OF THE GODS
AND CUT THROUGH VISTAS OF INTUITIVE SIGHT
A LONG ROAD OF SHIMMERING DISCOVERIES
THE WORLDS OF A MARVELLOUS UNKNOWN WERE NEAR
BEHIND HER AN INEFFABLE PRESENCE STOOD
HER REIGN RECEIVED THEIR MYSTIC INFLUENCES
THEIR LION-FORCES CROUCHED BENEATH HER FEET
THE FUTURE SLEEPS UNKNOWN BEHIND THEIR DOORS
ABYSMS INFERNAL GAPED ROUND THE SOUL'S STEPS
AND CALLED TO ITS MOUNTING VISION PEAKS DIVINE
AN ENDLESS CLIMB AND ADVENTURE OF THE IDEA
THERE TIRELESSLY TEMPTED THE EXPLORER MIND
AND COUNTLESS VOICES VISITED THE CHARMED EAR
A MILLION FIGURES PASSED AND WERE SEEN NO MORE
THIS WAS A FOREFRONT OF GOD'S THOUSANDFOLD HOUSE
BEGINNINGS OF THE HALF-SCREENED INVISIBLE
88
A MAGIC PORCH OF ENTRY GLIMMERING
QUIVERED IN A PENUMBRA OF SCREENED LIGHT
A COURT OF THE MYSTICAL TRAFFIC OF THE WORLDS
A BALCONY AND MIRACULOUS FACADE
ABOVE HER LIGHTENED HIGH IMMENSITIES
ALL THE UNKNOWN LOOKED OUT FROM BOUNDLESSNESS
IT LODGED UPON AN EDGE OF HOURLESS TIME
GAZING OUT OF SOME EVERLASTING NOW
ITS SHADOWS GLEAMING WITH THE BIRTH OF GODS
ITS BODIES SIGNALLING THE BODILESS
ITS FOREHEADS GLOWING WITH THE OVERSOUL
ITS FORMS PROJECTED FROM THE UNKNOWABLE
ITS EYES DREAMING OF THE INEFFABLE
ITS FACES STARING INTO ETERNITY
LIFE IN HIM LEARNED ITS HUGE SUBCONSCIENT REAR
THE LITTLE FRONTS UNLOCKED TO THE UNSEEN VASTS
HER GULFS STOOD NUDE HER FAR TRANSCENDENCES
FLAMED IN TRANSPARENCIES OF CROWDED LIGHT
A GIANT ORDER WAS DISCOVERED HERE
OF WHICH THE TASSEL AND EXTENDED FRINGE
ARE THE SCANT STUFF OF OUR MATERIAL LIVES
THIS OVERT UNIVERSE WHOSE FIGURES HIDE
THE SECRETS MERGED IN SUPERCONSCIENT LIGHT
WROTE CLEAR THE LETTERS OF ITS GLOWING CODE
A MAP OF SUBTLE SIGNS SURPASSING THOUGHT
WAS HUNG UPON A WALL OF INMOST MIND
ILLUMINING THE WORLD'S CONCRETE IMAGES
INTO SIGNIFICANT SYMBOLS BY ITS GLOSS
IT OFFERED TO THE INTUITIVE EXEGETE
ITS REFLEX OF THE ETERNAL MYSTERY
ASCENDING AND DESCENDING TWIXT LIFE'S POLES
THE SERIED KINGDOMS OF THE GRADED LAW
PLUNGED FROM THE EVERLASTING INTO TIME
THEN GLAD OF A GLORY OF MULTITUDINOUS MIND
AND RICH WITH LIFE'S ADVENTURE AND DELIGHT
89
AND PACKED WITH THE BEAUTY OF MATTER'S SHAPES AND HUES
CLIMBED BACK FROM TIME INTO UNDYING SELF
UP A GOLDEN LADDER CARRYING THE SOUL
TYING WITH DIAMOND THREADS THE SPIRIT'S EXTREMES
IN THIS DROP FROM CONSCIOUSNESS TO CONSCIOUSNESS
EACH LEANED ON THE OCCULT INCONSCIENT'S POWER
THE FOUNTAIN OF ITS NEEDED IGNORANCE
ARCHMASON OF THE LIMITS BY WHICH IT LIVES
IN THIS SOAR FROM CONSCIOUSNESS TO CONSCIOUSNESS
EACH LIFTED TOPS TO THAT FROM WHICH IT CAME
ORIGIN OF ALL THAT IT HAD EVER BEEN
AND HOME OF ALL THAT IT COULD STILL BECOME
AN ORGAN SCALE OF THE ETERNAL'S ACTS
MOUNTING TO THEIR CLIMAX IN AN ENDLESS CALM
PACES OF THE MANY-VISAGED WONDERFUL
PREDESTINED STADIA OF THE EVOLVING WAY
MEASURES OF THE STATURE OF THE GROWING SOUL
THEY INTERPRETED EXISTENCE TO ITSELF
AND MEDIATING TWIXT THE HEIGHTS AND DEEPS
UNITED THE VEILED MARRIED OPPOSITES
AND LINKED CREATION TO THE INEFFABLE
A LAST HIGH WORLD WAS SEEN WHERE ALL WORLDS MEET
IN ITS SUMMIT GLEAM WHERE NIGHT IS NOT NOR SLEEP
THE LIGHT BEGAN OF THE TRINITY SUPREME
ALL THERE DISCOVERED WHAT IT SEEKS FOR HERE
IT FREED THE FINITE INTO BOUNDLESSNESS
AND ROSE INTO ITS OWN ETERNITIES
THE INCONSCIENT FOUND ITS HEART OF CONSCIOUSNESS
THE IDEA AND FEELING GROPING IN IGNORANCE
AT LAST CLUTCHED PASSIONATELY THE BODY OF TRUTH
THE MUSIC BORN IN MATTER'S SILENCES
PLUCKED NUDE OUT OF THE INEFFABLE'S FATHOMLESSNESS
THE MEANING IT HAD HELD BUT COULD NOT VOICE
THE PERFECT RHYTHM NOW ONLY SOMETIMES DREAMED
AN ANSWER BROUGHT TO THE TORN EARTH'S HUNGRY NEED
RENDING THE NIGHT THAT HAD CONCEALED THE UNKNOWN
90
GIVING TO HER HER LOST FORGOTTEN SOUL
A GRAND SOLUTION CLOSED THE LONG IMPASSE
IN WHICH THE HEIGHTS OF MORTAL EFFORT END
A RECONCILING WISDOM LOOKED ON LIFE
IT TOOK THE STRIVING UNDERTONES OF MIND
AND TOOK THE CONFUSED REFRAIN OF HUMAN HOPES
AND MADE OF THEM A SWEET AND HAPPY CALL
IT LIFTED FROM AN UNDERGROUND OF PAIN
THE INARTICULATE MURMUR OF OUR LIVES
AND FOUND FOR IT A SENSE ILLIMITABLE
A MIGHTY ONENESS ITS PERPETUAL THEME
IT CAUGHT THE SOUL'S FAINT SCATTERED UTTERANCES
READ HARDLY TWIXT OUR LINES OF RIGID THOUGHT
OR MID THIS DROWSE AND COMA ON MATTER'S BREAST
HEARD LIKE DISJOINTED MUTTERINGS IN SLEEP
IT GROUPED THE GOLDEN LINKS THAT THEY HAD LOST
AND SHOWED TO THEM THEIR DIVINE UNITY
SAVING FROM THE ERROR OF DIVIDED SELF
THE DEEP SPIRITUAL CRY IN ALL THAT IS
ALL THE GREAT WORDS THAT TOILED TO EXPRESS THE ONE
WERE LIFTED INTO AN ABSOLUTENESS OF LIGHT
AN EVER-BURNING REVELATION'S FIRE
AND THE IMMORTALITY OF THE ETERNAL VOICE
THERE WAS NO QUARREL MORE OF TRUTH WITH TRUTH
THE ENDLESS CHAPTER OF THEIR DIFFERENCES
RETOLD IN LIGHT BY AN OMNISCIENT SCRIBE
TRAVELLED THROUGH DIFFERENCE TOWARDS UNITY
MIND'S WINDING SEARCH LOST EVERY TINGE OF DOUBT
LED TO ITS END BY AN ALL-SEEING SPEECH
THAT GARBED THE INITIAL AND ORIGINAL THOUGHT
WITH THE FINALITY OF AN ULTIMATE PHRASE
UNITED WERE TIME'S CREATIVE MOOD AND TENSE
TO THE STYLE AND SYNTAX OF IDENTITY
A PAEAN SWELLED FROM THE LOST MUSING DEEPS
AN ANTHEM PEALED TO THE TRIUNE ECSTASIES
A CRY OF THE MOMENTS TO THE IMMORTAL'S BLISS
91
AS IF THE STROPHES OF A COSMIC ODE
A HIERARCHY OF CLIMBING HARMONIES
PEOPLED WITH VOICES AND WITH VISAGES
ASPIRED IN A CRESCENDO OF THE GODS
FROM MATTER'S ABYSSES TO THE SPIRIT'S PEAKS
ABOVE WERE THE IMMORTAL'S CHANGELESS SEATS
WHITE CHAMBERS OF DALLIANCE WITH ETERNITY
AND THE STUPENDOUS GATES OF THE ALONE
ACROSS THE UNFOLDING OF THE SEAS OF SELF
APPEARED THE DEATHLESS COUNTRIES OF THE ONE
A MANY-MIRACLED CONSCIOUSNESS UNROLLED
VAST AIM AND PROCESS AND UNFETTERED NORMS
A LARGER NATURE'S GREAT FAMILIAR ROADS
AFFRANCHISED FROM THE NET OF EARTHLY SENSE
CALM CONTINENTS OF POTENCY WERE GLIMPSED
HOMELANDS OF BEAUTY SHUT TO HUMAN EYES
HALF-SEEN AT FIRST THROUGH WONDER'S GLEAMING LIDS
SURPRISED THE VISION WITH FELICITY
SUNBELTS OF KNOWLEDGE MOONBELTS OF DELIGHT
STRETCHED OUT IN AN ECSTASY OF WIDENESSES
BEYOND OUR INDIGENT CORPOREAL RANGE
THERE HE COULD ENTER THERE AWHILE ABIDE
A VOYAGER UPON UNCHARTED ROUTES
FRONTING THE VIEWLESS DANGER OF THE UNKNOWN
ADVENTURING ACROSS ENORMOUS REALMS
HE BROKE INTO ANOTHER SPACE AND TIME
95
ALONE HE MOVED WATCHED BY THE INFINITY
AROUND HIM AND THE UNKNOWABLE ABOVE
ALL COULD BE SEEN THAT SHUNS THE MORTAL EYE
ALL COULD BE KNOWN THE MIND HAS NEVER GRASPED
ALL COULD BE DONE NO MORTAL WILL CAN DARE
A LIMITLESS MOVEMENT FILLED A LIMITLESS PEACE
IN A PROFOUND EXISTENCE BEYOND EARTH'S
PARENT OR KIN TO OUR IDEAS AND DREAMS
WHERE SPACE IS A VAST EXPERIMENT OF THE SOUL
IN AN IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE LINKED TO OURS
IN A DEEP ONENESS OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE
THE UNIVERSE OF THE UNKNOWN AROSE
A SELF-CREATION WITHOUT END OR PAUSE
REVEALED THE GRANDEURS OF THE INFINITE
IT FLUNG INTO THE HAZARDS OF ITS PLAY
A MILLION MOODS A MYRIAD ENERGIES
THE WORLD-SHAPES THAT ARE FANCIES OF ITS TRUTH
AND THE FORMULAS OF THE FREEDOM OF ITS FORCE
IT POURED INTO THE EVER-STABLE'S FLUX
A BACCHIC RAPTURE AND REVEL OF IDEAS
A PASSION AND MOTION OF EVERLASTINGNESS
THERE ROSE UNBORN INTO THE UNCHANGING'S SURGE
THOUGHTS THAT ABIDE IN THEIR DEATHLESS CONSEQUENCE
WORDS THAT IMMORTAL LAST THOUGH FALLEN MUTE
ACTS THAT BROUGHT OUT FROM SILENCE ITS DUMB SENSE
LINES THAT CONVEY THE INEXPRESSIBLE
THE ETERNAL'S STILLNESS SAW IN UNMOVED JOY
HIS UNIVERSAL POWER AT WORK DISPLAY
IN PLOTS OF PAIN AND DRAMAS OF DELIGHT
THE WONDER AND BEAUTY OF HER WILL TO BE
ALL EVEN PAIN WAS THE SOUL'S PLEASURE HERE
96
HERE ALL EXPERIENCE WAS A SINGLE PLAN
THE THOUSANDFOLD EXPRESSION OF THE ONE
ALL CAME AT ONCE INTO HIS SINGLE VIEW
NOTHING ESCAPED HIS VAST INTUITIVE SIGHT
NOTHING DREW NEAR HE COULD NOT FEEL AS KIN
HE WAS ONE SPIRIT WITH THAT IMMENSITY
IMAGES IN A SUPERNAL CONSCIOUSNESS
EMBODYING THE UNBORN WHO NEVER DIES
THE STRUCTURED VISIONS OF THE COSMIC SELF
ALIVE WITH THE TOUCH OF BEING'S ETERNITY
LOOKED AT HIM LIKE FORM-BOUND SPIRITUAL THOUGHTS
FIGURING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE INEFFABLE
ASPECTS OF BEING DONNED WORLD-OUTLINE FORMS
THAT OPEN MOVING DOORS ON THINGS DIVINE
BECAME FAMILIAR TO HIS HOURLY SIGHT
THE SYMBOLS OF THE SPIRIT'S REALITY
THE LIVING BODIES OF THE BODILESS
GREW NEAR TO HIM HIS DAILY ASSOCIATES
THE EXHAUSTLESS SEEINGS OF THE UNSLEEPING MIND
LETTERINGS OF ITS CONTACT WITH THE INVISIBLE
SURROUNDED HIM WITH COUNTLESS POINTING SIGNS
THE VOICES OF A THOUSAND REALMS OF LIFE
MISSIONED TO HIM HER MIGHTY MESSAGES
THE HEAVEN-HINTS THAT INVADE OUR EARTHLY LIVES
THE DIRE IMAGINATIONS DREAMED BY HELL
WHICH IF ENACTED AND EXPERIENCED HERE
OUR DULLED CAPACITY SOON WOULD CEASE TO FEEL
OR OUR MORTAL FRAILTY COULD NOT LONG ENDURE
WERE SET IN THEIR SUBLIME PROPORTIONS THERE
THERE LIVED OUT IN THEIR SELF-BORN ATMOSPHERE
THEY RESUMED THEIR TOPLESS PITCH AND NATIVE POWER
THEIR FORTIFYING STRESS UPON THE SOUL
BIT DEEP INTO THE GROUND OF CONSCIOUSNESS
THE PASSION AND PURITY OF THEIR EXTREMES
THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THEIR SINGLE CRY
AND THE SOVEREIGN SWEETNESS OR VIOLENT POETRY
97
OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL OR TERRIBLE DELIGHT
ALL THOUGHT CAN KNOW OR WIDEST SIGHT PERCEIVE
AND ALL THAT THOUGHT AND SIGHT CAN NEVER KNOW
ALL THINGS OCCULT AND RARE REMOTE AND STRANGE
WERE NEAR TO HEART'S CONTACT FELT BY SPIRIT-SENSE
ASKING FOR ENTRY AT HIS NATURE'S GATES
THEY CROWDED THE WIDENED SPACES OF HIS MIND
HIS SELF-DISCOVERY'S FLAMING WITNESSES
OFFERING THEIR MARVEL AND THEIR MULTITUDE
THESE NOW BECAME NEW PORTIONS OF HIMSELF
THE FIGURES OF HIS SPIRIT'S GREATER LIFE
THE MOVING SCENERY OF HIS LARGE TIME-WALK
OR THE EMBROIDERED TISSUE OF HIS SENSE
THESE TOOK THE PLACE OF INTIMATE HUMAN THINGS
AND MOVED AS CLOSE COMPANIONS OF HIS THOUGHTS
OR WERE HIS SOUL'S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
TIRELESS THE HEART'S ADVENTURE OF DELIGHT
ENDLESS THE KINGDOMS OF THE SPIRIT'S BLISS
UNNUMBERED TONES STRUCK FROM ONE HARMONY'S STRINGS
EACH TO ITS WIDE-WINGED UNIVERSAL POISE
ITS FATHOMLESS FEELING OF THE ALL IN ONE
BROUGHT NOTES OF SOME PERFECTION YET UNSEEN
ITS SINGLE RETREAT INTO TRUTH'S SECRECIES
ITS HAPPY SIDELIGHT ON THE INFINITE
ALL WAS FOUND THERE THE UNIQUE HAS DREAMED AND MADE
TINGING WITH CEASELESS RAPTURE AND SURPRISE
AND AN OPULENT BEAUTY OF PASSIONATE DIFFERENCE
THE RECURRING BEAT THAT MOMENTS GOD IN TIME
ONLY WAS MISSING THE SOLE TIMELESS WORD
THAT CARRIES ETERNITY IN ITS LONELY SOUND
THE IDEA SELF-LUMINOUS KEY TO ALL IDEAS
THE INTEGER OF THE SPIRIT'S PERFECT SUM
THAT EQUATES THE UNEQUAL ALL TO THE EQUAL ONE
THE SINGLE SIGN INTERPRETING EVERY SIGN
THE ABSOLUTE INDEX TO THE ABSOLUTE
98
THERE WALLED APART BY ITS OWN INNERNESS
IN A MYSTICAL BARRAGE OF DYNAMIC LIGHT
HE SAW A LONE IMMENSE HIGH-CURVED WORLD-PILE
ERECT LIKE A MOUNTAIN-CHARIOT OF THE GODS
MOTIONLESS UNDER AN INSCRUTABLE SKY
AS IF FROM MATTER'S PLINTH AND VIEWLESS BASE
TO A TOP AS VIEWLESS A CARVED SEA OF WORLDS
CLIMBING WITH FOAM-MANED WAVES TO THE SUPREME
ASCENDED TOWARDS BREADTHS IMMEASURABLE
IT HOPED TO SOAR INTO THE INEFFABLE'S REIGN
A HUNDRED LEVELS RAISED IT TO THE UNKNOWN
SO IT TOWERED UP TO HEIGHTS INTANGIBLE
AND DISAPPEARED IN THE HUSHED CONSCIOUS VAST
AS CLIMBS A STOREYED TEMPLE-TOWER TO HEAVEN
BUILT BY THE ASPIRING SOUL OF MAN TO LIVE
NEAR TO HIS DREAM OF THE INVISIBLE
INFINITY CALLS TO IT AS IT DREAMS AND CLIMBS
ITS SPIRE TOUCHES THE APEX OF THE WORLD
MOUNTING INTO GREAT VOICELESS STILLNESSES
IT MARRIES THE EARTH TO SCREENED ETERNITIES
AMID THE MANY SYSTEMS OF THE ONE
MADE BY AN INTERPRETING CREATIVE JOY
ALONE IT POINTS US TO OUR JOURNEY BACK
OUT OF OUR LONG SELF-LOSS IN NATURE'S DEEPS
PLANTED ON EARTH IT HOLDS IN IT ALL REALMS
IT IS A BRIEF COMPENDIUM OF THE VAST
THIS WAS THE SINGLE STAIR TO BEING'S GOAL
A SUMMARY OF THE STAGES OF THE SPIRIT
ITS COPY OF THE COSMIC HIERARCHIES
REFASHIONED IN OUR SECRET AIR OF SELF
A SUBTLE PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE
IT IS WITHIN BELOW WITHOUT ABOVE
ACTING UPON THIS VISIBLE NATURE'S SCHEME
IT WAKENS OUR EARTH-MATTER'S HEAVY DOZE
TO THINK AND FEEL AND TO REACT TO JOY
IT MODELS IN US OUR DIVINER PARTS
99
LIFTS MORTAL MIND INTO A GREATER AIR
MAKES YEARN THIS LIFE OF FLESH TO INTANGIBLE AIMS
LINKS THE BODY'S DEATH WITH IMMORTALITY'S CALL
OUT OF THE SWOON OF THE INCONSCIENCE
IT LABOURS TOWARDS A SUPERCONSCIENT LIGHT
IF EARTH WERE ALL AND THIS WERE NOT IN HER
THOUGHT COULD NOT BE NOR LIFE-DELIGHT'S RESPONSE
ONLY MATERIAL FORMS COULD THEN BE HER GUESTS
DRIVEN BY AN INANIMATE WORLD-FORCE
EARTH BY THIS GOLDEN SUPERFLUITY
BORE THINKING MAN AND MORE THAN MAN SHALL BEAR
THIS HIGHER SCHEME OF BEING IS OUR CAUSE
AND HOLDS THE KEY TO OUR ASCENDING FATE
IT CALLS OUT OF OUR DENSE MORTALITY
THE CONSCIOUS SPIRIT NURSED IN MATTER'S HOUSE
THE LIVING SYMBOL OF THESE CONSCIOUS PLANES
ITS INFLUENCES AND GODHEADS OF THE UNSEEN
ITS UNTHOUGHT LOGIC OF REALITY'S ACTS
ARISEN FROM THE UNSPOKEN TRUTH IN THINGS
HAVE FIXED OUR INNER LIFE'S SLOW-SCALED DEGREES
ITS STEPS ARE PACES OF THE SOUL'S RETURN
FROM THE DEEP ADVENTURE OF MATERIAL BIRTH
A LADDER OF DELIVERING ASCENT
AND RUNGS THAT NATURE CLIMBS TO DEITY
ONCE IN THE VIGIL OF A DEATHLESS GAZE
THESE GRADES HAD MARKED HER GIANT DOWNWARD PLUNGE
THE WIDE AND PRONE LEAP OF A GODHEAD'S FALL
OUR LIFE IS A HOLOCAUST OF THE SUPREME
THE GREAT WORLD-MOTHER BY HER SACRIFICE
HAS MADE HER SOUL THE BODY OF OUR STATE
ACCEPTING SORROW AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS
DIVINITY'S LAPSE FROM ITS OWN SPLENDOURS WOVE
THE MANY-PATTERNED GROUND OF ALL WE ARE
AN IDOL OF SELF IS OUR MORTALITY
OUR EARTH IS A FRAGMENT AND A RESIDUE
HER POWER IS PACKED WITH THE STUFF OF GREATER WORLDS
100
AND STEEPED IN THEIR COLOUR-LUSTRES DIMMED BY HER DROWSE
AN ATAVISM OF HIGHER BIRTHS IS HERS
HER SLEEP IS STIRRED BY THEIR BURIED MEMORIES
RECALLING THE LOST SPHERES FROM WHICH THEY FELL
UNSATISFIED FORCES IN HER BOSOM MOVE
THEY ARE PARTNERS OF HER GREATER GROWING FATE
AND HER RETURN TO IMMORTALITY
THEY CONSENT TO SHARE HER DOOM OF BIRTH AND DEATH
THEY KINDLE PARTIAL GLEAMS OF THE ALL AND DRIVE
HER BLIND LABORIOUS SPIRIT TO COMPOSE
A MEAGRE IMAGE OF THE MIGHTY WHOLE
THE CALM AND LUMINOUS INTIMACY WITHIN
APPROVES HER WORK AND GUIDES THE UNSEEING POWER
HIS VAST DESIGN ACCEPTS A PUNY START
AN ATTEMPT A DRAWING HALF-DONE IS THE WORLD'S LIFE
ITS LINES DOUBT THEIR CONCEALED SIGNIFICANCE
ITS CURVES JOIN NOT THEIR HIGH INTENDED CLOSE
YET SOME FIRST IMAGE OF GREATNESS TREMBLES THERE
AND WHEN THE AMBIGUOUS CROWDED PARTS HAVE MET
THE MANY-TONED UNITY TO WHICH THEY MOVED
THE ARTIST'S JOY SHALL LAUGH AT REASON'S RULES
THE DIVINE INTENTION SUDDENLY SHALL BE SEEN
THE END VINDICATE INTUITION'S SURE TECHNIQUE
A GRAPH SHALL BE OF MANY MEETING WORLDS
A CUBE AND UNION-CRYSTAL OF THE GODS
A MIND SHALL THINK BEHIND NATURE'S MINDLESS MASK
A CONSCIOUS VAST FILL THE OLD DUMB BRUTE SPACE
THIS FAINT AND FLUID SKETCH OF SOUL CALLED MAN
SHALL STAND OUT ON THE BACKGROUND OF LONG TIME
A GLOWING EPITOME OF ETERNITY
A LITTLE POINT REVEAL THE INFINITUDES
A MYSTERY'S PROCESS IS THE UNIVERSE
AT FIRST WAS LAID A STRANGE ANOMALOUS BASE
A VOID A CIPHER OF SOME SECRET WHOLE
WHERE ZERO HELD INFINITY IN ITS SUM
AND ALL AND NOTHING WERE A SINGLE TERM
101
AN ETERNAL NEGATIVE A MATRIX NOUGHT
INTO ITS FORMS THE CHILD IS EVER BORN
WHO LIVES FOR EVER IN THE VASTS OF GOD
A SLOW REVERSAL'S MOVEMENT THEN TOOK PLACE
A GAS BELCHED OUT FROM SOME INVISIBLE FIRE
OF ITS DENSE RINGS WERE FORMED THESE MILLION STARS
UPON EARTH'S NEW-BORN SOIL GOD'S TREAD WAS HEARD
ACROSS THE THICK SMOKE OF EARTH'S IGNORANCE
A MIND BEGAN TO SEE AND LOOK AT FORMS
AND GROPED FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE NESCIENT NIGHT
CAUGHT IN A BLIND STONE-GRIP FORCE WORKED ITS PLAN
AND MADE IN SLEEP THIS HUGE MECHANICAL WORLD
THAT MATTER MIGHT GROW CONSCIOUS OF ITS SOUL
AND LIKE A BUSY MIDWIFE THE LIFE-POWER
DELIVER THE ZERO CARRIER OF THE ALL
BECAUSE ETERNAL EYES TURNED ON EARTH'S GULFS
THE LUCENT CLARITY OF A PURE REGARD
AND SAW A SHADOW OF THE UNKNOWABLE
MIRRORED IN THE INCONSCIENT'S BOUNDLESS SLEEP
CREATION'S SEARCH FOR SELF BEGAN ITS STIR
A SPIRIT DREAMED IN THE CRUDE COSMIC WHIRL
MIND FLOWED UNKNOWING IN THE SAP OF LIFE
AND MATTER'S BREASTS SUCKLED THE DIVINE IDEA
A MIRACLE OF THE ABSOLUTE WAS BORN
INFINITY PUT ON A FINITE SOUL
ALL OCEAN LIVED WITHIN A WANDERING DROP
A TIME-MADE BODY HOUSED THE ILLIMITABLE
TO LIVE THIS MYSTERY OUT OUR SOULS CAME HERE
A SEER WITHIN WHO KNOWS THE ORDERED PLAN
CONCEALED BEHIND OUR MOMENTARY STEPS
INSPIRES OUR ASCENT TO VIEWLESS HEIGHTS
AS ONCE THE ABYSMAL LEAP TO EARTH AND LIFE
HIS CALL HAD REACHED THE TRAVELLER IN TIME
APART IN AN UNFATHOMED LONELINESS
HE TRAVELLED IN HIS MUTE AND SINGLE STRENGTH
102
BEARING THE BURDEN OF THE WORLD'S DESIRE
A FORMLESS STILLNESS CALLED A NAMELESS LIGHT
ABOVE HIM WAS THE WHITE IMMOBILE RAY
AROUND HIM THE ETERNAL SILENCES
NO TERM WAS FIXED TO THE HIGH-PITCHED ATTEMPT
WORLD AFTER WORLD DISCLOSED ITS GUARDED POWERS
HEAVEN AFTER HEAVEN ITS DEEP BEATITUDES
BUT STILL THE INVISIBLE MAGNET DREW HIS SOUL
A FIGURE SOLE ON NATURE'S GIANT STAIR
HE MOUNTED TOWARDS AN INDISCERNIBLE END
ON THE BARE SUMMIT OF CREATED THINGS
103
IN THE IMPALPABLE FIELD OF SECRET SELF
THIS LITTLE OUTER BEING'S VAST SUPPORT
PARTED FROM VISION BY EARTH'S SOLID FENCE
HE CAME INTO A MAGIC CRYSTAL AIR
AND FOUND A LIFE THAT LIVED NOT BY THE FLESH
A LIGHT THAT MADE VISIBLE IMMATERIAL THINGS
A FINE DEGREE IN WONDER'S HIERARCHY
THE KINGDOM OF SUBTLE MATTER'S FAERY CRAFT
OUTLINED AGAINST A SKY OF VIVID HUES
LEAPING OUT OF A SPLENDOUR-TRANCE AND HAZE
THE WIZARD REVELATION OF ITS FRONT
A WORLD OF LOVELIER FORMS LIES NEAR TO OURS
WHERE UNDISGUISED BY EARTH'S DEFORMING SIGHT
ALL SHAPES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND ALL THINGS TRUE
IN THAT LUCENT AMBIENCE MYSTICALLY CLEAR
THE EYES WERE DOORS TO A CELESTIAL SENSE
HEARING WAS MUSIC AND THE TOUCH A CHARM
AND THE HEART DREW A DEEPER BREATH OF POWER
THERE DWELL EARTH-NATURE'S SHINING ORIGINS
THE PERFECT PLANS ON WHICH SHE MOULDS HER WORKS
THE DISTANT OUTCOMES OF HER TRAVAILING FORCE
REPOSE IN A FRAMEWORK OF ESTABLISHED FATE
ATTEMPTED VAINLY NOW OR WON IN VAIN
ALREADY WERE MAPPED AND SCHEDULED THERE THE TIME
AND FIGURE OF HER FUTURE SOVEREIGNTIES
IN THE SUMPTUOUS LINEAMENTS TRACED BY DESIRE
THE GOLDEN ISSUE OF MIND'S LABYRINTH PLOTS
THE RICHES UNFOUND OR STILL UNCAUGHT BY OUR LIVES
UNSULLIED BY THE ATTAINT OF MORTAL THOUGHT
ABIDE IN THAT PELLUCID ATMOSPHERE
OUR VAGUE BEGINNINGS ARE OVERTAKEN THERE
104
OUR MIDDLE TERMS SKETCHED OUT IN PRESCIENT LINES
OUR FINISHED ENDS ANTICIPATED LIVE
THIS BRILLIANT ROOF OF OUR DESCENDING PLANE
INTERCEPTING THE FREE BOON OF HEAVEN'S AIR
ADMITS SMALL INRUSHES OF A MIGHTY BREATH
OR FRAGRANT CIRCUITS THROUGH GOLD LATTICES
IT SHIELDS OUR CEILING OF TERRESTRIAL MIND
FROM DEATHLESS SUNS AND THE STREAMING OF GOD'S RAIN
YET CANALISES A STRANGE IRISED GLOW
AND BRIGHT DEWS DRIP FROM THE IMMORTAL'S SKY
A PASSAGE FOR THE POWERS THAT MOVE OUR DAYS
OCCULT BEHIND THIS GROSSER NATURE'S WALLS
A GOSSAMER MARRIAGE-HALL OF MIND WITH FORM
IS HIDDEN BY A TAPESTRY OF DREAMS
HEAVEN'S MEANINGS STEAL THROUGH IT AS THROUGH A VEIL
ITS INNER SIGHT SUSTAINS THIS OUTER SCENE
A FINER CONSCIOUSNESS WITH HAPPIER LINES
IT HAS A TACT OUR TOUCH CANNOT ATTAIN
A PURITY OF SENSE WE NEVER FEEL
ITS INTERCESSION WITH THE ETERNAL RAY
INSPIRES OUR TRANSIENT EARTH'S BRIEF-LIVED ATTEMPTS
AT BEAUTY AND THE PERFECT SHAPE OF THINGS
IN ROOMS OF THE YOUNG DIVINITY OF POWER
AND EARLY PLAY OF THE ETERNAL CHILD
THE EMBODIMENTS OF HIS OUTWINGING THOUGHTS
LAVED IN A BRIGHT EVERLASTING WONDER'S TINTS
AND LULLED BY WHISPERS OF THAT LUCID AIR
TAKE DREAM-HUED REST LIKE BIRDS ON TIMELESS TREES
BEFORE THEY DIVE TO FLOAT ON EARTH-TIME'S SEA
ALL THAT HERE SEEMS HAS LOVELIER SEMBLANCE THERE
WHATEVER OUR HEARTS CONCEIVE OUR HEADS CREATE
SOME HIGH ORIGINAL BEAUTY FORFEITING
THENCE EXILED HERE CONSENTS TO AN EARTHLY TINGE
WHATEVER IS HERE OF VISIBLE CHARM AND GRACE
FINDS THERE ITS FAULTLESS AND IMMORTAL LINES
ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL HERE IS THERE DIVINE
105
FIGURES ARE THERE UNDREAMED BY MORTAL MIND
BODIES THAT HAVE NO EARTHLY COUNTERPART
TRAVERSE THE INNER EYE'S ILLUMINED TRANCE
AND RAVISH THE HEART WITH THEIR CELESTIAL TREAD
PERSUADING HEAVEN TO INHABIT THAT WONDER SPHERE
THE FUTURE'S MARVELS WANDER IN ITS GULFS
THINGS OLD AND NEW ARE FASHIONED IN THOSE DEPTHS
A CARNIVAL OF BEAUTY CROWDS THE HEIGHTS
IN THAT MAGIC KINGDOM OF IDEAL SIGHT
IN ITS ANTECHAMBERS OF SPLENDID PRIVACY
MATTER AND SOUL IN CONSCIOUS UNION MEET
LIKE LOVERS IN A LONELY SECRET PLACE
IN THE CLASP OF A PASSION NOT YET UNFORTUNATE
THEY JOIN THEIR STRENGTH AND SWEETNESS AND DELIGHT
AND MINGLING MAKE THE HIGH AND LOW WORLDS ONE
INTRUDER FROM THE FORMLESS INFINITE
DARING TO BREAK INTO THE INCONSCIENT'S REIGN
THE SPIRIT'S LEAP TOWARDS BODY TOUCHES GROUND
AS YET UNWRAPPED IN EARTHLY LINEAMENTS
ALREADY IT WEARS OUTLASTING DEATH AND BIRTH
CONVINCING THE ABYSS BY HEAVENLY FORM
A COVERING OF ITS IMMORTALITY
ALIVE TO THE LUSTRE OF THE WEARER'S RANK
FIT TO ENDURE THE RUB OF CHANGE AND TIME
A TISSUE MIXED OF THE SOUL'S RADIANT LIGHT
AND MATTER'S SUBSTANCE OF SIGN-BURDENED FORCE
IMAGINED VAINLY IN OUR MIND'S THIN AIR
AN ABSTRACT PHANTASM MOULD OF MENTAL MAKE
IT FEELS WHAT EARTHLY BODIES CANNOT FEEL
AND IS MORE REAL THAN THIS GROSSER FRAME
AFTER THE FALLING OF MORTALITY'S CLOAK
LIGHTENED IS ITS WEIGHT TO HEIGHTEN ITS ASCENT
REFINED TO THE TOUCH OF FINER ENVIRONMENTS
IT DROPS OLD PATTERNED PALLS OF DENSER STUFF
CANCELS THE GRIP OF EARTH'S DESCENDING PULL
AND BEARS THE SOUL FROM WORLD TO HIGHER WORLD
106
TILL IN THE NAKED ETHER OF THE PEAKS
THE SPIRIT'S SIMPLICITY ALONE IS LEFT
THE ETERNAL BEING'S FIRST TRANSPARENT ROBE
BUT WHEN IT MUST COME BACK TO ITS MORTAL LOAD
AND THE HARD ENSEMBLE OF EARTH'S EXPERIENCE
THEN ITS RETURN RESUMES THAT HEAVIER DRESS
FOR LONG BEFORE EARTH'S SOLID VEST WAS FORGED
BY THE TECHNIQUE OF THE ATOMIC VOID
A LUCENT ENVELOPE OF SELF-DISGUISE
WAS WOVEN ROUND THE SECRET SPIRIT IN THINGS
THE SUBTLE REALMS FROM THOSE BRIGHT SHEATHS ARE MADE
THIS WONDER-WORLD WITH ALL ITS RADIANT BOON
OF VISION AND INVIOLATE HAPPINESS
ONLY FOR EXPRESSION CARES AND PERFECT FORM
FAIR ON ITS PEAKS IT HAS DANGEROUS NETHER PLANES
ITS LIGHT DRAWS TOWARDS THE VERGE OF NATURE'S LAPSE
IT LENDS BEAUTY TO THE TERROR OF THE GULFS
AND FASCINATING EYES TO PERILOUS GODS
INVESTS WITH GRACE THE DEMON AND THE SNAKE
ITS TRANCE IMPOSES EARTH'S INCONSCIENCE
IMMORTAL IT WEAVES FOR US DEATH'S SOMBRE ROBE
AND AUTHORISES OUR MORTALITY
THIS MEDIUM SERVES A GREATER CONSCIOUSNESS
A VESSEL OF ITS CONCEALED AUTOCRACY
IT IS THE SUBTLE GROUND OF MATTER'S WORLDS
IT IS THE IMMUTABLE IN THEIR MUTABLE FORMS
IN THE FOLDS OF ITS CREATIVE MEMORY
IT GUARDS THE DEATHLESS TYPE OF PERISHING THINGS
ITS LOWERED POTENCIES FOUND OUR FALLEN STRENGTHS
ITS THOUGHT INVENTS OUR REASONED IGNORANCE
ITS SENSE FATHERS OUR BODY'S REFLEXES
OUR SECRET BREATH OF UNTRIED MIGHTIER FORCE
THE LURKING SUN OF AN INSTANT'S INNER SIGHT
ITS FINE SUGGESTIONS ARE A COVERT FOUNT
FOR OUR IRIDESCENT RICH IMAGININGS
TOUCHING THINGS COMMON WITH TRANSFIGURING HUES
107
TILL EVEN EARTH'S MUD GROWS RICH AND WARM WITH THE SKIES
AND A GLORY GLEAMS FROM THE SOUL'S DECADENCE
ITS KNOWLEDGE IS OUR ERROR'S STARTING-POINT
ITS BEAUTY DONS OUR MUD-MASK UGLINESS
ITS ARTIST GOOD BEGINS OUR EVIL'S TALE
A HEAVEN OF CREATIVE TRUTHS ABOVE
A COSMOS OF HARMONIOUS DREAMS BETWEEN
A CHAOS OF DISSOLVING FORMS BELOW
IT PLUNGES LOST IN OUR INCONSCIENT BASE
OUT OF ITS FALL OUR DENSER MATTER CAME
THUS TAKEN WAS GOD'S PLUNGE INTO THE NIGHT
THIS FALLEN WORLD BECAME A NURSE OF SOULS
INHABITED BY CONCEALED DIVINITY
A BEING WOKE AND LIVED IN THE MEANINGLESS VOID
A WORLD-WIDE NESCIENCE STROVE TOWARDS LIFE AND THOUGHT
A CONSCIOUSNESS PLUCKED OUT FROM MINDLESS SLEEP
ALL HERE IS DRIVEN BY AN INSENTIENT WILL
THUS FALLEN INCONSCIENT FRUSTRATE DENSE INERT
SUNK INTO INANIMATE AND TORPID DROWSE
EARTH LAY A DRUDGE OF SLEEP FORCED TO CREATE
BY A SUBCONSCIENT YEARNING MEMORY
LEFT FROM A HAPPINESS DEAD BEFORE SHE WAS BORN
AN ALIEN WONDER ON HER SENSELESS BREAST
THIS MIRE MUST HARBOUR THE ORCHID AND THE ROSE
FROM HER BLIND UNWILLING SUBSTANCE MUST EMERGE
A BEAUTY THAT BELONGS TO HAPPIER SPHERES
THIS IS THE DESTINY BEQUEATHED TO HER
AS IF A SLAIN GOD LEFT A GOLDEN TRUST
TO A BLIND FORCE AND AN IMPRISONED SOUL
AN IMMORTAL GODHEAD'S PERISHABLE PARTS
SHE MUST RECONSTITUTE FROM FRAGMENTS LOST
REWORD FROM A DOCUMENT COMPLETE ELSEWHERE
HER DOUBTFUL TITLE TO HER DIVINE NAME
A RESIDUE HER SOLE INHERITANCE
ALL THINGS SHE CARRIES IN HER SHAPELESS DUST
108
HER GIANT ENERGY TIED TO PETTY FORMS
IN THE SLOW TENTATIVE MOTION OF HER POWER
WITH ONLY FRAIL BLUNT INSTRUMENTS FOR USE
SHE HAS ACCEPTED AS HER NATURE'S NEED
AND GIVEN TO MAN AS HIS STUPENDOUS WORK
A LABOUR TO THE GODS IMPOSSIBLE
A LIFE LIVING HARDLY IN A FIELD OF DEATH
ITS PORTION CLAIMS OF IMMORTALITY
A BRUTE HALF-CONSCIOUS BODY SERVES AS MEANS
A MIND THAT MUST RECOVER A KNOWLEDGE LOST
HELD IN STONE GRIP BY THE WORLD'S INCONSCIENCE
AND WEARING STILL THESE COUNTLESS KNOTS OF LAW
A SPIRIT BOUND STAND UP AS NATURE'S KING
A MIGHTY KINSHIP IS THIS DARING'S CAUSE
ALL WE ATTEMPT IN THIS IMPERFECT WORLD
LOOKS FORWARD OR LOOKS BACK BEYOND TIME'S GLOSS
TO ITS PURE IDEA AND FIRM INVIOLATE TYPE
IN AN ABSOLUTE CREATION'S FLAWLESS SKILL
TO SEIZE THE ABSOLUTE IN SHAPES THAT PASS
TO FIX THE ETERNAL'S TOUCH IN TIME-MADE THINGS
THIS IS THE LAW OF ALL PERFECTION HERE
A FRAGMENT HERE IS CAUGHT OF HEAVEN'S DESIGN
ELSE COULD WE NEVER HOPE FOR GREATER LIFE
AND ECSTASY AND GLORY COULD NOT BE
EVEN IN THE LITTLENESS OF OUR MORTAL STATE
EVEN IN THIS PRISON-HOUSE OF OUTER FORM
A BRILLIANT PASSAGE FOR THE INFALLIBLE FLAME
IS DRIVEN THROUGH GROSS WALLS OF NERVE AND BRAIN
A SPLENDOUR PRESSES OR A POWER BREAKS THROUGH
EARTH'S GREAT DULL BARRIER IS REMOVED AWHILE
THE INCONSCIENT SEAL IS LIFTED FROM OUR EYES
AND WE GROW VESSELS OF CREATIVE MIGHT
THE ENTHUSIASM OF A DIVINE SURPRISE
PERVADES OUR LIFE A MYSTIC STIR IS FELT
A JOYFUL ANGUISH TREMBLES IN OUR LIMBS
A DREAM OF BEAUTY DANCES THROUGH THE HEART
109
A THOUGHT FROM THE ETERNAL MIND DRAWS NEAR
INTIMATIONS CAST FROM THE INVISIBLE
AWAKING FROM INFINITY'S SLEEP COME DOWN
SYMBOLS OF THAT WHICH NEVER YET WAS MADE
BUT SOON THE INERT FLESH RESPONDS NO MORE
THEN SINKS THE SACRED ORGY OF DELIGHT
THE BLAZE OF PASSION AND THE TIDE OF POWER
ARE TAKEN FROM US AND THOUGH A GLOWING FORM
ABIDES ASTONISHING EARTH IMAGINED SUPREME
TOO LITTLE OF WHAT WAS MEANT HAS LEFT A TRACE
EARTH'S EYES HALF-SEE HER FORCES HALF-CREATE
HER RAREST WORKS ARE COPIES OF HEAVEN'S ART
A RADIANCE OF A GOLDEN ARTIFICE
A MASTERPIECE OF INSPIRED DEVICE AND RULE
HER FORMS HIDE WHAT THEY HOUSE AND ONLY MIME
THE UNSEIZED MIRACLE OF SELF-BORN SHAPES
THAT LIVE FOR EVER IN THE ETERNAL'S GAZE
HERE IN A DIFFICULT HALF-FINISHED WORLD
IS A SLOW TOILING OF UNCONSCIOUS POWERS
HERE IS MAN'S IGNORANT DIVINING MIND
HIS GENIUS BORN FROM AN INCONSCIENT SOIL
TO COPY ON EARTH'S COPIES IS HIS ART
FOR WHEN HE STRIVES FOR THINGS SURPASSING EARTH
TOO RUDE THE WORKMAN'S TOOLS TOO CRUDE HIS STUFF
AND HARDLY WITH HIS HEART'S BLOOD HE ACHIEVES
HIS TRANSIENT HOUSE OF THE DIVINE IDEA
HIS FIGURE OF A TIME-INN FOR THE UNBORN
OUR BEING THRILLS WITH HIGH FAR MEMORIES
AND WOULD BRING DOWN THEIR DATELESS MEANINGS HERE
BUT TOO DIVINE FOR EARTHLY NATURE'S SCHEME
BEYOND OUR REACH THE ETERNAL MARVELS BLAZE
ABSOLUTE THEY DWELL UNBORN IMMUTABLE
IMMACULATE IN THE SPIRIT'S DEATHLESS AIR
IMMORTAL IN A WORLD OF MOTIONLESS TIME
AND AN UNCHANGING MUSE OF DEEP SELF-SPACE
ONLY WHEN WE HAVE CLIMBED ABOVE OURSELVES
110
A LINE OF THE TRANSCENDENT MEETS OUR ROAD
AND JOINS US TO THE TIMELESS AND THE TRUE
IT BRINGS TO US THE INEVITABLE WORD
THE GODLIKE ACT THE THOUGHTS THAT NEVER DIE
A RIPPLE OF LIGHT AND GLORY WRAPS THE BRAIN
AND TRAVELLING DOWN THE MOMENT'S VANISHING ROUTE
THE FIGURES OF ETERNITY ARRIVE
AS THE MIND'S VISITORS OR THE HEART'S GUESTS
THEY ESPOUSE OUR MORTAL BREVITY AWHILE
OR SELDOM IN SOME RARE DELIVERING GLIMPSE
ARE CAUGHT BY OUR VISION'S DELICATE SURMISE
ALTHOUGH BEGINNINGS ONLY AND FIRST ATTEMPTS
THESE GLIMMERINGS POINT TO THE SECRET OF OUR BIRTH
AND THE HIDDEN MIRACLE OF OUR DESTINY
WHAT WE ARE THERE AND HERE ON EARTH SHALL BE
IS IMAGED IN A CONTACT AND A CALL
AS YET EARTH'S IMPERFECTION IS OUR SPHERE
OUR NATURE'S GLASS SHOWS NOT OUR REAL SELF
THAT GREATNESS STILL ABIDES HELD BACK WITHIN
EARTH'S DOUBTING FUTURE HIDES OUR HERITAGE
THE LIGHT NOW DISTANT SHALL GROW NATIVE HERE
THE STRENGTH THAT VISITS US OUR COMRADE POWER
THE INEFFABLE SHALL FIND A SECRET VOICE
THE IMPERISHABLE BURN THROUGH MATTER'S SCREEN
MAKING THIS MORTAL BODY GODHEAD'S ROBE
THE SPIRIT'S GREATNESS IS OUR TIMELESS SOURCE
AND IT SHALL BE OUR CROWN IN ENDLESS TIME
A VAST UNKNOWN IS ROUND US AND WITHIN
ALL THINGS ARE WRAPPED IN THE DYNAMIC ONE
A SUBTLE LINK OF UNION JOINS ALL LIFE
THUS ALL CREATION IS A SINGLE CHAIN
WE ARE NOT LEFT ALONE IN A CLOSED SCHEME
BETWEEN A DRIVING OF INCONSCIENT FORCE
AND AN INCOMMUNICABLE ABSOLUTE
OUR LIFE IS A SPUR IN A SUBLIME SOUL-RANGE
OUR BEING LOOKS BEYOND ITS WALLS OF MIND
111
AND IT COMMUNICATES WITH GREATER WORLDS
THERE ARE BRIGHTER EARTHS AND WIDER HEAVENS THAN OURS
THERE ARE REALMS WHERE BEING BROODS IN ITS OWN DEPTHS
IT FEELS IN ITS IMMENSE DYNAMIC CORE
ITS NAMELESS UNFORMED UNBORN POTENCIES
CRY FOR EXPRESSION IN THE UNSHAPED VAST
INEFFABLE BEYOND IGNORANCE AND DEATH
THE IMAGES OF ITS EVERLASTING TRUTH
LOOK OUT FROM A CHAMBER OF ITS SELF-RAPT SOUL
AS IF TO ITS OWN INNER WITNESS GAZE
THE SPIRIT HOLDS UP ITS MIRRORED SELF AND WORKS
THE POWER AND PASSION OF ITS TIMELESS HEART
THE FIGURES OF ITS FORMLESS ECSTASY
THE GRANDEURS OF ITS MULTITUDINOUS MIGHT
THENCE COMES THE MYSTIC SUBSTANCE OF OUR SOULS
INTO THE PRODIGY OF OUR NATURE'S BIRTH
THERE IS THE UNFALLEN HEIGHT OF ALL WE ARE
AND DATELESS FOUNT OF ALL WE HOPE TO BE
ON EVERY PLANE THE HIERATIC POWER
INITIATE OF UNSPOKEN VERITIES
DREAMS TO TRANSCRIBE AND MAKE A PART OF LIFE
IN ITS OWN NATIVE STYLE AND LIVING TONGUE
SOME TRAIT OF THE PERFECTION OF THE UNBORN
SOME VISION SEEN IN THE OMNISCIENT LIGHT
SOME FAR TONE OF THE IMMORTAL RHAPSODIST VOICE
SOME RAPTURE OF THE ALL-CREATING BLISS
SOME FORM AND PLAN OF THE BEAUTY UNUTTERABLE
WORLDS ARE THERE NEARER TO THOSE ABSOLUTE REALMS
WHERE THE RESPONSE TO TRUTH IS SWIFT AND SURE
AND SPIRIT IS NOT HAMPERED BY ITS FRAME
AND HEARTS BY SHARP DIVISION SEIZED AND RENT
AND DELIGHT AND BEAUTY ARE INHABITANTS
AND LOVE AND SWEETNESS ARE THE LAW OF LIFE
A FINER SUBSTANCE IN A SUBTLER MOULD
EMBODIES THE DIVINITY EARTH BUT DREAMS
ITS STRENGTH CAN OVERTAKE JOY'S RUNNING FEET
112
OVERLEAPING THE FIXED HURDLES SET BY TIME
THE RAPID NET OF AN INTUITIVE CLASP
CAPTURES THE FUGITIVE HAPPINESS WE DESIRE
A NATURE LIFTED BY A LARGER BREATH
PLASTIC AND PASSIVE TO THE ALL-SHAPING FIRE
ANSWERS THE FLAMING GODHEAD'S CASUAL TOUCH
IMMUNE FROM OUR INERTIA OF RESPONSE
IT HEARS THE WORD TO WHICH OUR HEARTS ARE DEAF
ADOPTS THE SEEING OF IMMORTAL EYES
AND TRAVELLER ON THE ROADS OF LINE AND HUE
PURSUES THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY TO ITS HOME
THUS WE DRAW NEAR TO THE ALL-WONDERFUL
FOLLOWING HIS RAPTURE IN THINGS AS SIGN AND GUIDE
BEAUTY IS HIS FOOTPRINT SHOWING US WHERE HE HAS PASSED
LOVE IS HIS HEART-BEATS' RHYTHM IN MORTAL BREASTS
HAPPINESS THE SMILE ON HIS ADORABLE FACE
A COMMUNION OF SPIRITUAL ENTITIES
A GENIUS OF CREATIVE IMMANENCE
MAKES ALL CREATION DEEPLY INTIMATE
A FOURTH DIMENSION OF AESTHETIC SENSE
WHERE ALL IS IN OURSELVES OURSELVES IN ALL
TO THE COSMIC WIDENESS RE-ALIGNS OUR SOULS
A KINDLING RAPTURE JOINS THE SEER AND SEEN
THE CRAFTSMAN AND THE CRAFT GROWN INLY ONE
ACHIEVE PERFECTION BY THE MAGIC THROB
AND PASSION OF THEIR CLOSE IDENTITY
ALL THAT WE SLOWLY PIECE FROM GATHERED PARTS
OR BY LONG LABOUR STUMBLINGLY EVOLVE
IS THERE SELF-BORN BY ITS ETERNAL RIGHT
IN US TOO THE INTUITIVE FIRE CAN BURN
AN AGENT LIGHT IT IS COILED IN OUR FOLDED HEARTS
ON THE CELESTIAL LEVELS IS ITS HOME
DESCENDING IT CAN BRING THOSE HEAVENS HERE
BUT RARELY BURNS THE FLAME NOR BURNS FOR LONG
THE JOY IT CALLS FROM THOSE DIVINER HEIGHTS
BRINGS BRIEF MAGNIFICENT REMINISCENCES
113
AND HIGH SPLENDID GLIMPSES OF INTERPRETING THOUGHT
BUT NOT THE UTTER VISION AND DELIGHT
A VEIL IS KEPT SOMETHING IS STILL HELD BACK
LEST CAPTIVES OF THE BEAUTY AND THE JOY
OUR SOULS FORGET TO THE HIGHEST TO ASPIRE
IN THAT FAIR SUBTLE REALM BEHIND OUR OWN
THE FORM IS ALL AND PHYSICAL GODS ARE KINGS
THE INSPIRING LIGHT PLAYS IN FINE BOUNDARIES
A FAULTLESS BEAUTY COMES BY NATURE'S GRACE
THERE LIBERTY IS PERFECTION'S GUARANTEE
ALTHOUGH THE ABSOLUTE IMAGE LACKS THE WORD
INCARNATE THE SHEER SPIRITUAL ECSTASY
ALL IS A MIRACLE OF SYMMETRIC CHARM
A FANTASY OF PERFECT LINE AND RULE
THERE ALL FEEL SATISFIED IN THEMSELVES AND WHOLE
A RICH COMPLETENESS IS BY LIMIT MADE
MARVEL IN AN UTTER LITTLENESS ABOUNDS
AN INTRICATE RAPTURE RIOTS IN A SMALL SPACE
EACH RHYTHM IS KIN TO ITS ENVIRONMENT
EACH LINE IS PERFECT AND INEVITABLE
EACH OBJECT FAULTLESSLY BUILT FOR CHARM AND USE
ALL IS ENAMOURED OF ITS OWN DELIGHT
INTACT IT LIVES OF ITS PERFECTION SURE
IN A HEAVEN-PLEASED SELF-GLAD IMMUNITY
CONTENT TO BE IT HAS NEED OF NOTHING MORE
HERE WAS NOT FUTILE EFFORT'S BROKEN HEART
EXEMPT FROM THE ORDEAL AND THE TEST
EMPTY OF OPPOSITION AND OF PAIN
IT WAS A WORLD THAT COULD NOT FEAR NOR GRIEVE
IT HAD NO GRACE OF ERROR OR DEFEAT
IT HAD NO ROOM FOR FAULT NO POWER TO FAIL
OUT OF SOME PACKED SELF-BLISS IT DREW AT ONCE
ITS FORM-DISCOVERIES OF THE MUTE IDEA
AND THE MIRACLE OF ITS RHYTHMIC THOUGHTS AND ACTS
ITS CLEAR TECHNIQUE OF FIRM AND ROUNDED LIVES
114
ITS GRACIOUS PEOPLE OF INANIMATE SHAPES
AND GLORY OF BREATHING BODIES LIKE OUR OWN
AMAZED HIS SENSES RAVISHED WITH DELIGHT
HE MOVED IN A DIVINE YET KINDRED WORLD
ADMIRING MARVELLOUS FORMS SO NEAR TO OURS
YET PERFECT LIKE THE PLAYTHINGS OF A GOD
DEATHLESS IN THE ASPECT OF MORTALITY
IN THEIR NARROW AND EXCLUSIVE ABSOLUTES
THE FINITE'S RANKED SUPREMACIES THRONED ABIDE
IT DREAMS NOT EVER OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ONLY IN BOUNDARIES CAN THIS ABSOLUTE LIVE
IN A SUPREMENESS BOUND TO ITS OWN PLAN
WHERE ALL WAS FINISHED AND NO WIDTHS WERE LEFT
NO SPACE FOR SHADOWS OF THE IMMEASURABLE
NO ROOM FOR THE INCALCULABLE'S SURPRISE
A CAPTIVE OF ITS OWN BEAUTY AND ECSTASY
IN A MAGIC CIRCLE WROUGHT THE ENCHANTED MIGHT
THE SPIRIT STOOD BACK EFFACED BEHIND ITS FRAME
ADMIRED FOR THE BRIGHT FINALITY OF ITS LINES
A BLUE HORIZON LIMITED THE SOUL
THOUGHT MOVED IN LUMINOUS FACILITIES
THE OUTER IDEAL'S SHALLOWS ITS SWIM-RANGE
LIFE IN ITS BOUNDARIES LINGERED SATISFIED
WITH THE SMALL HAPPINESS OF THE BODY'S ACTS
ASSIGNED AS FORCE TO A BOUND CORNER-MIND
ATTACHED TO THE SAFE PAUCITY OF HER ROOM
SHE DID HER LITTLE WORKS AND PLAYED AND SLEPT
AND THOUGHT NOT OF A GREATER WORK UNDONE
FORGETFUL OF HER VIOLENT VAST DESIRES
FORGETFUL OF THE HEIGHTS TO WHICH SHE ROSE
HER WALK WAS FIXED WITHIN A RADIANT GROOVE
THE BEAUTIFUL BODY OF A SOUL AT EASE
LIKE ONE WHO LAUGHS IN SWEET AND SUNLIT GROVES
CHILDLIKE SHE SWUNG IN HER GOLD CRADLE OF JOY
THE SPACES' CALL REACHED NOT HER CHARMED ABODE
SHE HAD NO WINGS FOR WIDE AND DANGEROUS FLIGHT
115
SHE FACED NO PERIL OF SKY OR OF ABYSS
SHE KNEW NO VISTAS AND NO MIGHTY DREAMS
NO YEARNING FOR HER LOST INFINITUDES
A PERFECT PICTURE IN A PERFECT FRAME
THIS FAERY ARTISTRY COULD NOT KEEP HIS WILL
ONLY A MOMENT'S FINE RELEASE IT GAVE
A CARELESS HOUR WAS SPENT IN A SLIGHT BLISS
OUR SPIRIT TIRES OF BEING'S SURFACES
TRANSCENDED IS THE SPLENDOUR OF THE FORM
IT TURNS TO HIDDEN POWERS AND DEEPER STATES
SO NOW HE LOOKED BEYOND FOR GREATER LIGHT
HIS SOUL'S PEAK-CLIMB ABANDONING IN ITS REAR
THIS BRILLIANT COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE OF DAYS
HE LEFT THAT FINE MATERIAL PARADISE
HIS DESTINY LAY BEYOND IN LARGER SPACE
116
AN UNEVEN BROAD ASCENT NOW LURED HIS FEET
ANSWERING A GREATER NATURE'S TROUBLED CALL
HE CROSSED THE LIMITS OF EMBODIED MIND
AND ENTERED WIDE OBSCURE DISPUTED FIELDS
WHERE ALL WAS DOUBT AND CHANGE AND NOTHING SURE
A WORLD OF SEARCH AND TOIL WITHOUT REPOSE
AS ONE WHO MEETS THE FACE OF THE UNKNOWN
A QUESTIONER WITH NONE TO GIVE REPLY
ATTRACTED TO A PROBLEM NEVER SOLVED
ALWAYS UNCERTAIN OF THE GROUND HE TROD
ALWAYS DRAWN ON TO AN INCONSTANT GOAL
HE TRAVELLED THROUGH A LAND PEOPLED BY DOUBTS
IN SHIFTING CONFINES ON A QUAKING BASE
IN FRONT HE SAW A BOUNDARY EVER UNREACHED
AND THOUGHT HIMSELF AT EACH STEP NEARER NOW
A FAR RETREATING HORIZON OF MIRAGE
A VAGRANCY WAS THERE THAT BROOKED NO HOME
A JOURNEY OF COUNTLESS PATHS WITHOUT A CLOSE
NOTHING HE FOUND TO SATISFY HIS HEART
A TIRELESS WANDERING SOUGHT AND COULD NOT CEASE
THERE LIFE IS THE MANIFEST INCALCULABLE
A MOVEMENT OF UNQUIET SEAS A LONG
AND VENTUROUS LEAP OF SPIRIT INTO SPACE
A VEXED DISTURBANCE IN THE ETERNAL CALM
AN IMPULSE AND PASSION OF THE INFINITE
ASSUMING WHATEVER SHAPE HER FANCY WILLS
ESCAPED FROM THE RESTRAINT OF SETTLED FORMS
SHE HAS LEFT THE SAFETY OF THE TRIED AND KNOWN
UNSHEPHERDED BY THE FEAR THAT WALKS THROUGH TIME
UNDAUNTED BY FATE THAT DOGS AND CHANCE THAT SPRINGS
SHE ACCEPTS DISASTER AS A COMMON RISK
117
CARELESS OF SUFFERING HEEDLESS OF SIN AND FALL
SHE WRESTLES WITH DANGER AND DISCOVERY
IN THE UNEXPLORED EXPANSES OF THE SOUL
TO BE SEEMED ONLY A LONG EXPERIMENT
THE HAZARD OF A SEEKING IGNORANT FORCE
THAT TRIES ALL TRUTHS AND FINDING NONE SUPREME
MOVES ON UNSATISFIED UNSURE OF ITS END
AS SAW SOME INNER MIND SO LIFE WAS SHAPED
FROM THOUGHT TO THOUGHT SHE PASSED FROM PHASE TO PHASE
TORTURED BY HER OWN POWERS OR PROUD AND BLEST
NOW MASTER OF HERSELF NOW TOY AND SLAVE
A HUGE INCONSEQUENCE WAS HER ACTION'S LAW
AS IF ALL POSSIBILITY MUST BE DRAINED
AND ANGUISH AND BLISS WERE PASTIMES OF THE HEART
IN A GALLOP OF THUNDER-HOOVED VICISSITUDES
SHE SWEPT THROUGH THE RACE-FIELDS OF CIRCUMSTANCE
OR SWAYING SHE TOSSED BETWEEN HER HEIGHTS AND DEEPS
UPLIFTED OR BROKEN ON TIME'S INCONSTANT WHEEL
AMID A TEDIOUS CRAWL OF DRAB DESIRES
SHE WRITHED A WORM MID WORMS IN NATURE'S MUD
THEN TITAN-STATURED TOOK ALL EARTH FOR FOOD
AMBITIONED THE SEAS FOR ROBE FOR CROWN THE STARS
AND SHOUTING STRODE FROM PEAK TO GIANT PEAK
CLAMOURING FOR WORLDS TO CONQUER AND TO RULE
THEN WANTONLY ENAMOURED OF SORROW'S FACE
SHE PLUNGED INTO THE ANGUISH OF THE DEPTHS
AND WALLOWING CLUNG TO HER OWN MISERY
IN DOLOROUS CONVERSE WITH HER SQUANDERED SELF
SHE WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT SHE HAD LOST
OR SAT WITH GRIEF AS WITH AN ANCIENT FRIEND
A ROMP OF VIOLENT RAPTURES SOON WAS SPENT
OR SHE LINGERED TIED TO AN INADEQUATE JOY
MISSING THE TURNS OF FATE MISSING LIFE'S GOAL
A SCENE WAS PLANNED FOR ALL HER NUMBERLESS MOODS
WHERE EACH COULD BE THE LAW AND WAY OF LIFE
BUT NONE COULD OFFER A PURE FELICITY
118
ONLY A FLICKERING ZEST THEY LEFT BEHIND
OR THE FIERCE LUST THAT BRINGS A DEAD FATIGUE
AMID HER SWIFT UNTOLD VARIETY
SOMETHING REMAINED DISSATISFIED EVER THE SAME
AND IN THE NEW SAW ONLY A FACE OF THE OLD
FOR EVERY HOUR REPEATED ALL THE REST
AND EVERY CHANGE PROLONGED THE SAME UNEASE
A SPIRIT OF HER SELF AND AIM UNSURE
TIRED SOON OF TOO MUCH JOY AND HAPPINESS
SHE NEEDS THE SPUR OF PLEASURE AND OF PAIN
AND THE NATIVE TASTE OF SUFFERING AND UNREST
SHE STRAINS FOR AN END THAT NEVER CAN SHE WIN
A PERVERSE SAVOUR HAUNTS HER THIRSTING LIPS
FOR THE GRIEF SHE WEEPS WHICH CAME FROM HER OWN CHOICE
FOR THE PLEASURE YEARNS THAT RACKED WITH WOUNDS HER BREAST
ASPIRING TO HEAVEN SHE TURNS HER STEPS TOWARDS HELL
CHANCE SHE HAS CHOSEN AND DANGER FOR PLAYFELLOWS
FATE'S DREADFUL SWING SHE HAS TAKEN FOR CRADLE AND SEAT
YET PURE AND BRIGHT FROM THE TIMELESS WAS HER BIRTH
A LOST WORLD-RAPTURE LINGERS IN HER EYES
HER MOODS ARE FACES OF THE INFINITE
BEAUTY AND HAPPINESS ARE HER NATIVE RIGHT
AND ENDLESS BLISS IS HER ETERNAL HOME
THIS NOW REVEALED ITS ANTIQUE FACE OF JOY
A SUDDEN DISCLOSURE TO THE HEART OF GRIEF
TEMPTING IT TO ENDURE AND LONG AND HOPE
EVEN IN CHANGING WORLDS BEREFT OF PEACE
IN AN AIR RACKED WITH SORROW AND WITH FEAR
AND WHILE HIS FEET TROD ON A SOIL UNSAFE
HE SAW THE IMAGE OF A HAPPIER STATE
IN AN ARCHITECTURE OF HIERATIC SPACE
CIRCLING AND MOUNTING TOWARDS CREATION'S TOPS
AT A BLUE HEIGHT WHICH NEVER WAS TOO HIGH
FOR WARM COMMUNION BETWEEN BODY AND SOUL
AS FAR AS HEAVEN AS NEAR AS THOUGHT AND HOPE
119
GLIMMERED THE KINGDOM OF A GRIEFLESS LIFE
ABOVE HIM IN A NEW CELESTIAL VAULT
OTHER THAN THE HEAVENS BEHELD BY MORTAL EYES
AS ON A FRETTED CEILING OF THE GODS
AN ARCHIPELAGO OF LAUGHTER AND FIRE
SWAM STARS APART IN A RIPPLED SEA OF SKY
TOWERED SPIRALS MAGIC RINGS OF VIVID HUE
AND GLEAMING SPHERES OF STRANGE FELICITY
FLOATED THROUGH DISTANCE LIKE A SYMBOL WORLD
ON THE TROUBLE AND THE TOIL THEY COULD NOT SHARE
ON THE UNHAPPINESS THEY COULD NOT AID
IMPERVIOUS TO LIFE'S SUFFERING STRUGGLE GRIEF
UNTARNISHED BY ITS ANGER GLOOM AND HATE
UNMOVED UNTOUCHED LOOKED DOWN GREAT VISIONED PLANES
BLISSFUL FOR EVER IN THEIR TIMELESS RIGHT
ABSORBED IN THEIR OWN BEAUTY AND CONTENT
OF THEIR IMMORTAL GLADNESS THEY LIVE SURE
APART IN THEIR SELF-GLORY PLUNGED REMOTE
BURNING THEY SWAM IN A VAGUE LUCENT HAZE
AN EVERLASTING REFUGE OF DREAM-LIGHT
A NEBULA OF THE SPLENDOURS OF THE GODS
MADE FROM THE MUSINGS OF ETERNITY
ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE BY HUMAN FAITH
HARDLY THEY SEEMED THE STUFF OF THINGS THAT ARE
AS THROUGH A MAGIC TELEVISION'S GLASS
OUTLINED TO SOME MAGNIFYING INNER EYE
THEY SHONE LIKE IMAGES THROWN FROM A FAR SCENE
TOO HIGH AND GLAD FOR MORTAL LIDS TO SEIZE
BUT NEAR AND REAL TO THE LONGING HEART
AND TO THE BODY'S PASSIONATE THOUGHT AND SENSE
ARE THE HIDDEN KINGDOMS OF BEATITUDE
IN SOME CLOSE UNATTAINED REALM WHICH YET WE FEEL
IMMUNE FROM THE HARSH CLUTCH OF DEATH AND TIME
ESCAPING THE SEARCH OF SORROW AND DESIRE
IN BRIGHT ENCHANTED SAFE PERIPHERIES
FOR EVER WALLOWING IN BLISS THEY LIE
120
IN DREAM AND TRANCE AND MUSE BEFORE OUR EYES
ACROSS A SUBTLE VISION'S INNER FIELD
WIDE RAPTUROUS LANDSCAPES FLEETING FROM THE SIGHT
THE FIGURES OF THE PERFECT KINGDOM PASS
AND BEHIND THEM LEAVE A SHINING MEMORY'S TRAIL
IMAGINED SCENES OR GREAT ETERNAL WORLDS
DREAM-CAUGHT OR SENSED THEY TOUCH OUR HEARTS WITH THEIR DEPTHS
UNREAL-SEEMING YET MORE REAL THAN LIFE
HAPPIER THAN HAPPINESS TRUER THAN THINGS TRUE
IF DREAMS THESE WERE OR CAPTURED IMAGES
DREAM'S TRUTH MADE FALSE EARTH'S VAIN REALITIES
IN A SWIFT ETERNAL MOMENT FIXED THERE LIVE
OR EVER RECALLED COME BACK TO LONGING EYES
CALM HEAVENS OF IMPERISHABLE LIGHT
ILLUMINED CONTINENTS OF VIOLET PEACE
OCEANS AND RIVERS OF THE MIRTH OF GOD
AND GRIEFLESS COUNTRIES UNDER PURPLE SUNS
THIS ONCE A STAR OF BRIGHT REMOTE IDEA
OR IMAGINATION'S COMET TRAIL OF DREAM
TOOK NOW A CLOSE SHAPE OF REALITY
THE GULF BETWEEN DREAM-TRUTH EARTH-FACT WAS CROSSED
THE WONDER-WORLDS OF LIFE WERE DREAMS NO MORE
HIS VISION MADE ALL THEY UNVEILED ITS OWN
THEIR SCENES THEIR HAPPENINGS MET HIS EYES AND HEART
AND SMOTE THEM WITH PURE LOVELINESS AND BLISS
A BREATHLESS SUMMIT REGION DREW HIS GAZE
WHOSE BOUNDARIES JUTTED INTO A SKY OF SELF
AND DIPPED TOWARDS A STRANGE ETHEREAL BASE
THE QUINTESSENCE GLOWED OF LIFE'S SUPREME DELIGHT
ON A SPIRITUAL AND MYSTERIOUS PEAK
ONLY A MIRACLE'S HIGH TRANSFIGURING LINE
DIVIDED LIFE FROM THE FORMLESS INFINITE
AND SHELTERED TIME AGAINST ETERNITY
OUT OF THAT FORMLESS STUFF TIME MINTS HIS SHAPES
THE ETERNAL'S QUIET HOLDS THE COSMIC ACT
121
THE PROTEAN IMAGES OF THE WORLD-FORCE
HAVE DRAWN THE STRENGTH TO BE THE WILL TO LAST
FROM A DEEP OCEAN OF DYNAMIC PEACE
INVERTING THE SPIRIT'S APEX TOWARDS LIFE
SHE SPENDS THE PLASTIC LIBERTIES OF THE ONE
TO CAST IN ACTS THE DREAMS OF HER CAPRICE
HIS WISDOM'S CALL STEADIES HER CARELESS FEET
HE PROPS HER DANCE UPON A RIGID BASE
HIS TIMELESS STILL IMMUTABILITY
MUST STANDARDISE HER CREATION'S MIRACLE
OUT OF THE VOID'S UNSEEING ENERGIES
INVENTING THE SCENE OF A CONCRETE UNIVERSE
BY HIS THOUGHT SHE HAS FIXED ITS PACES IN ITS BLIND ACTS
SHE SEES BY FLASHES OF HIS ALL-KNOWING LIGHT
AT HER WILL THE INSCRUTABLE SUPERMIND LEANS DOWN
TO GUIDE HER FORCE THAT FEELS BUT CANNOT KNOW
ITS BREATH OF POWER CONTROLS HER RESTLESS SEAS
AND LIFE OBEYS THE GOVERNING IDEA
AT HER WILL LED BY A LUMINOUS IMMANENCE
THE HAZARDOUS EXPERIMENTING MIND
PUSHES ITS WAY THROUGH OBSCURE POSSIBLES
MID CHANCE FORMATIONS OF AN UNKNOWING WORLD
OUR HUMAN IGNORANCE MOVES TOWARDS THE TRUTH
THAT NESCIENCE MAY BECOME OMNISCIENT
TRANSMUTED INSTINCTS SHAPE TO DIVINE THOUGHTS
THOUGHTS HOUSE INFALLIBLE IMMORTAL SIGHT
AND NATURE CLIMB TOWARDS GOD'S IDENTITY
THE MASTER OF THE WORLDS SELF-MADE HER SLAVE
IS THE EXECUTOR OF HER FANTASIES
SHE HAS CANALISED THE SEAS OF OMNIPOTENCE
SHE HAS LIMITED BY HER LAWS THE ILLIMITABLE
THE IMMORTAL BOUND HIMSELF TO DO HER WORKS
HE LABOURS AT THE TASKS HER IGNORANCE SETS
HIDDEN IN THE CAPE OF OUR MORTALITY
THE WORLDS THE FORMS HER GODDESS FANCY MAKES
HAVE LOST THEIR ORIGIN ON UNSEEN HEIGHTS
122
EVEN SEVERED STRAYING FROM THEIR TIMELESS SOURCE
EVEN DEFORMED OBSCURE ACCURSED AND FALLEN
SINCE EVEN FALL HAS ITS PERVERTED JOY
AND NOTHING SHE LEAVES OUT THAT SERVES DELIGHT
THESE TOO CAN TO THE PEAKS REVERT OR HERE
CUT OUT THE SENTENCE OF THE SPIRIT'S FALL
RECOVER THEIR FORFEITED DIVINITY
AT ONCE CAUGHT IN AN ETERNAL VISION'S SWEEP
HE SAW HER PRIDE AND SPLENDOUR OF HIGHBORN ZONES
AND HER REGIONS CROUCHING IN THE NETHER DEEPS
ABOVE WAS A MONARCHY OF UNFALLEN SELF
BENEATH WAS THE GLOOMY TRANCE OF THE ABYSS
AN OPPOSITE POLE OR DIM ANTIPODES
THERE WERE VASTS OF THE GLORY OF LIFE'S ABSOLUTES
ALL LAUGHED IN A SAFE IMMORTALITY
AND AN ETERNAL CHILDHOOD OF THE SOUL
BEFORE DARKNESS CAME AND PAIN AND GRIEF WERE BORN
WHERE ALL COULD DARE TO BE THEMSELVES AND ONE
AND WISDOM PLAYED IN SINLESS INNOCENCE
WITH NAKED FREEDOM IN TRUTH'S HAPPY SUN
THERE WERE WORLDS OF HER LAUGHTER AND DREADFUL IRONY
THERE WERE FIELDS OF HER TASTE OF TOIL AND STRIFE AND TEARS
HER HEAD LAY ON THE BREAST OF AMOROUS DEATH
SLEEP IMITATED AWHILE EXTINCTION'S PEACE
THE LIGHT OF GOD SHE HAS PARTED FROM HIS DARK
TO TEST THE SAVOUR OF BARE OPPOSITES
HERE MINGLING IN MAN'S HEART THEIR TONES AND HUES
HAVE WOVEN HIS BEING'S MUTABLE DESIGN
HIS LIFE A FORWARD-RIPPLING STREAM IN TIME
HIS NATURE'S CONSTANT FIXED MOBILITY
HIS SOUL A MOVING PICTURE'S CHANGEFUL FILM
HIS COSMOS-CHAOS OF PERSONALITY
THE GRAND CREATRIX WITH HER CRYPTIC TOUCH
HAS TURNED TO PATHOS AND POWER BEING'S SELF-DREAM
MADE A PASSION-PLAY OF ITS FATHOMLESS MYSTERY
123
BUT HERE WERE WORLDS LIFTED HALF-WAY TO HEAVEN
THE VEIL WAS THERE BUT NOT THE SHADOWY WALL
IN FORMS NOT TOO REMOTE FROM HUMAN GRASP
SOME PASSION OF THE INVIOLATE PURITY
BROKE THROUGH A RAY OF THE ORIGINAL BLISS
HEAVEN'S JOYS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EARTH'S IF EARTH WERE PURE
THERE COULD HAVE REACHED OUR DIVINISED SENSE AND HEART
SOME NATURAL FELICITY'S BRIGHT EXTREME
SOME THRILL OF SUPERNATURE'S ABSOLUTES
ALL STRENGTHS COULD LAUGH AND SPORT ON EARTH'S HARD ROADS
AND NEVER FEEL HER CRUEL EDGE OF PAIN
ALL LOVE COULD PLAY AND NOWHERE NATURE'S SHAME
BUT SHE HAS STABLED HER DREAMS IN MATTER'S COURTS
AND STILL HER DOORS ARE BARRED TO THINGS SUPREME
THESE WORLDS COULD FEEL GOD'S BREATH VISITING THEIR TOPS
SOME GLIMMER OF THE TRANSCENDENT'S HEM WAS THERE
ACROSS THE WHITE AEONIC SILENCES
IMMORTAL FIGURES OF EMBODIED JOY
TRAVERSED WIDE SPACES NEAR TO ETERNITY'S SLEEP
PURE MYSTIC VOICES IN BEATITUDE'S HUSH
APPEALED TO LOVE'S IMMACULATE SWEETNESSES
CALLING HIS HONEYED TOUCH TO THRILL THE WORLDS
HIS BLISSFUL HANDS TO SEIZE ON NATURE'S LIMBS
HIS SWEET INTOLERANT MIGHT OF UNION
TO TAKE ALL BEINGS INTO HIS SAVIOUR ARMS
DRAWING TO HIS PITY THE REBEL AND THE WAIF
TO FORCE ON THEM THE HAPPINESS THEY REFUSE
A CHANT HYMENEAL TO THE UNSEEN DIVINE
A FLAMING RHAPSODY OF WHITE DESIRE
LURED AN IMMORTAL MUSIC INTO THE HEART
AND WOKE THE SLUMBERING EAR OF ECSTASY
A PURER FIERIER SENSE HAD THERE ITS HOME
A BURNING URGE NO EARTHLY LIMBS CAN HOLD
ONE DREW A LARGE UNBURDENED SPACIOUS BREATH
AND THE HEART SPED FROM BEAT TO RAPTUROUS BEAT
THE VOICE OF TIME SANG OF THE IMMORTAL'S JOY
124
AN INSPIRATION AND A LYRIC CRY
THE MOMENTS CAME WITH ECSTASY ON THEIR WINGS
BEAUTY UNIMAGINABLE MOVED HEAVEN-BARE
ABSOLVED FROM BOUNDARIES IN THE VASTS OF DREAM
THE CRY OF THE BIRDS OF WONDER CALLED FROM THE SKIES
TO THE DEATHLESS PEOPLE OF THE SHORES OF LIGHT
CREATION LEAPED STRAIGHT FROM THE HANDS OF GOD
MARVEL AND RAPTURE WANDERED IN THE WAYS
ONLY TO BE WAS A SUPREME DELIGHT
LIFE WAS A HAPPY LAUGHTER OF THE SOUL
AND JOY WAS KING WITH LOVE FOR MINISTER
THE SPIRIT'S LUMINOUSNESS WAS BODIED THERE
LIFE'S CONTRARIES WERE LOVERS OR NATURAL FRIENDS
AND HER EXTREMES KEEN EDGES OF HARMONY
INDULGENCE WITH A TENDER PURITY CAME
AND NURSED THE GOD ON HER MATERNAL BREAST
THERE NONE WAS WEAK SO FALSEHOOD COULD NOT LIVE
IGNORANCE WAS A THIN SHADE PROTECTING LIGHT
IMAGINATION THE FREE-WILL OF TRUTH
PLEASURE A CANDIDATE FOR HEAVEN'S FIRE
THE INTELLECT WAS BEAUTY'S WORSHIPPER
STRENGTH WAS THE SLAVE OF CALM SPIRITUAL LAW
POWER LAID ITS HEAD UPON THE BREASTS OF BLISS
THERE WERE SUMMIT-GLORIES INCONCEIVABLE
AUTONOMIES OF WISDOM'S STILL SELF-RULE
AND HIGH DEPENDENCIES OF HER VIRGIN SUN
ILLUMINED THEOCRACIES OF THE SEEING SOUL
THRONED IN THE POWER OF THE TRANSCENDENT'S RAY
A VISION OF GRANDEURS A DREAM OF MAGNITUDES
IN SUN-BRIGHT KINGDOMS MOVED WITH REGAL GAIT
ASSEMBLIES CROWDED SENATES OF THE GODS
LIFE'S PUISSANCES REIGNED ON SEATS OF MARBLE WILL
HIGH DOMINATIONS AND AUTOCRACIES
AND LAURELLED STRENGTHS AND ARMED IMPERATIVE MIGHTS
ALL OBJECTS THERE WERE GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL
ALL BEINGS WORE A ROYAL STAMP OF POWER
125
THERE SAT THE OLIGARCHIES OF NATURAL LAW
PROUD VIOLENT HEADS SERVED ONE CALM MONARCH BROW
ALL THE SOUL'S POSTURES DONNED DIVINITY
THERE MET THE ARDENT MUTUAL INTIMACIES
OF MASTERY'S JOY AND THE JOY OF SERVITUDE
IMPOSED BY LOVE ON LOVE'S HEART THAT OBEYS
AND LOVE'S BODY HELD BENEATH A RAPTUROUS YOKE
ALL WAS A GAME OF MEETING KINGLINESSES
FOR WORSHIP LIFTS THE WORSHIPPER'S BOWED STRENGTH
CLOSE TO THE GOD'S PRIDE AND BLISS HIS SOUL ADORES
THE RULER THERE IS ONE WITH ALL HE RULES
TO HIM WHO SERVES WITH A FREE EQUAL HEART
OBEDIENCE IS HIS PRINCELY TRAINING'S SCHOOL
HIS NOBILITY'S CORONET AND PRIVILEGE
HIS FAITH IS A HIGH NATURE'S IDIOM
HIS SERVICE A SPIRITUAL SOVEREIGNTY
THERE WERE REALMS WHERE KNOWLEDGE JOINED CREATIVE POWER
IN HER HIGH HOME AND MADE HER ALL HIS OWN
THE GRAND ILLUMINATE SEIZED HER GLEAMING LIMBS
AND FILLED THEM WITH THE PASSION OF HIS RAY
TILL ALL HER BODY WAS ITS TRANSPARENT HOUSE
AND ALL HER SOUL A COUNTERPART OF HIS SOUL
APOTHEOSISED TRANSFIGURED BY WISDOM'S TOUCH
HER DAYS BECAME A LUMINOUS SACRIFICE
AN IMMORTAL MOTH IN HAPPY AND ENDLESS FIRE
SHE BURNED IN HIS SWEET INTOLERABLE BLAZE
A CAPTIVE LIFE WEDDED HER CONQUEROR
IN HIS WIDE SKY SHE BUILT HER WORLD ANEW
SHE GAVE TO MIND'S CALM PACE THE MOTOR'S SPEED
TO THINKING A NEED TO LIVE WHAT THE SOUL SAW
TO LIVING AN IMPETUS TO KNOW AND SEE
HIS SPLENDOUR GRASPED HER HER PUISSANCE TO HIM CLUNG
SHE CROWNED THE IDEA A KING IN PURPLE ROBES
PUT HER MAGIC SERPENT SCEPTRE IN THOUGHT'S GRIP
MADE FORMS HIS INWARD VISION'S RHYTHMIC SHAPES
AND HER ACTS THE LIVING BODY OF HIS WILL
126
A FLAMING THUNDER A CREATOR FLASH
HIS VICTOR LIGHT RODE ON HER DEATHLESS FORCE
A CENTAUR'S MIGHTY GALLOP BORE THE GOD
LIFE THRONED WITH MIND A DOUBLE MAJESTY
WORLDS WERE THERE OF A HAPPINESS GREAT AND GRAVE
AND ACTION TINGED WITH DREAM LAUGHTER WITH THOUGHT
AND PASSION THERE COULD WAIT FOR ITS DESIRE
UNTIL IT HEARD THE NEAR APPROACH OF GOD
WORLDS WERE THERE OF A CHILDLIKE MIRTH AND JOY
A CAREFREE YOUTHFULNESS OF MIND AND HEART
FOUND IN THE BODY A HEAVENLY INSTRUMENT
IT LIT AN AUREATE HALO ROUND DESIRE
AND FREED THE DEIFIED ANIMAL IN THE LIMBS
TO DIVINE GAMBOLS OF LOVE AND BEAUTY AND BLISS
ON A RADIANT SOIL THAT GAZED AT HEAVEN'S SMILE
A SWIFT LIFE-IMPULSE STINTED NOT NOR STOPPED
IT KNEW NOT HOW TO TIRE HAPPY WERE ITS TEARS
THERE WORK WAS PLAY AND PLAY THE ONLY WORK
THE TASKS OF HEAVEN A GAME OF GODLIKE MIGHT
A CELESTIAL BACCHANAL FOR EVER PURE
UNSTAYED BY FAINTNESS AS IN MORTAL FRAMES
LIFE WAS AN ETERNITY OF RAPTURE'S MOODS
AGE NEVER CAME CARE NEVER LINED THE FACE
IMPOSING ON THE SAFETY OF THE STARS
A RACE AND LAUGHTER OF IMMORTAL STRENGTHS
THE NUDE GOD-CHILDREN IN THEIR PLAY-FIELDS RAN
SMITING THE WINDS WITH SPLENDOUR AND WITH SPEED
OF STORM AND SUN THEY MADE COMPANIONS
SPORTED WITH THE WHITE MANE OF TOSSING SEAS
SLEW DISTANCE TRAMPLED TO DEATH UNDER THEIR WHEELS
AND WRESTLED IN THE ARENAS OF THEIR FORCE
IMPERIOUS IN THEIR RADIANCE LIKE THE SUNS
THEY KINDLED HEAVEN WITH THE GLORY OF THEIR LIMBS
FLUNG LIKE A DIVINE LARGESS TO THE WORLD
A SPELL TO FORCE THE HEART TO STARK DELIGHT
THEY CARRIED THE PRIDE AND MASTERY OF THEIR CHARM
127
AS IF LIFE'S BANNER ON THE ROADS OF SPACE
IDEAS WERE LUMINOUS COMRADES OF THE SOUL
MIND PLAYED WITH SPEECH CAST JAVELINS OF THOUGHT
BUT NEEDED NOT THESE INSTRUMENTS' TOIL TO KNOW
KNOWLEDGE WAS NATURE'S PASTIME LIKE THE REST
INVESTITURED WITH THE FRESH HEART'S BRIGHT RAY
AN EARLY GOD-INSTINCT'S CHILD INHERITORS
TENANTS OF THE PERPETUITY OF TIME
STILL THRILLING WITH THE FIRST CREATION'S BLISS
THEY STEEPED EXISTENCE IN THEIR YOUTH OF SOUL
AN EXQUISITE AND VEHEMENT TYRANNY
THE STRONG COMPULSION OF THEIR WILL TO JOY
POURED SMILING STREAMS OF HAPPINESS THROUGH THE WORLD
THERE REIGNED A BREATH OF HIGH IMMUNE CONTENT
A FORTUNATE GAIT OF DAYS IN TRANQUIL AIR
A FLOOD OF UNIVERSAL LOVE AND PEACE
A SOVEREIGNTY OF TIRELESS SWEETNESS LIVED
LIKE A SONG OF PLEASURE ON THE LIPS OF TIME
A LARGE SPONTANEOUS ORDER FREED THE WILL
A SUN-FRANK WINGING OF THE SOUL TO BLISS
THE BREADTH AND GREATNESS OF THE UNFETTERED ACT
AND THE SWIFT FIRE-HEART'S GOLDEN LIBERTY
THERE WAS NO FALSEHOOD OF SOUL-SEVERANCE
THERE CAME NO CROOKEDNESS OF THOUGHT OR WORD
TO ROB CREATION OF ITS NATIVE TRUTH
ALL WAS SINCERITY AND NATURAL FORCE
THERE FREEDOM WAS SOLE RULE AND HIGHEST LAW
IN A HAPPY SERIES CLIMBED OR PLUNGED THESE WORLDS
IN REALMS OF CURIOUS BEAUTY AND SURPRISE
IN FIELDS OF GRANDEUR AND OF TITAN POWER
LIFE PLAYED AT EASE WITH HER IMMENSE DESIRES
A THOUSAND EDENS SHE COULD BUILD NOR PAUSE
NO BOUND WAS SET TO HER GREATNESS AND TO HER GRACE
AND TO HER HEAVENLY VARIETY
AWAKE WITH A CRY AND STIR OF NUMBERLESS SOULS
ARISEN FROM THE BREAST OF SOME DEEP INFINITE
128
SMILING LIKE A NEW-BORN CHILD AT LOVE AND HOPE
IN HER NATURE HOUSING THE IMMORTAL'S POWER
IN HER BOSOM BEARING THE ETERNAL WILL
NO GUIDE SHE NEEDED BUT HER LUMINOUS HEART
NO FALL DEBASED THE GODHEAD OF HER STEPS
NO ALIEN NIGHT HAD COME TO BLIND HER EYES
THERE WAS NO USE FOR GRUDGING RING OR FENCE
EACH ACT WAS A PERFECTION AND A JOY
ABANDONED TO HER RAPID FANCY'S MOODS
AND THE RICH COLOURED RIOT OF HER MIND
INITIATE OF DIVINE AND MIGHTY DREAMS
MAGICIAN BUILDER OF UNNUMBERED FORMS
EXPLORING THE MEASURES OF THE RHYTHMS OF GOD
AT WILL SHE WOVE HER WIZARD WONDER-DANCE
A DIONYSIAN GODDESS OF DELIGHT
A BACCHANT OF CREATIVE ECSTASY
THIS WORLD OF BLISS HE SAW AND FELT ITS CALL
BUT FOUND NO WAY TO ENTER INTO ITS JOY
ACROSS THE CONSCIOUS GULF THERE WAS NO BRIDGE
A DARKER AIR ENCIRCLED STILL HIS SOUL
TIED TO AN IMAGE OF UNQUIET LIFE
IN SPITE OF YEARNING MIND AND LONGING SENSE
TO A SAD THOUGHT BY GREY EXPERIENCE FORMED
AND A VISION DIMMED BY CARE AND SORROW AND SLEEP
ALL THIS SEEMED ONLY A BRIGHT DESIRABLE DREAM
CONCEIVED IN A LONGING DISTANCE BY THE HEART
OF ONE WHO WALKS IN THE SHADOW OF EARTH-PAIN
ALTHOUGH HE ONCE HAD FELT THE ETERNAL'S CLASP
TOO NEAR TO SUFFERING WORLDS HIS NATURE LIVED
AND WHERE HE STOOD WERE ENTRANCES OF NIGHT
HARDLY TOO CLOSE BESET BY THE WORLD'S CARE
CAN THE DENSE MOULD IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN MADE
RETURN SHEER JOY TO JOY PURE LIGHT TO LIGHT
FOR ITS TORMENTED WILL TO THINK AND LIVE
FIRST TO A MINGLED PAIN AND PLEASURE WOKE
129
AND STILL IT KEEPS THE HABIT OF ITS BIRTH
A DIRE DUALITY IS OUR WAY TO BE
IN THE CRUDE BEGINNINGS OF THIS MORTAL WORLD
LIFE WAS NOT NOR MIND'S PLAY NOR HEART'S DESIRE
WHEN EARTH WAS BUILT IN THE UNCONSCIOUS VOID
AND NOTHING WAS SAVE A MATERIAL SCENE
IDENTIFIED WITH SEA AND SKY AND STONE
HER YOUNG GODS YEARNED FOR THE RELEASE OF SOULS
ASLEEP IN OBJECTS VAGUE INANIMATE
IN THAT DESOLATE GRANDEUR IN THAT BEAUTY BARE
IN THE DEAF STILLNESS MID THE UNHEEDED SOUNDS
HEAVY WAS THE UNCOMMUNICATED LOAD
OF GODHEAD IN A WORLD THAT HAD NO NEEDS
FOR NONE WAS THERE TO FEEL OR TO RECEIVE
THIS SOLID MASS WHICH BROOKED NO THROB OF SENSE
COULD NOT CONTAIN THEIR VAST CREATIVE URGE
IMMERSED NO MORE IN MATTER'S HARMONY
THE SPIRIT LOST ITS STATUESQUE REPOSE
IN THE UNCARING TRANCE IT GROPED FOR SIGHT
PASSIONED FOR THE MOVEMENTS OF A CONSCIOUS HEART
FAMISHING FOR SPEECH AND THOUGHT AND JOY AND LOVE
IN THE DUMB INSENSITIVE WHEELING DAY AND NIGHT
HUNGERED FOR THE BEAT OF YEARNING AND RESPONSE
THE POISED INCONSCIENCE SHAKEN WITH A TOUCH
THE INTUITIVE SILENCE TREMBLING WITH A NAME
THEY CRIED TO LIFE TO INVADE THE SENSELESS MOULD
AND IN BRUTE FORMS AWAKE DIVINITY
A VOICE WAS HEARD ON THE MUTE ROLLING GLOBE
A MURMUR MOANED IN THE UNLISTENING VOID
A BEING SEEMED TO BREATHE WHERE ONCE WAS NONE
SOMETHING PENT UP IN DEAD INSENTIENT DEPTHS
DENIED CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE LOST TO JOY
TURNED AS IF ONE ASLEEP SINCE DATELESS TIME
AWARE OF ITS OWN BURIED REALITY
REMEMBERING ITS FORGOTTEN SELF AND RIGHT
IT YEARNED TO KNOW TO ASPIRE TO ENJOY TO LIVE
130
LIFE HEARD THE CALL AND LEFT HER NATIVE LIGHT
OVERFLOWING FROM HER BRIGHT MAGNIFICENT PLANE
ON THE RIGID COIL AND SPRAWL OF MORTAL SPACE
HERE TOO THE GRACIOUS GREAT-WINGED ANGEL POURED
HER SPLENDOUR AND HER SWIFTNESS AND HER BLISS
HOPING TO FILL A FAIR NEW WORLD WITH JOY
AS COMES A GODDESS TO A MORTAL'S BREAST
AND FILLS HIS DAYS WITH HER CELESTIAL CLASP
SHE STOOPED TO MAKE HER HOME IN TRANSIENT SHAPES
IN MATTER'S WOMB SHE CAST THE IMMORTAL'S FIRE
IN THE UNFEELING VAST WOKE THOUGHT AND HOPE
SMOTE WITH HER CHARM AND BEAUTY FLESH AND NERVE
AND FORCED DELIGHT ON EARTH'S INSENSIBLE FRAME
ALIVE AND CLAD WITH TREES AND HERBS AND FLOWERS
EARTH'S GREAT BROWN BODY SMILED TOWARDS THE SKIES
AZURE REPLIED TO AZURE IN THE SEA'S LAUGH
NEW SENTIENT CREATURES FILLED THE UNSEEN DEPTHS
LIFE'S GLORY AND SWIFTNESS RAN IN THE BEAUTY OF BEASTS
MAN DARED AND THOUGHT AND MET WITH HIS SOUL THE WORLD
BUT WHILE THE MAGIC BREATH WAS ON ITS WAY
BEFORE HER GIFTS COULD REACH OUR PRISONED HEARTS
A DARK AMBIGUOUS PRESENCE QUESTIONED ALL
THE SECRET WILL THAT ROBES ITSELF WITH NIGHT
AND OFFERS TO SPIRIT THE ORDEAL OF THE FLESH
IMPOSED A MYSTIC MASK OF DEATH AND PAIN
INTERNED NOW IN THE SLOW AND SUFFERING YEARS
SOJOURNS THE WINGED AND WONDERFUL WAYFARER
AND CAN NO MORE RECALL HER HAPPIER STATE
BUT MUST OBEY THE INERT INCONSCIENT'S LAW
INSENSIBLE FOUNDATION OF A WORLD
IN WHICH BLIND LIMITS ARE ON BEAUTY LAID
AND SORROW AND JOY AS STRUGGLING COMRADES LIVE
A DIM AND DREADFUL MUTENESS FELL ON HER
ABOLISHED WAS HER SUBTLE MIGHTY SPIRIT
AND SLAIN HER BOON OF CHILD-GOD HAPPINESS
AND ALL HER GLORY INTO LITTLENESS TURNED
131
AND ALL HER SWEETNESS INTO A MAIMED DESIRE
TO FEED DEATH WITH HER WORKS IS HERE LIFE'S DOOM
SO VEILED WAS HER IMMORTALITY THAT SHE SEEMED
INFLICTING CONSCIOUSNESS ON UNCONSCIOUS THINGS
AN EPISODE IN AN ETERNAL DEATH
A MYTH OF BEING THAT MUST FOR EVER CEASE
SUCH WAS THE EVIL MYSTERY OF HER CHANGE
132
A QUIVERING TREPIDANT UNCERTAIN WORLD
BORN FROM THAT DOLOROUS MEETING AND ECLIPSE
APPEARED IN THE EMPTINESS WHERE HER FEET HAD TROD
A QUICK OBSCURITY A SEEKING STIR
THERE WAS A WRITHING OF HALF-CONSCIOUS FORCE
HARDLY AWAKENED FROM THE INCONSCIENT'S SLEEP
TIED TO AN INSTINCT-DRIVEN IGNORANCE
TO FIND ITSELF AND FIND ITS HOLD ON THINGS
INHERITOR OF POVERTY AND LOSS
ASSAILED BY MEMORIES THAT FLED WHEN SEIZED
HAUNTED BY A FORGOTTEN UPLIFTING HOPE
IT STROVE WITH A BLINDNESS AS OF GROPING HANDS
TO FILL THE ACHING AND DISASTROUS GAP
BETWEEN EARTH-PAIN AND THE BLISS FROM WHICH LIFE FELL
A WORLD THAT EVER SEEKS FOR SOMETHING MISSED
HUNTS FOR THE JOY THAT EARTH HAS FAILED TO KEEP
TOO NEAR TO OUR GATES ITS UNAPPEASED UNREST
FOR PEACE TO LIVE ON THE INERT SOLID GLOBE
IT HAS JOINED ITS HUNGER TO THE HUNGER OF EARTH
IT HAS GIVEN THE LAW OF CRAVING TO OUR LIVES
IT HAS MADE OUR SPIRIT'S NEED A FATHOMLESS GULF
AN INFLUENCE ENTERED MORTAL NIGHT AND DAY
A SHADOW OVERCAST THE TIME-BORN RACE
IN THE TROUBLED STREAM WHERE LEAPS A BLIND HEART-PULSE
AND THE NERVE-BEAT OF FEELING WAKES IN SENSE
DIVIDING MATTER'S SLEEP FROM CONSCIOUS MIND
THERE STRAYED A CALL THAT KNEW NOT WHY IT CAME
A POWER BEYOND EARTH'S SCOPE HAS TOUCHED THE EARTH
THE REPOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAN BE NO MORE
A FORMLESS YEARNING PASSIONS IN MAN'S HEART
A CRY IS IN HIS BLOOD FOR HAPPIER THINGS
133
ELSE COULD HE ROAM ON A FREE SUNLIT SOIL
WITH THE CHILDLIKE PAIN-FORGETTING MIND OF BEASTS
OR LIVE HAPPY UNMOVED LIKE FLOWERS AND TREES
THE MIGHT THAT CAME UPON THE EARTH TO BLESS
HAS STAYED ON EARTH TO SUFFER AND ASPIRE
THE INFANT LAUGH THAT RANG THROUGH TIME IS HUSHED
MAN'S NATURAL JOY OF LIFE IS OVERCAST
AND SORROW IS HIS NURSE OF DESTINY
THE ANIMAL'S THOUGHTLESS JOY IS LEFT BEHIND
CARE AND REFLECTION BURDEN HIS DAILY WALK
HE HAS RISEN TO GREATNESS AND TO DISCONTENT
HE IS AWAKE TO THE INVISIBLE
INSATIATE SEEKER HE HAS ALL TO LEARN
HE HAS EXHAUSTED NOW LIFE'S SURFACE ACTS
HIS BEING'S HIDDEN REALMS REMAIN TO EXPLORE
HE BECOMES A MIND HE BECOMES A SPIRIT AND SELF
IN HIS FRAGILE TENEMENT HE GROWS NATURE'S LORD
IN HIM MATTER WAKES FROM ITS LONG OBSCURE TRANCE
IN HIM EARTH FEELS THE GODHEAD DRAWING NEAR
AN EYELESS POWER THAT SEES NO MORE ITS AIM
A RESTLESS HUNGRY ENERGY OF WILL
LIFE CAST HER SEED IN THE BODY'S INDOLENT MOULD
IT WOKE FROM HAPPY TORPOR A BLIND FORCE
COMPELLING IT TO SENSE AND SEEK AND FEEL
IN THE ENORMOUS LABOUR OF THE VOID
PERTURBING WITH HER DREAMS THE VAST ROUTINE
AND DEAD ROLL OF A SLUMBERING UNIVERSE
THE MIGHTY PRISONER STRUGGLED FOR RELEASE
ALIVE WITH HER YEARNING WOKE THE INERT CELL
IN THE HEART SHE KINDLED A FIRE OF PASSION AND NEED
AMID THE DEEP CALM OF INANIMATE THINGS
AROSE HER GREAT VOICE OF TOIL AND PRAYER AND STRIFE
A GROPING CONSCIOUSNESS IN A VOICELESS WORLD
A GUIDELESS SENSE WAS GIVEN HER FOR HER ROAD
THOUGHT WAS WITHHELD AND NOTHING NOW SHE KNEW
BUT ALL THE UNKNOWN WAS HERS TO FEEL AND CLASP
134
OBEYING THE PUSH OF UNBORN THINGS TOWARDS BIRTH
OUT OF HER SEAL OF INSENTIENT LIFE SHE BROKE
IN HER SUBSTANCE OF UNTHINKING MUTE SOUL-STRENGTH
THAT CANNOT UTTER WHAT ITS DEPTHS DIVINE
AWOKE A BLIND NECESSITY TO KNOW
THE CHAIN THAT BOUND HER SHE MADE HER INSTRUMENT
INSTINCT WAS HERS THE CHRYSALIS OF TRUTH
AND EFFORT AND GROWTH AND STRIVING NESCIENCE
INFLICTING ON THE BODY DESIRE AND HOPE
IMPOSING ON INCONSCIENCE CONSCIOUSNESS
SHE BROUGHT INTO MATTER'S DULL TENACITY
HER ANGUISHED CLAIM TO HER LOST SOVEREIGN RIGHT
HER TIRELESS SEARCH HER VEXED UNEASY HEART
HER WANDERING UNSURE STEPS HER CRY FOR CHANGE
ADORER OF A JOY WITHOUT A NAME
IN HER OBSCURE CATHEDRAL OF DELIGHT
TO DIM DWARF GODS SHE OFFERS SECRET RITES
BUT VAIN UNENDING IS THE SACRIFICE
THE PRIEST AN IGNORANT MAGE WHO ONLY MAKES
FUTILE MUTATIONS IN THE ALTAR'S PLAN
AND CASTS BLIND HOPES INTO A POWERLESS FLAME
A BURDEN OF TRANSIENT GAINS WEIGHS DOWN HER STEPS
AND HARDLY UNDER THAT LOAD CAN SHE ADVANCE
BUT THE HOURS CRY TO HER SHE TRAVELS ON
PASSING FROM THOUGHT TO THOUGHT FROM WANT TO WANT
HER GREATEST PROGRESS IS A DEEPENED NEED
MATTER DISSATISFIES SHE TURNS TO MIND
SHE CONQUERS EARTH HER FIELD THEN CLAIMS THE HEAVENS
INSENSIBLE BREAKING THE WORK SHE HAS DONE
THE STUMBLING AGES OVER HER LABOUR PASS
BUT STILL NO GREAT TRANSFORMING LIGHT CAME DOWN
AND NO REVEALING RAPTURE TOUCHED HER FALL
ONLY A GLIMMER SOMETIMES SPLITS MIND'S SKY
JUSTIFYING THE AMBIGUOUS PROVIDENCE
THAT MAKES OF NIGHT A PATH TO UNKNOWN DAWNS
OR A DARK CLUE TO SOME DIVINER STATE
135
IN NESCIENCE BEGAN HER MIGHTY TASK
IN IGNORANCE SHE PURSUES THE UNFINISHED WORK
FOR KNOWLEDGE GROPES BUT MEETS NOT WISDOM'S FACE
ASCENDING SLOWLY WITH UNCONSCIOUS STEPS
A FOUNDLING OF THE GODS SHE WANDERS HERE
LIKE A CHILD-SOUL LEFT NEAR THE GATES OF HELL
FUMBLING THROUGH FOG IN SEARCH OF PARADISE
IN THIS SLOW ASCENSION HE MUST FOLLOW HER PACE
EVEN FROM HER FAINT AND DIM SUBCONSCIOUS START
SO ONLY CAN EARTH'S LAST SALVATION COME
FOR SO ONLY COULD HE KNOW THE OBSCURE CAUSE
OF ALL THAT HOLDS US BACK AND BAFFLES GOD
IN THE JAIL-DELIVERY OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL
ALONG SWIFT PATHS OF FALL THROUGH DANGEROUS GATES
HE CHANCED INTO A GREY OBSCURITY
TEEMING WITH INSTINCTS FROM THE MINDLESS GULFS
THAT PUSHED TO WEAR A FORM AND WIN A PLACE
LIFE HERE WAS INTIMATE WITH DEATH AND NIGHT
AND ATE DEATH'S FOOD THAT SHE MIGHT BREATHE AWHILE
SHE WAS THEIR INMATE AND ADOPTED WAIF
ACCEPTING SUBCONSCIENCE IN DUMB DARKNESS' REIGN
A SOJOURNER SHE HOPED NOT ANY MORE
THERE FAR AWAY FROM TRUTH AND LUMINOUS THOUGHT
HE SAW THE ORIGINAL SEAT THE SEPARATE BIRTH
OF THE DETHRONED DEFORMED AND SUFFERING POWER
AN UNHAPPY FACE OF FALSITY MADE TRUE
A CONTRADICTION OF OUR DIVINE BIRTH
INDIFFERENT TO BEAUTY AND TO LIGHT
PARADING SHE FLAUNTED HER ANIMAL DISGRACE
UNHELPED BY CAMOUFLAGE BRUTAL AND BARE
AN AUTHENTIC IMAGE RECOGNISED AND SIGNED
OF HER OUTCAST FORCE EXILED FROM HEAVEN AND HOPE
FALLEN GLORYING IN THE VILENESS OF HER STATE
THE GROVEL OF A STRENGTH ONCE HALF DIVINE
THE GRACELESS SQUALOR OF HER BEAST DESIRES
136
THE STARING VISAGE OF HER IGNORANCE
THE NAKED BODY OF HER POVERTY
HERE FIRST SHE CRAWLED OUT FROM HER CABIN OF MUD
WHERE SHE HAD LAIN INCONSCIENT RIGID MUTE
ITS NARROWNESS AND TORPOR HELD HER STILL
A DARKNESS CLUNG TO HER UNEFFACED BY LIGHT
THERE NEARED NO TOUCH REDEEMING FROM ABOVE
THE UPWARD LOOK WAS ALIEN TO HER SIGHT
FORGOTTEN THE FEARLESS GODHEAD OF HER WALK
RENOUNCED WAS THE GLORY AND FELICITY
THE ADVENTURE IN THE DANGEROUS FIELDS OF TIME
HARDLY SHE AVAILED WALLOWING TO BEAR AND LIVE
A WIDE UNQUIET MIST OF SEEKING SPACE
A RAYLESS REGION SWALLOWED IN VAGUE SWATHES
THAT SEEMED UNNAMED UNBODIED AND UNHOUSED
A SWADDLED VISIONLESS AND FORMLESS MIND
ASKED FOR A BODY TO TRANSLATE ITS SOUL
ITS PRAYER DENIED IT FUMBLED AFTER THOUGHT
AS YET NOT POWERED TO THINK HARDLY TO LIVE
IT OPENED INTO A WEIRD AND PIGMY WORLD
WHERE THIS UNHAPPY MAGIC HAD ITS SOURCE
ON DIM CONFINES WHERE LIFE AND MATTER MEET
HE WANDERED AMONG THINGS HALF-SEEN HALF-GUESSED
PURSUED BY UNGRASPED BEGINNINGS AND LOST ENDS
THERE LIFE WAS BORN BUT DIED BEFORE IT COULD LIVE
THERE WAS NO SOLID GROUND NO CONSTANT DRIFT
ONLY SOME FLAME OF MINDLESS WILL HAD POWER
HIMSELF WAS DIM TO HIMSELF HALF-FELT OBSCURE
AS IF IN A STRUGGLE OF THE VOID TO BE
IN STRANGE DOMAINS WHERE ALL WAS LIVING SENSE
BUT MASTERING THOUGHT WAS NOT NOR CAUSE NOR RULE
ONLY A CRUDE CHILD-HEART CRIED FOR TOYS OF BLISS
MIND FLICKERED A DISORDERED INFANT GLOW
AND RANDOM SHAPELESS ENERGIES DROVE TOWARDS FORM
AND TOOK EACH WISP-FIRE FOR A GUIDING SUN
137
THIS BLINDFOLD FORCE COULD PLACE NO THINKING STEP
ASKING FOR LIGHT SHE FOLLOWED DARKNESS' CLUE
AN INCONSCIENT POWER GROPED TOWARDS CONSCIOUSNESS
MATTER SMITTEN BY MATTER GLIMMERED TO SENSE
BLIND CONTACTS SLOW REACTIONS BEAT OUT SPARKS
OF INSTINCT FROM A CLOAKED SUBLIMINAL BED
SENSATIONS CROWDED DUMB SUBSTITUTES FOR THOUGHT
PERCEPTION ANSWERED NATURE'S WAKENING BLOWS
BUT STILL WAS A MECHANICAL RESPONSE
A JERK A LEAP A START IN NATURE'S DREAM
AND RUDE UNCHASTENED IMPULSES JOSTLING RAN
HEEDLESS OF EVERY MOTION BUT THEIR OWN
AND DARKLING CLASHED WITH DARKER THAN THEMSELVES
FREE IN A WORLD OF SETTLED ANARCHY
THE NEED TO EXIST THE INSTINCT TO SURVIVE
ENGROSSED THE TENSE PRECARIOUS MOMENT'S WILL
AND AN UNSEEING DESIRE FELT OUT FOR FOOD
THE GUSTS OF NATURE WERE THE ONLY LAW
FORCE WRESTLED WITH FORCE BUT NO RESULT REMAINED
ONLY WERE ACHIEVED A NESCIENT GRASP AND DRIVE
AND FEELINGS AND INSTINCTS KNOWING NOT THEIR SOURCE
SENSE-PLEASURES AND SENSE-PANGS SOON CAUGHT SOON LOST
AND THE BRUTE MOTION OF UNTHINKING LIVES
IT WAS A VAIN UNNECESSARY WORLD
WHOSE WILL TO BE BROUGHT POOR AND SAD RESULTS
AND MEANINGLESS SUFFERING AND A GREY UNEASE
NOTHING SEEMED WORTH THE LABOUR TO BECOME
BUT JUDGED NOT SO HIS SPIRIT'S WAKENED EYE
AS SHINES A SOLITARY WITNESS STAR
THAT BURNS APART LIGHT'S LONELY SENTINEL
IN THE DRIFT AND TEEMING OF A MINDLESS NIGHT
A SINGLE THINKER IN AN AIMLESS WORLD
AWAITING SOME TREMENDOUS DAWN OF GOD
HE SAW THE PURPOSE IN THE WORKS OF TIME
EVEN IN THAT AIMLESSNESS A WORK WAS DONE
138
PREGNANT WITH MAGIC WILL AND CHANGE DIVINE
THE FIRST WRITHINGS OF THE COSMIC SERPENT FORCE
UNCOILED FROM THE MYSTIC RING OF MATTER'S TRANCE
IT RAISED ITS HEAD IN THE WARM AIR OF LIFE
IT COULD NOT CAST OFF YET NIGHT'S STIFFENING SLEEP
OR WEAR AS YET MIND'S WONDER-FLECKS AND STREAKS
PUT ON ITS JEWELLED HOOD THE CROWN OF SOUL
OR STAND ERECT IN THE BLAZE OF SPIRIT'S SUN
AS YET WERE ONLY SEEN FOULNESS AND FORCE
THE SECRET CRAWL OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO LIGHT
THROUGH A FERTILE SLIME OF LUST AND BATTENING SENSE
BENEATH THE BODY'S CRUST OF THICKENED SELF
A TARDY FERVENT WORKING IN THE DARK
THE TURBID YEAST OF NATURE'S PASSIONATE CHANGE
FERMENT OF THE SOUL'S CREATION OUT OF MIRE
A HEAVENLY PROCESS DONNED THIS GREY DISGUISE
A FALLEN IGNORANCE IN ITS COVERT NIGHT
LABOURED TO ACHIEVE ITS DUMB UNSEEMLY WORK
A CAMOUFLAGE OF THE INCONSCIENT'S NEED
TO RELEASE THE GLORY OF GOD IN NATURE'S MUD
HIS SIGHT SPIRITUAL IN EMBODYING ORBS
COULD PIERCE THROUGH THE GREY PHOSPHORESCENT HAZE
AND SCAN THE SECRETS OF THE SHIFTING FLUX
THAT ANIMATES THESE MUTE AND SOLID CELLS
AND LEADS THE THOUGHT AND LONGING OF THE FLESH
AND THE KEEN LUST AND HUNGER OF ITS WILL
THIS TOO HE TRACKED ALONG ITS HIDDEN STREAM
AND TRACED ITS ACTS TO A MIRACULOUS FOUNT
A MYSTIC PRESENCE NONE CAN PROBE NOR RULE
CREATOR OF THIS GAME OF RAY AND SHADE
IN THIS SWEET AND BITTER PARADOXICAL LIFE
ASKS FROM THE BODY THE SOUL'S INTIMACIES
AND BY THE SWIFT VIBRATION OF A NERVE
LINKS ITS MECHANIC THROBS TO LIGHT AND LOVE
IT SUMMONS THE SPIRIT'S SLEEPING MEMORIES
UP FROM SUBCONSCIENT DEPTHS BENEATH TIME'S FOAM
139
OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR FLAME OF HAPPY TRUTH
ARRIVING WITH HEAVY EYES THAT HARDLY SEE
THEY COME DISGUISED AS FEELINGS AND DESIRES
LIKE WEEDS UPON THE SURFACE FLOAT AWHILE
AND RISE AND SINK ON A SOMNAMBULIST TIDE
IMPURE DEGRADED THOUGH HER MOTIONS ARE
ALWAYS A HEAVEN-TRUTH BROODS IN LIFE'S DEEPS
IN HER OBSCUREST MEMBERS BURNS THAT FIRE
A TOUCH OF GOD'S RAPTURE IN CREATION'S ACTS
A LOST REMEMBRANCE OF FELICITY
LURKS STILL IN THE DUMB ROOTS OF DEATH AND BIRTH
THE WORLD'S SENSELESS BEAUTY MIRRORS GOD'S DELIGHT
THAT RAPTURE'S SMILE IS SECRET EVERYWHERE
IT FLOWS IN THE WIND'S BREATH IN THE TREE'S SAP
ITS HUED MAGNIFICENCE BLOOMS IN LEAVES AND FLOWERS
WHEN LIFE BROKE THROUGH ITS HALF-DROWSE IN THE PLANT
THAT FEELS AND SUFFERS BUT CANNOT MOVE OR CRY
IN BEAST AND IN WINGED BIRD AND THINKING MAN
IT MADE OF THE HEART'S RHYTHM ITS MUSIC'S BEAT
IT FORCED THE UNCONSCIOUS TISSUES TO AWAKE
AND ASK FOR HAPPINESS AND EARN THE PANG
AND THRILL WITH PLEASURE AND LAUGHTER OF BRIEF DELIGHT
AND QUIVER WITH PAIN AND CRAVE FOR ECSTASY
IMPERATIVE VOICELESS ILL-UNDERSTOOD
TOO FAR FROM LIGHT TOO CLOSE TO BEING'S CORE
BORN STRANGELY IN TIME FROM THE ETERNAL BLISS
IT PRESSES ON HEART'S CORE AND VIBRANT NERVE
ITS SHARP SELF-SEEKING TEARS OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
OUR PAIN AND PLEASURE HAVE THAT STING FOR CAUSE
INSTINCT WITH IT BUT BLIND TO ITS TRUE JOY
THE SOUL'S DESIRE LEAPS OUT TOWARDS PASSING THINGS
ALL NATURE'S LONGING DRIVE NONE CAN RESIST
COMES SURGING THROUGH THE BLOOD AND QUICKENED SENSE
AN ECSTASY OF THE INFINITE IS HER CAUSE
IT TURNS IN US TO FINITE LOVES AND LUSTS
THE WILL TO CONQUER AND HAVE TO SEIZE AND KEEP
140
TO ENLARGE LIFE'S ROOM AND SCOPE AND PLEASURE'S RANGE
TO BATTLE AND OVERCOME AND MAKE ONE'S OWN
THE HOPE TO MIX ONE'S JOY WITH OTHERS' JOY
A YEARNING TO POSSESS AND BE POSSESSED
TO ENJOY AND BE ENJOYED TO FEEL TO LIVE
HERE WAS ITS EARLY BRIEF ATTEMPT TO BE
ITS RAPID END OF MOMENTARY DELIGHT
WHOSE STAMP OF FAILURE HAUNTS ALL IGNORANT LIFE
INFLICTING STILL ITS HABIT ON THE CELLS
THE PHANTOM OF A DARK AND EVIL START
GHOSTLIKE PURSUES ALL THAT WE DREAM AND DO
ALTHOUGH ON EARTH ARE FIRM ESTABLISHED LIVES
A WORKING OF HABIT OR A SENSE OF LAW
A STEADY REPETITION IN THE FLUX
YET ARE ITS ROOTS OF WILL EVER THE SAME
THESE PASSIONS ARE THE STUFF OF WHICH WE ARE MADE
THIS WAS THE FIRST CRY OF THE AWAKING WORLD
IT CLINGS AROUND US STILL AND CLAMPS THE GOD
EVEN WHEN REASON IS BORN AND SOUL TAKES FORM
IN BEAST AND REPTILE AND IN THINKING MAN
IT LASTS AND IS THE FOUNT OF ALL THEIR LIFE
THIS TOO WAS NEEDED THAT BREATH AND LIVING MIGHT BE
THE SPIRIT IN A FINITE IGNORANT WORLD
MUST RESCUE SO ITS PRISONED CONSCIOUSNESS
FORCED OUT IN LITTLE JETS AT QUIVERING POINTS
FROM THE INCONSCIENT'S SEALED INFINITUDE
THEN SLOWLY IT GATHERS MASS LOOKS UP AT LIGHT
THIS NATURE LIVES TIED TO HER ORIGIN
A CLUTCH OF NETHER FORCE IS ON HER STILL
OUT OF UNCONSCIOUS DEPTHS HER INSTINCTS LEAP
A NEIGHBOUR IS HER LIFE TO INSENTIENT NOUGHT
UNDER THIS LAW AN IGNORANT WORLD WAS MADE
IN THE ENIGMA OF THE DARKENED VASTS
IN THE PASSION AND SELF-LOSS OF THE INFINITE
WHEN ALL WAS PLUNGED IN THE NEGATING VOID
NON-BEING'S NIGHT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SAVED
141
IF BEING HAD NOT PLUNGED INTO THE DARK
CARRYING WITH IT ITS TRIPLE MYSTIC CROSS
INVOKING IN WORLD-TIME THE TIMELESS TRUTH
BLISS CHANGED TO SORROW KNOWLEDGE MADE IGNORANT
GOD'S FORCE TURNED INTO A CHILD'S HELPLESSNESS
CAN BRING DOWN HEAVEN BY THEIR SACRIFICE
A CONTRADICTION FOUNDS THE BASE OF LIFE
THE ETERNAL THE DIVINE REALITY
HAS FACED ITSELF WITH ITS OWN CONTRARIES
BEING BECAME THE VOID AND CONSCIOUS-FORCE
NESCIENCE AND WALK OF A BLIND ENERGY
AND ECSTASY TOOK THE FIGURE OF WORLD-PAIN
IN A MYSTERIOUS DISPENSATION'S LAW
A WISDOM THAT PREPARES ITS FAR-OFF ENDS
PLANNED SO TO START HER SLOW AEONIC GAME
A BLINDFOLD SEARCH AND WRESTLE AND FUMBLING CLASP
OF A HALF-SEEN NATURE AND A HIDDEN SOUL
A GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK IN TWILIT ROOMS
A PLAY OF LOVE AND HATE AND FEAR AND HOPE
CONTINUES IN THE NURSERY OF MIND
ITS HARD AND HEAVY ROMP OF SELF-BORN TWINS
AT LAST THE STRUGGLING ENERGY CAN EMERGE
AND MEET THE VOICELESS BEING IN WIDER FIELDS
THEN CAN THEY SEE AND SPEAK AND BREAST TO BREAST
IN A LARGER CONSCIOUSNESS A CLEARER LIGHT
THE TWO EMBRACE AND STRIVE AND EACH KNOW EACH
REGARDING CLOSER NOW THE PLAYMATE'S FACE
EVEN IN THESE FORMLESS COILINGS HE COULD FEEL
MATTER'S RESPONSE TO AN INFANT STIR OF SOUL
IN NATURE HE SAW THE MIGHTY SPIRIT CONCEALED
WATCHED THE WEAK BIRTH OF A TREMENDOUS FORCE
PURSUED THE RIDDLE OF GODHEAD'S TENTATIVE PACE
HEARD THE FAINT RHYTHMS OF A GREAT UNBORN MUSE
THEN CAME A FIERIER BREATH OF WAKING LIFE
AND THERE AROSE FROM THE DIM GULF OF THINGS
142
THE STRANGE CREATIONS OF A THINKING SENSE
EXISTENCES HALF-REAL AND HALF-DREAM
A LIFE WAS THERE THAT HOPED NOT TO SURVIVE
BEINGS WERE BORN WHO PERISHED WITHOUT TRACE
EVENTS THAT WERE A FORMLESS DRAMA'S LIMBS
AND ACTIONS DRIVEN BY A BLIND CREATURE WILL
A SEEKING POWER FOUND OUT ITS ROAD TO FORM
PATTERNS WERE BUILT OF LOVE AND JOY AND PAIN
AND SYMBOL FIGURES FOR THE MOODS OF LIFE
AN INSECT HEDONISM FLUTTERED AND CRAWLED
AND BASKED IN A SUNLIT NATURE'S SURFACE THRILLS
AND DRAGON RAPTURES PYTHON AGONIES
CRAWLED IN THE MARSH AND MIRE AND LICKED THE SUN
HUGE ARMOURED STRENGTHS SHOOK A FRAIL QUAKING GROUND
GREAT PUISSANT CREATURES WITH A DWARFISH BRAIN
AND PIGMY TRIBES IMPOSED THEIR SMALL LIFE-DRIFT
IN A DWARF MODEL OF HUMANITY
NATURE NOW LAUNCHED THE EXTREME EXPERIENCE
AND MASTER-POINT OF HER DESIGN'S CAPRICE
LUMINOUS RESULT OF HER HALF-CONSCIOUS CLIMB
ON RUNGS TWIXT HER SUBLIMITIES AND GROTESQUES
TO MASSIVE FROM INFINITESIMAL SHAPES
TO A SUBTLE BALANCING OF BODY AND SOUL
TO AN ORDER OF INTELLIGENT LITTLENESS
AROUND HIM IN THE MOMENT-BEATS OF TIME
THE KINGDOM OF THE ANIMAL SELF AROSE
WHERE DEED IS ALL AND MIND IS STILL HALF-BORN
AND THE HEART OBEYS A DUMB UNSEEN CONTROL
THE FORCE THAT WORKS BY THE LIGHT OF IGNORANCE
HER ANIMAL EXPERIMENT BEGAN
CROWDING WITH CONSCIOUS CREATURES HER WORLD-SCHEME
BUT TO THE OUTWARD ONLY WERE THEY ALIVE
ONLY THEY REPLIED TO TOUCHES AND SURFACES
AND TO THE PRICK OF NEED THAT DROVE THEIR LIVES
A BODY THAT KNEW NOT ITS OWN SOUL WITHIN
THERE LIVED AND LONGED HAD WRATH AND JOY AND GRIEF
143
A MIND WAS THERE THAT MET THE OBJECTIVE WORLD
AS IF A STRANGER OR ENEMY AT ITS DOOR
ITS THOUGHTS WERE KNEADED BY THE SHOCKS OF SENSE
IT CAPTURED NOT THE SPIRIT IN THE FORM
IT ENTERED NOT THE HEART OF WHAT IT SAW
IT LOOKED NOT FOR THE POWER BEHIND THE ACT
IT STUDIED NOT THE HIDDEN MOTIVE IN THINGS
NOR STROVE TO FIND THE MEANING OF IT ALL
BEINGS WERE THERE WHO WORE A HUMAN FORM
ABSORBED THEY LIVED IN THE PASSION OF THE SCENE
BUT KNEW NOT WHO THEY WERE OR WHY THEY LIVED
CONTENT TO BREATHE TO FEEL TO SENSE TO ACT
LIFE HAD FOR THEM NO AIM SAVE NATURE'S JOY
AND THE STIMULUS AND DELIGHT OF OUTER THINGS
IDENTIFIED WITH THE SPIRIT'S OUTWARD SHELL
THEY WORKED FOR THE BODY'S WANTS THEY CRAVED NO MORE
THE VEILED SPECTATOR WATCHING FROM THEIR DEPTHS
FIXED NOT HIS INWARD EYE UPON HIMSELF
NOR TURNED TO FIND THE AUTHOR OF THE PLOT
HE SAW THE DRAMA ONLY AND THE STAGE
THERE WAS NO BROODING STRESS OF DEEPER SENSE
THE BURDEN OF REFLECTION WAS NOT BORNE
MIND LOOKED ON NATURE WITH UNKNOWING EYES
ADORED HER BOONS AND FEARED HER MONSTROUS STROKES
IT PONDERED NOT ON THE MAGIC OF HER LAWS
IT THIRSTED NOT FOR THE SECRET WELLS OF TRUTH
BUT MADE A REGISTER OF CROWDING FACTS
AND STRUNG SENSATIONS ON A VIVID THREAD
IT HUNTED AND IT FLED AND SNIFFED THE WINDS
OR SLOTHED INERT IN SUNSHINE AND SOFT AIR
IT SOUGHT THE ENGROSSING CONTACTS OF THE WORLD
BUT ONLY TO FEED THE SURFACE SENSE WITH BLISS
THESE FELT LIFE'S QUIVER IN THE OUTWARD TOUCH
THEY COULD NOT FEEL BEHIND THE TOUCH THE SOUL
TO GUARD THEIR FORM OF SELF FROM NATURE'S HARM
TO ENJOY AND TO SURVIVE WAS ALL THEIR CARE
144
THE NARROW HORIZON OF THEIR DAYS WAS FILLED
WITH THINGS AND CREATURES THAT COULD HELP AND HURT
THE WORLD'S VALUES HUNG UPON THEIR LITTLE SELF
ISOLATED CRAMPED IN THE VAST UNKNOWN
TO SAVE THEIR SMALL LIVES FROM SURROUNDING DEATH
THEY MADE A TINY CIRCLE OF DEFENCE
AGAINST THE SIEGE OF THE HUGE UNIVERSE
THEY PREYED UPON THE WORLD AND WERE ITS PREY
BUT NEVER DREAMED TO CONQUER AND BE FREE
OBEYING THE WORLD-POWER'S HINTS AND FIRM TABOOS
A SCANTY PART THEY DREW FROM HER RICH STORE
THERE WAS NO CONSCIOUS CODE AND NO LIFE-PLAN
THE PATTERNS OF THINKING OF A LITTLE GROUP
FIXED A TRADITIONAL BEHAVIOUR'S LAW
IGNORANT OF SOUL SAVE AS A WRAITH WITHIN
TIED TO A MECHANISM OF UNCHANGING LIVES
AND TO A DULL USUAL SENSE AND FEELING'S BEAT
THEY TURNED IN GROOVES OF ANIMAL DESIRE
IN WALLS OF STONE FENCED ROUND THEY WORKED AND WARRED
DID BY A BANDED SELFISHNESS A SMALL GOOD
OR WROUGHT A DREADFUL WRONG AND CRUEL PAIN
ON SENTIENT LIVES AND THOUGHT THEY DID NO ILL
ARDENT FROM THE SACK OF HAPPY PEACEFUL HOMES
AND GORGED WITH SLAUGHTER PLUNDER RAPE AND FIRE
THEY MADE OF HUMAN SELVES THEIR HELPLESS PREY
A DROVE OF CAPTIVES LED TO LIFELONG WOE
OR TORTURE A SPECTACLE MADE AND HOLIDAY
MOCKING OR THRILLED BY THEIR TORN VICTIMS' PANGS
ADMIRING THEMSELVES AS TITANS AND AS GODS
PROUDLY THEY SANG THEIR HIGH AND GLORIOUS DEEDS
AND PRAISED THEIR VICTORY AND THEIR SPLENDID FORCE
AN ANIMAL IN THE INSTINCTIVE HERD
PUSHED BY LIFE IMPULSES FORCED BY COMMON NEEDS
EACH IN HIS OWN KIND SAW HIS EGO'S GLASS
ALL SERVED THE AIM AND ACTION OF THE PACK
THOSE LIKE HIMSELF BY BLOOD OR CUSTOM KIN
145
TO HIM WERE PARTS OF HIS LIFE HIS ADJUNCT SELVES
HIS PERSONAL NEBULA'S CONSTITUENT STARS
SATELLITE COMPANIONS OF HIS SOLAR I
A M ASTER OF HIS LIFE'S ENVIRONMENT
A LEADER OF A HUDDLED HUMAN MASS
HERDING FOR SAFETY ON A DANGEROUS EARTH
HE GATHERED THEM ROUND HIM AS IF MINOR POWERS
TO MAKE A COMMON FRONT AGAINST THE WORLD
OR WEAK AND SOLE ON AN INDIFFERENT EARTH
AS A FORTRESS FOR HIS UNDEFENDED HEART
OR ELSE TO HEAL HIS BODY'S LONELINESS
IN OTHERS THAN HIS KIND HE SENSED A FOE
AN ALIEN UNLIKE FORCE TO SHUN AND FEAR
A STRANGER AND ADVERSARY TO HATE AND SLAY
OR HE LIVED AS LIVES THE SOLITARY BRUTE
AT WAR WITH ALL HE BORE HIS SINGLE FATE
ABSORBED IN THE PRESENT ACT THE FLEETING DAYS
NONE THOUGHT TO LOOK BEYOND THE HOUR'S GAINS
OR DREAMED TO MAKE THIS EARTH A FAIRER WORLD
OR FELT SOME TOUCH DIVINE SURPRISE HIS HEART
THE GLADNESS THAT THE FUGITIVE MOMENT GAVE
THE DESIRE GRASPED THE BLISS THE EXPERIENCE WON
MOVEMENT AND SPEED AND STRENGTH WERE JOY ENOUGH
AND BODILY LONGINGS SHARED AND QUARREL AND PLAY
AND TEARS AND LAUGHTER AND THE NEED CALLED LOVE
IN WAR AND CLASP THESE LIFE-WANTS JOINED THE ALL-LIFE
WRESTLINGS OF A DIVIDED UNITY
INFLICTING MUTUAL GRIEF AND HAPPINESS
IN IGNORANCE OF THE SELF FOR EVER ONE
ARMING ITS CREATURES WITH DELIGHT AND HOPE
A HALF-AWAKENED NESCIENCE STRUGGLED THERE
TO KNOW BY SIGHT AND TOUCH THE OUTSIDE OF THINGS
INSTINCT WAS FORMED IN MEMORY'S CROWDED SLEEP
THE PAST LIVED ON AS IN A BOTTOMLESS SEA
INVERTING INTO HALF-THOUGHT THE QUICKENED SENSE
SHE FELT AROUND FOR TRUTH WITH FUMBLING HANDS
146
CLUTCHED TO HER THE LITTLE SHE COULD REACH AND SEIZE
AND PUT ASIDE IN HER SUBCONSCIENT CAVE
SO MUST THE DIM BEING GROW IN LIGHT AND FORCE
AND RISE TO HIS HIGHER DESTINY AT LAST
LOOK UP TO GOD AND ROUND AT THE UNIVERSE
AND LEARN BY FAILURE AND PROGRESS BY FALL
AND BATTLE WITH ENVIRONMENT AND DOOM
BY SUFFERING DISCOVER HIS DEEP SOUL
AND BY POSSESSION GROW TO HIS OWN VASTS
HALF-WAY SHE STOPPED AND FOUND HER PATH NO MORE
STILL NOTHING WAS ACHIEVED BUT TO BEGIN
YET FINISHED SEEMED THE CIRCLE OF HER FORCE
ONLY SHE HAD BEATEN OUT SPARKS OF IGNORANCE
ONLY THE LIFE COULD THINK AND NOT THE MIND
ONLY THE SENSE COULD FEEL AND NOT THE SOUL
ONLY WAS LIT SOME HEAT OF THE FLAME OF LIFE
SOME JOY TO BE SOME RAPTUROUS LEAPS OF SENSE
ALL WAS AN IMPETUS OF HALF-CONSCIOUS FORCE
A SPIRIT SPRAWLING DROWNED IN DENSE LIFE-FOAM
A VAGUE SELF GRASPING AT THE SHAPE OF THINGS
BEHIND ALL MOVED SEEKING FOR VESSELS TO HOLD
A FIRST RAW VINTAGE OF THE GRAPES OF GOD
ON EARTH'S MUD A SPILTH OF THE SUPERNAL BLISS
INTOXICATING THE STUPEFIED SOUL AND MIND
A HEADY WINE OF RAPTURE DARK AND CRUDE
DIM UNCAST YET INTO SPIRITUAL FORM
OBSCURE INHABITANT OF THE WORLD'S BLIND CORE
AN UNBORN GODHEAD'S WILL A MUTE DESIRE
A THIRD CREATION NOW REVEALED ITS FACE
A MOULD OF BODY'S EARLY MIND WAS MADE
A GLINT OF LIGHT KINDLED THE OBSCURE WORLD-FORCE
IT DOWERED A DRIVEN WORLD WITH THE SEEING IDEA
AND ARMED THE ACT WITH THOUGHT'S DYNAMIC POINT
A SMALL THINKING BEING WATCHED THE WORKS OF TIME
A DIFFICULT EVOLUTION FROM BELOW
147
CALLED A MASKED INTERVENTION FROM ABOVE
ELSE THIS GREAT BLIND INCONSCIENT UNIVERSE
COULD NEVER HAVE DISCLOSED ITS HIDDEN MIND
OR EVEN IN BLINKERS WORKED IN BEAST AND MAN
THE INTELLIGENCE THAT DEVISED THE COSMIC SCHEME
AT FIRST HE SAW A DIM OBSCURE MIND-POWER
MOVING CONCEALED BY MATTER AND DUMB LIFE
A CURRENT THIN IT STREAMED IN LIFE'S VAST FLOW
TOSSING AND DRIFTING UNDER A DRIFTING SKY
AMID THE SURGE AND GLIMMERING TREMULOUS WASH
RELEASED IN SPLASH OF SENSE AND FEELING'S WAVES
IN THE DEEP MIDST OF AN INSENTIENT WORLD
ITS HUDDLED WAVES AND FOAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS RAN
PRESSING AND EDDYING THROUGH A NARROW STRAIT
CARRYING EXPERIENCE IN ITS CROWDED PACE
IT FLOWED EMERGING INTO UPPER LIGHT
FROM THE DEEP POOL OF ITS SUBLIMINAL BIRTH
TO REACH SOME HIGH EXISTENCE STILL UNKNOWN
THERE WAS NO THINKING SELF AIM THERE WAS NONE
ALL WAS UNORGANISED STRESS AND SEEKINGS VAGUE
ONLY TO THE UNSTABLE SURFACE ROSE
SENSATIONS STABS AND EDGES OF DESIRE
AND PASSION'S LEAPS AND BRIEF EMOTION'S CRIES
A CASUAL COLLOQUY OF FLESH WITH FLESH
A MURMUR OF HEART TO LONGING WORDLESS HEART
GLIMMERINGS OF KNOWLEDGE WITH NO SHAPE OF THOUGHT
AND JETS OF SUBCONSCIOUS WILL OR HUNGER'S PULLS
ALL WAS DIM SPARKLE ON A FOAMING TOP
IT WHIRLED AROUND A DRIFTING SHADOW-SELF
ON AN INCONSCIENT FLOOD OF FORCE IN TIME
THEN CAME THE PRESSURE OF A SEEING POWER
THAT DREW ALL INTO A DANCING TURBID MASS
CIRCLING AROUND A SINGLE LUMINOUS POINT
CENTRE OF REFERENCE IN A CONSCIOUS FIELD
FIGURE OF A UNITARY LIGHT WITHIN
IT LIT THE IMPULSE OF THE HALF-SENTIENT FLOOD
148
EVEN AN ILLUSION GAVE OF FIXITY
AS IF A SEA COULD SERVE AS A FIRM SOIL
THAT STRANGE OBSERVING POWER IMPOSED ITS SIGHT
IT FORCED ON FLUX A LIMIT AND A SHAPE
IT GAVE ITS STREAM A LOWER NARROW BANK
DREW LINES TO SNARE THE SPIRIT'S FORMLESSNESS
IT FASHIONED THE LIFE-MIND OF BIRD AND BEAST
THE ANSWER OF THE REPTILE AND THE FISH
THE PRIMITIVE PATTERN OF THE THOUGHTS OF MAN
A FINITE MOVEMENT OF THE INFINITE
CAME WINGING ITS WAY THROUGH A WIDE AIR OF TIME
A MARCH OF KNOWLEDGE MOVED IN NESCIENCE
AND GUARDED IN THE FORM A SEPARATE SOUL
ITS RIGHT TO BE IMMORTAL IT RESERVED
BUT BUILT A WALL AGAINST THE SIEGE OF DEATH
AND THREW A HOOK TO CLUTCH ETERNITY
A THINKING ENTITY APPEARED IN SPACE
A LITTLE ORDERED WORLD BROKE INTO VIEW
WHERE BEING HAD PRISON-ROOM FOR ACT AND SIGHT
A FLOOR TO WALK A CLEAR BUT SCANTY RANGE
AN INSTRUMENT-PERSONALITY WAS BORN
AND A RESTRICTED CLAMPED INTELLIGENCE
CONSENTED TO CONFINE IN NARROW BOUNDS
ITS SEEKING IT TIED THE THOUGHT TO VISIBLE THINGS
PROHIBITING THE ADVENTURE OF THE UNSEEN
AND THE SOUL'S TREAD THROUGH UNKNOWN INFINITIES
A REFLEX REASON NATURE-HABIT'S GLASS
ILLUMINED LIFE TO KNOW AND FIX ITS FIELD
ACCEPT A DANGEROUS IGNORANT BREVITY
AND THE INCONCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF ITS WALK
AND PROFIT BY THE HOUR'S PRECARIOUS CHANCE
IN THE ALLOTTED BOUNDARIES OF ITS FATE
A LITTLE JOY AND KNOWLEDGE SATISFIED
THIS LITTLE BEING TIED INTO A KNOT
AND HUNG ON A BULGE OF ITS ENVIRONMENT
A LITTLE CURVE CUT OFF IN MEASURELESS SPACE
149
A LITTLE SPAN OF LIFE IN ALL VAST TIME
A THOUGHT WAS THERE THAT PLANNED A WILL THAT STROVE
BUT FOR SMALL AIMS WITHIN A NARROW SCOPE
WASTING UNMEASURED TOIL ON TRANSIENT THINGS
IT KNEW ITSELF A CREATURE OF THE MUD
IT ASKED NO LARGER LAW NO LOFTIER AIM
IT HAD NO INWARD LOOK NO UPWARD GAZE
A BACKWARD SCHOLAR ON LOGIC'S RICKETY BENCH
INDOCTRINATED BY THE ERRING SENSE
IT TOOK APPEARANCE FOR THE FACE OF GOD
FOR CASUAL LIGHTS THE MARCHING OF THE SUNS
FOR HEAVEN A STARRY STRIP OF DOUBTFUL BLUE
ASPECTS OF BEING FEIGNED TO BE THE WHOLE
THERE WAS A VOICE OF BUSY INTERCHANGE
A MARKET-PLACE OF TRIVIAL THOUGHTS AND ACTS
A LIFE SOON SPENT A MIND THE BODY'S SLAVE
HERE SEEMED THE BRILLIANT CROWN OF NATURE'S WORK
AND TINY EGOS TOOK THE WORLD AS MEANS
TO SATE AWHILE DWARF LUSTS AND BRIEF DESIRES
IN A DEATH-CLOSED PASSAGE SAW LIFE'S START AND END
AS THOUGH A BLIND ALLEY WERE CREATION'S SIGN
AS IF FOR THIS THE SOUL HAD COVETED BIRTH
IN THE WONDERLAND OF A SELF-CREATING WORLD
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF COSMIC SPACE
THIS CREATURE PASSIONATE ONLY TO SURVIVE
FETTERED TO PUNY THOUGHTS WITH NO WIDE RANGE
AND TO THE BODY'S NEEDS AND PANGS AND JOYS
THIS FIRE GROWING BY ITS FUEL'S DEATH
INCREASED BY WHAT IT SEIZED AND MADE ITS OWN
IT GATHERED AND GREW AND GAVE ITSELF TO NONE
ONLY IT HOPED FOR GREATNESS IN ITS DEN
AND PLEASURE AND VICTORY IN SMALL FIELDS OF POWER
AND CONQUEST OF LIFE-ROOM FOR SELF AND KIN
AN ANIMAL LIMITED BY ITS FEEDING-SPACE
IT KNEW NOT THE IMMORTAL IN ITS HOUSE
IT HAD NO GREATER DEEPER CAUSE TO LIVE
150
IN LIMITS ONLY IT WAS POWERFUL
ACUTE TO CAPTURE TRUTH FOR OUTWARD USE
ITS KNOWLEDGE WAS THE BODY'S INSTRUMENT
ABSORBED IN THE LITTLE WORKS OF ITS PRISON-HOUSE
IT TURNED AROUND THE SAME UNCHANGING POINTS
IN THE SAME CIRCLE OF INTEREST AND DESIRE
BUT THOUGHT ITSELF THE MASTER OF ITS JAIL
ALTHOUGH FOR ACTION NOT FOR WISDOM MADE
THOUGHT WAS ITS APEX OR ITS GUTTER'S RIM
IT SAW AN IMAGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD
AND SAW ITS SURFACE SELF BUT KNEW NO MORE
OUT OF A SLOW CONFUSED EMBROILED SELF-SEARCH
MIND GREW TO A CLARITY CUT OUT PRECISE
A GLEAM ENCLOSED IN A STONE IGNORANCE
IN THIS BOUND THINKING'S NARROW LEADERSHIP
TIED TO THE SOIL INSPIRED BY COMMON THINGS
ATTACHED TO A CONFINED FAMILIAR WORLD
AMID THE MULTITUDE OF HER MOTIVED PLOTS
HER CHANGING ACTORS AND HER MILLION MASKS
LIFE WAS A PLAY MONOTONOUSLY THE SAME
THERE WERE NO VAST PERSPECTIVES OF THE SPIRIT
NO SWIFT INVASIONS OF UNKNOWN DELIGHT
NO GOLDEN DISTANCES OF WIDE RELEASE
THIS PETTY STATE RESEMBLED OUR HUMAN DAYS
BUT FIXED TO ETERNITY OF CHANGELESS TYPE
A MOMENT'S MOVEMENT DOOMED TO LAST THROUGH TIME
EXISTENCE BRIDGE-LIKE SPANNED THE INCONSCIENT GULFS
A HALF-ILLUMINED BUILDING IN A MIST
WHICH FROM A VOID OF FORM AROSE TO SIGHT
AND JUTTED OUT INTO A VOID OF SOUL
A LITTLE LIGHT IN A GREAT DARKNESS BORN
LIFE KNEW NOT WHERE IT WENT NOR WHENCE IT CAME
AROUND ALL FLOATED STILL THE NESCIENT HAZE
151
A FIXED AND NARROW POWER WITH RIGID FORMS
HE SAW THE EMPIRE OF THE LITTLE LIFE
AN UNHAPPY CORNER IN ETERNITY
IT LIVED UPON THE MARGIN OF THE IDEA
PROTECTED BY IGNORANCE AS IN A SHELL
THEN HOPING TO LEARN THE SECRET OF THIS WORLD
HE PEERED ACROSS ITS SCANTY FRINGE OF SIGHT
TO DISENGAGE FROM ITS SURFACE-CLEAR OBSCURITY
THE FORCE THAT MOVED IT AND THE IDEA THAT MADE
IMPOSING SMALLNESS ON THE INFINITE
THE RULING SPIRIT OF ITS LITTLENESS
THE DIVINE LAW THAT GAVE IT RIGHT TO BE
ITS CLAIM ON NATURE AND ITS NEED IN TIME
HE PLUNGED HIS GAZE INTO THE SIEGE OF MIST
THAT HELD THIS ILL-LIT STRAITENED CONTINENT
RINGED WITH THE SKIES AND SEAS OF IGNORANCE
AND KEPT IT SAFE FROM TRUTH AND SELF AND LIGHT
AS WHEN A SEARCHLIGHT STABS THE NIGHT'S BLIND BREAST
AND DWELLINGS AND TREES AND FIGURES OF MEN APPEAR
AS IF REVEALED TO AN EYE IN NOTHINGNESS
ALL LURKING THINGS WERE TORN OUT OF THEIR VEILS
AND HELD UP IN HIS VISION'S SUN-WHITE BLAZE
A BUSY RESTLESS UNCOUTH POPULACE
TEEMED IN THEIR DUSKY UNNOTED THOUSANDS THERE
IN A MIST OF SECRECY WRAPPING THE WORLD-SCENE
THE LITTLE DEITIES OF TIME'S NETHER ACT
WHO WORK REMOTE FROM HEAVEN'S CONTROLLING EYE
PLOTTED UNKNOWN TO THE CREATURES WHOM THEY MOVE
THE SMALL CONSPIRACIES OF THIS PETTY REIGN
AMUSED WITH THE SMALL CONTRIVINGS THE BRIEF HOPES
AND LITTLE EAGER STEPS AND LITTLE WAYS
152
AND REPTILE WALLOWINGS IN THE DARK AND DUST
AND THE CROUCH AND IGNOMINY OF CREEPING LIFE
A TREPIDANT AND MOTLEY MULTITUDE
A STRANGE PELL-MELL OF MAGIC ARTISANS
WAS SEEN MOULDING THE PLASTIC CLAY OF LIFE
AN ELFIN BROOD AN ELEMENTAL KIND
ASTONISHED BY THE UNACCUSTOMED GLOW
AS IF IMMANENT IN THE SHADOWS STARTED UP
IMPS WITH WRY LIMBS AND CARVED BEAST VISAGES
SPRITE-PROMPTERS GOBLIN-WIZENED OR FAERY-SMALL
AND GENII FAIRER BUT UNSOULED AND POOR
AND FALLEN BEINGS THEIR HEAVENLY PORTION LOST
AND ERRANT DIVINITIES TRAPPED IN TIME'S DUST
IGNORANT AND DANGEROUS WILLS BUT ARMED WITH POWER
HALF-ANIMAL HALF-GOD THEIR MOOD THEIR SHAPE
OUT OF THE GREYNESS OF A DIM BACKGROUND
THEIR WHISPERS COME AN INARTICULATE FORCE
AWAKE IN MIND AN ECHOING THOUGHT OR WORD
TO THEIR STING OF IMPULSE THE HEART'S SANCTION DRAW
AND IN THAT LITTLE NATURE DO THEIR WORK
AND FILL ITS POWERS AND CREATURES WITH UNEASE
ITS SEED OF JOY THEY CURSE WITH SORROW'S FRUIT
PUT OUT WITH ERROR'S BREATH ITS SCANTY LIGHTS
AND TURN ITS SURFACE TRUTHS TO FALSEHOOD'S ENDS
ITS SMALL EMOTIONS SPUR ITS PASSIONS DRIVE
TO THE ABYSS OR THROUGH THE BOG AND MIRE
OR ELSE WITH A GOAD OF HARD DRY LUSTS THEY PRICK
WHILE JOGS ON DEVIOUS WAYS THAT NOWHERE LEAD
LIFE'S CART FINDING NO ISSUE FROM IGNORANCE
TO SPORT WITH GOOD AND EVIL IS THEIR LAW
LURING TO FAILURE AND MEANINGLESS SUCCESS
ALL MODELS THEY CORRUPT ALL MEASURES CHEAT
MAKE KNOWLEDGE A POISON VIRTUE A PATTERN DULL
AND LEAD THE ENDLESS CYCLES OF DESIRE
THROUGH SEMBLANCES OF SAD OR HAPPY CHANCE
TO AN INESCAPABLE FATALITY
153
ALL BY THEIR INFLUENCE IS ENACTED THERE
NOR THERE ALONE IS THEIR EMPIRE OR THEIR ROLE
WHEREVER ARE SOULLESS MINDS AND GUIDELESS LIVES
AND IN A SMALL BODY SELF IS ALL THAT COUNTS
WHEREVER LOVE AND LIGHT AND LARGENESS LACK
THESE CROOKED FASHIONERS TAKE UP THEIR TASK
TO ALL HALF-CONSCIOUS WORLDS THEY EXTEND THEIR REIGN
HERE TOO THESE GODLINGS DRIVE OUR HUMAN HEARTS
OUR NATURE'S TWILIGHT IS THEIR LURKING-PLACE
HERE TOO THE DARKENED PRIMITIVE HEART OBEYS
THE VEILED SUGGESTIONS OF A HIDDEN MIND
THAT DOGS OUR KNOWLEDGE WITH MISLEADING LIGHT
AND STANDS BETWEEN US AND THE TRUTH THAT SAVES
IT SPEAKS TO US WITH THE VOICES OF THE NIGHT
OUR DARKENED LIVES TO GREATER DARKNESS MOVE
OUR SEEKINGS LISTEN TO CALAMITOUS HOPES
A STRUCTURE OF UNSEEING THOUGHTS IS BUILT
AND REASON USED BY AN IRRATIONAL FORCE
THIS EARTH IS NOT ALONE OUR TEACHER AND NURSE
THE POWERS OF ALL THE WORLDS HAVE ENTRANCE HERE
IN THEIR OWN FIELDS THEY FOLLOW THE WHEEL OF LAW
AND CHERISH THE SAFETY OF A SETTLED TYPE
ON EARTH OUT OF THEIR CHANGELESS ORBIT THROWN
THEIR LAW IS KEPT LOST THEIR FIXED FORM OF THINGS
INTO A CREATIVE CHAOS THEY ARE CAST
WHERE ALL ASKS ORDER BUT IS DRIVEN BY CHANCE
STRANGERS TO EARTH-NATURE THEY MUST LEARN EARTH'S WAYS
ALIENS OR OPPOSITES THEY MUST UNITE
THEY WORK AND BATTLE AND WITH PAIN AGREE
THESE JOIN THOSE PART ALL PARTS AND JOINS ANEW
BUT NEVER CAN WE KNOW AND TRULY LIVE
TILL ALL HAVE FOUND THEIR DIVINE HARMONY
OUR LIFE'S UNCERTAIN WAY WINDS CIRCLING ON
OUR MIND'S UNQUIET SEARCH ASKS ALWAYS LIGHT
TILL THEY HAVE LEARNED THEIR SECRET IN THEIR SOURCE
IN THE LIGHT OF THE TIMELESS AND ITS SPACELESS HOME
154
IN THE JOY OF THE ETERNAL SOLE AND ONE
BUT NOW THE LIGHT SUPREME IS FAR AWAY
OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE OBEYS THE INCONSCIENT'S LAWS
TO IGNORANT PURPOSES AND BLIND DESIRES
OUR HEARTS ARE MOVED BY AN AMBIGUOUS FORCE
EVEN OUR MIND'S CONQUESTS WEAR A BATTERED CROWN
A SLOWLY CHANGING ORDER BINDS OUR WILL
THIS IS OUR DOOM UNTIL OUR SOULS ARE FREE
A MIGHTY HAND THEN ROLLS MIND'S FIRMAMENTS BACK
INFINITY TAKES UP THE FINITE'S ACTS
AND NATURE STEPS INTO THE ETERNAL LIGHT
THEN ONLY ENDS THIS DREAM OF NETHER LIFE
AT THE OUTSET OF THIS ENIGMATIC WORLD
WHICH SEEMS AT ONCE AN ENORMOUS BRUTE MACHINE
AND A SLOW UNMASKING OF THE SPIRIT IN THINGS
IN THIS REVOLVING CHAMBER WITHOUT WALLS
IN WHICH GOD SITS IMPASSIVE EVERYWHERE
AS IF UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF AND BY US UNSEEN
IN A MIRACLE OF INCONSCIENT SECRECY
YET IS ALL HERE HIS ACTION AND HIS WILL
IN THIS WHIRL AND SPRAWL THROUGH INFINITE VACANCY
THE SPIRIT BECAME MATTER AND LAY IN THE WHIRL
A BODY SLEEPING WITHOUT SENSE OR SOUL
A MASS PHENOMENON OF VISIBLE SHAPES
SUPPORTED BY THE SILENCE OF THE VOID
APPEARED IN THE ETERNAL CONSCIOUSNESS
AND SEEMED AN OUTWARD AND INSENSIBLE WORLD
THERE WAS NONE THERE TO SEE AND NONE TO FEEL
ONLY THE MIRACULOUS INCONSCIENT
A SUBTLE WIZARD SKILLED WAS AT ITS TASK
INVENTING WAYS FOR MAGICAL RESULTS
MANAGING CREATION'S MARVELLOUS DEVICE
MARKING MECHANICALLY DUMB WISDOM'S POINTS
USING THE UNTHOUGHT INEVITABLE IDEA
IT DID THE WORKS OF GOD'S INTELLIGENCE
155
OR WROUGHT THE WILL OF SOME SUPREME UNKNOWN
STILL CONSCIOUSNESS WAS HIDDEN IN NATURE'S WOMB
UNFELT WAS THE BLISS WHOSE RAPTURE DREAMED THE WORLDS
BEING WAS AN INERT SUBSTANCE DRIVEN BY FORCE
AT FIRST WAS ONLY AN ETHERIC SPACE
ITS HUGE VIBRATIONS CIRCLED ROUND AND ROUND
HOUSING SOME UNCONCEIVED INITIATIVE
UPHELD BY A SUPREME ORIGINAL BREATH
EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION'S MYSTIC ACT
CREATED TOUCH AND FRICTION IN THE VOID
INTO ABSTRACT EMPTINESS BROUGHT CLASH AND CLASP
PARENT OF AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE
IN A MATRIX OF DISINTEGRATING FORCE
BY SPENDING IT CONSERVED AN ENDLESS SUM
ON THE HEARTH OF SPACE IT KINDLED A VIEWLESS FIRE
THAT SCATTERING WORLDS AS ONE MIGHT SCATTER SEEDS
WHIRLED OUT THE LUMINOUS ORDER OF THE STARS
AN OCEAN OF ELECTRIC ENERGY
FORMLESSLY FORMED ITS STRANGE WAVE-PARTICLES
CONSTRUCTING BY THEIR DANCE THIS SOLID SCHEME
ITS MIGHTINESS IN THE ATOM SHUT TO REST
MASSES WERE FORGED OR FEIGNED AND VISIBLE SHAPES
LIGHT FLUNG THE PHOTON'S SWIFT REVEALING SPARK
AND SHOWED IN THE MINUTENESS OF ITS FLASH
IMAGED THIS COSMOS OF APPARENT THINGS
THUS HAS BEEN MADE THIS REAL IMPOSSIBLE WORLD
AN OBVIOUS MIRACLE OR CONVINCING SHOW
OR SO IT SEEMS TO MAN'S AUDACIOUS MIND
WHO SEATS HIS THOUGHT AS THE ARBITER OF TRUTH
HIS PERSONAL VISION AS IMPERSONAL FACT
AS WITNESSES OF AN OBJECTIVE WORLD
HIS ERRING SENSE AND HIS INSTRUMENTS' ARTIFICE
THUS MUST HE WORK LIFE'S TANGIBLE RIDDLE OUT
IN A DOUBTFUL LIGHT BY ERROR SEIZE ON TRUTH
AND SLOWLY PART THE VISAGE AND THE VEIL
OR ELSE FORLORN OF FAITH IN MIND AND SENSE
156
HIS KNOWLEDGE A BRIGHT BODY OF IGNORANCE
HE SEES IN ALL THINGS STRANGELY FASHIONED HERE
THE UNWELCOME JEST OF A DECEIVING FORCE
A PARABLE OF MAYA AND HER MIGHT
THIS VAST PERPETUAL MOTION CAUGHT AND HELD
IN THE MYSTERIOUS AND UNCHANGING CHANGE
OF THE PERSISTENT MOVEMENT WE CALL TIME
AND EVER RENEWING ITS RECURRENT BEAT
THESE MOBILE ROUNDS THAT STEREOTYPE A FLUX
THESE STATIC OBJECTS IN THE COSMIC DANCE
THAT ARE BUT ENERGY'S SELF-REPEATING WHORLS
PROLONGED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE BROODING VOID
AWAITED LIFE AND SENSE AND WAKING MIND
A LITTLE THE DREAMER CHANGED HIS POSE OF STONE
BUT WHEN THE INCONSCIENT'S SCRUPULOUS WORK WAS DONE
AND CHANCE COERCED BY FIXED IMMUTABLE LAWS
A SCENE WAS SET FOR NATURE'S CONSCIOUS PLAY
THEN STIRRED THE SPIRIT'S MUTE IMMOBILE SLEEP
THE FORCE CONCEALED BROKE DUMBLY SLOWLY OUT
A DREAM OF LIVING WOKE IN MATTER'S HEART
A WILL TO LIVE MOVED THE INCONSCIENT'S DUST
A FREAK OF LIVING STARTLED VACANT TIME
EPHEMERAL IN A BLANK ETERNITY
INFINITESIMAL IN A DEAD INFINITE
A SUBTLER BREATH QUICKENED DEAD MATTER'S FORMS
THE WORLD'S SET RHYTHM CHANGED TO A CONSCIOUS CRY
A SERPENT POWER TWINNED THE INSENSIBLE FORCE
ISLANDS OF LIVING DOTTED LIFELESS SPACE
AND GERMS OF LIVING FORMED IN FORMLESS AIR
A LIFE WAS BORN THAT FOLLOWED MATTER'S LAW
IGNORANT OF THE MOTIVES OF ITS STEPS
EVER INCONSTANT YET FOR EVER THE SAME
IT REPEATED THE PARADOX THAT GAVE IT BIRTH
ITS RESTLESS AND UNSTABLE STABILITIES
RECURRED INCESSANTLY IN THE FLOW OF TIME
AND PURPOSEFUL MOVEMENTS IN UNTHINKING FORMS
157
BETRAYED THE HEAVINGS OF AN IMPRISONED WILL
WAKING AND SLEEP LAY LOCKED IN MUTUAL ARMS
HELPLESS AND INDISTINCT CAME PLEASURE AND PAIN
TREMBLING WITH THE FIRST FAINT THRILLS OF A WORLD-SOUL
A STRENGTH OF LIFE THAT COULD NOT CRY OR MOVE
YET BROKE INTO BEAUTY SIGNING SOME DEEP DELIGHT
AN INARTICULATE SENSIBILITY
THROBS OF THE HEART OF AN UNKNOWING WORLD
RAN THROUGH ITS SOMNOLENT TORPOR AND THERE STIRRED
A VAGUE UNCERTAIN THRILL A WANDERING BEAT
A DIM UNCLOSING AS OF SECRET EYES
INFANT SELF-FEELING GREW AND BIRTH WAS BORN
A GODHEAD WOKE BUT LAY WITH DREAMING LIMBS
HER HOUSE REFUSED TO OPEN ITS SEALED DOORS
INSENTIENT TO OUR EYES THAT ONLY SEE
THE FORM THE ACT AND NOT THE IMPRISONED GOD
LIFE HID IN HER PULSE OCCULT OF GROWTH AND POWER
A CONSCIOUSNESS WITH MUTE STIFLED BEATS OF SENSE
A MIND SUPPRESSED THAT KNEW NOT YET OF THOUGHT
AN INERT SPIRIT THAT COULD ONLY BE
AT FIRST SHE RAISED NO VOICE NO MOTION DARED
CHARGED WITH WORLD-POWER INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE
ONLY SHE CLUNG WITH HER ROOTS TO THE SAFE EARTH
THRILLED DUMBLY TO THE SHOCKS OF RAY AND BREEZE
AND PUT OUT TENDRIL FINGERS OF DESIRE
THE STRENGTH IN HER YEARNING FOR SUN AND LIGHT
FELT NOT THE EMBRACE THAT MADE HER BREATHE AND LIVE
ABSORBED SHE DREAMED CONTENT WITH BEAUTY AND HUE
AT LAST THE CHARMED IMMENSITY LOOKED FORTH
ASTIR VIBRANT HUNGERING SHE GROPED FOR MIND
THEN SLOWLY SENSE QUIVERED AND THOUGHT PEERED OUT
SHE FORCED THE RELUCTANT MOULD TO GROW AWARE
THE MAGIC WAS CHISELLED OF A CONSCIOUS FORM
ITS TRANCED VIBRATIONS RHYTHMED A QUICK RESPONSE
AND LUMINOUS STIRRINGS PROMPTED BRAIN AND NERVE
AWOKE IN MATTER SPIRIT'S IDENTITY
158
AND IN A BODY LIT THE MIRACLE
OF THE HEART'S LOVE AND THE SOUL'S WITNESS GAZE
IMPELLED BY AN UNSEEN WILL THERE COULD BREAK OUT
FRAGMENTS OF SOME VAST IMPULSE TO BECOME
AND VIVID GLIMPSES OF A SECRET SELF
AND THE DOUBTFUL SEEDS AND FORCE OF SHAPES TO BE
AWOKE FROM THE INCONSCIENT SWOON OF THINGS
AN ANIMAL CREATION CREPT AND RAN
AND FLEW AND CALLED BETWEEN THE EARTH AND SKY
HUNTED BY DEATH BUT HOPING STILL TO LIVE
AND GLAD TO BREATHE IF ONLY FOR A WHILE
THEN MAN WAS MOULDED FROM THE ORIGINAL BRUTE
A THINKING MIND HAD COME TO LIFT LIFE'S MOODS
THE KEEN-EDGED TOOL OF A NATURE MIXED AND VAGUE
AN INTELLIGENCE HALF-WITNESS HALF-MACHINE
THIS SEEMING DRIVER OF HER WHEEL OF WORKS
MISSIONED TO MOTIVE AND RECORD HER DRIFT
AND FIX ITS LAW ON HER INCONSTANT POWERS
THIS MASTER-SPRING OF A DELICATE ENGINERY
ASPIRED TO ENLIGHTEN ITS USER AND REFINE
LIFTING TO A VISION OF THE INDWELLING POWER
THE ABSORBED MECHANIC'S CRUDE INITIATIVE
HE RAISED HIS EYES HEAVEN-LIGHT MIRRORED A FACE
AMAZED AT THE WORKS WROUGHT IN HER MYSTIC SLEEP
SHE LOOKED UPON THE WORLD THAT SHE HAD MADE
WONDERING NOW SEIZED THE GREAT AUTOMATON
SHE PAUSED TO UNDERSTAND HER SELF AND AIM
PONDERING SHE LEARNED TO ACT BY CONSCIOUS RULE
A VISIONED MEASURE GUIDED HER RHYTHMIC STEPS
THOUGHT BORDERED HER INSTINCTS WITH A FRAME OF WILL
AND LIT WITH THE IDEA HER BLINDED URGE
ON HER MASS OF IMPULSES HER REFLEX ACTS
ON THE INCONSCIENT'S PUSHED OR GUIDED DRIFT
AND MYSTERY OF UNTHINKING ACCURATE STEPS
SHE STUCK THE SPECIOUS IMAGE OF A SELF
A LIVING IDOL OF DISFIGURED SPIRIT
159
ON MATTER'S ACTS SHE IMPOSED A PATTERNED LAW
SHE MADE A THINKING BODY FROM CHEMIC CELLS
AND MOULDED A BEING OUT OF A DRIVEN FORCE
TO BE WHAT SHE WAS NOT INFLAMED HER HOPE
SHE TURNED HER DREAM TOWARDS SOME HIGH UNKNOWN
A BREATH WAS FELT BELOW OF ONE SUPREME
AN OPENING LOOKED UP TO SPHERES ABOVE
AND COLOURED SHADOWS LIMNED ON MORTAL GROUND
THE PASSING FIGURES OF IMMORTAL THINGS
A QUICK CELESTIAL FLASH COULD SOMETIMES COME
THE ILLUMINED SOUL-RAY FELL ON HEART AND FLESH
AND TOUCHED WITH SEMBLANCES OF IDEAL LIGHT
THE STUFF OF WHICH OUR EARTHLY DREAMS ARE MADE
A FRAGILE HUMAN LOVE THAT COULD NOT LAST
EGO'S MOTH-WINGS TO LIFT THE SERAPH SOUL
APPEARED A SURFACE GLAMOUR OF BRIEF DATE
EXTINGUISHED BY A SCANTY BREATH OF TIME
JOY THAT FORGOT MORTALITY FOR A WHILE
CAME A RARE VISITOR WHO LEFT BETIMES
AND MADE ALL THINGS SEEM BEAUTIFUL FOR AN HOUR
HOPES THAT SOON FADE TO DRAB REALITIES
AND PASSIONS THAT CRUMBLE TO ASHES WHILE THEY BLAZE
KINDLED THE COMMON EARTH WITH THEIR BRIEF FLAME
A CREATURE INSIGNIFICANT AND SMALL
VISITED UPLIFTED BY AN UNKNOWN POWER
MAN LABOURED ON HIS LITTLE PATCH OF EARTH
FOR MEANS TO LAST TO ENJOY TO SUFFER AND DIE
A SPIRIT THAT PERISHED NOT WITH THE BODY AND BREATH
WAS THERE LIKE A SHADOW OF THE UNMANIFEST
AND STOOD BEHIND THE LITTLE PERSONAL FORM
BUT CLAIMED NOT YET THIS EARTHLY EMBODIMENT
ASSENTING TO NATURE'S LONG SLOW-MOVING TOIL
WATCHING THE WORKS OF HIS OWN IGNORANCE
UNKNOWN UNFELT THE MIGHTY WITNESS LIVES
AND NOTHING SHOWS THE GLORY THAT IS HERE
A WISDOM GOVERNING THE MYSTIC WORLD
160
A SILENCE LISTENING TO THE CRY OF LIFE
IT SEES THE HURRYING CROWD OF MOMENTS STREAM
TOWARDS THE STILL GREATNESS OF A DISTANT HOUR
THIS HUGE WORLD UNINTELLIGIBLY TURNS
IN THE SHADOW OF A MUSED INCONSCIENCE
IT HIDES A KEY TO INNER MEANINGS MISSED
IT LOCKS IN OUR HEARTS A VOICE WE CANNOT HEAR
AN ENIGMATIC LABOUR OF THE SPIRIT
AN EXACT MACHINE OF WHICH NONE KNOWS THE USE
AN ART AND INGENUITY WITHOUT SENSE
THIS MINUTE ELABORATE ORCHESTRATED LIFE
FOR EVER PLAYS ITS MOTIVELESS SYMPHONIES
THE MIND LEARNS AND KNOWS NOT TURNING ITS BACK TO TRUTH
IT STUDIES SURFACE LAWS BY SURFACE THOUGHT
LIFE'S STEPS SURVEYS AND NATURE'S PROCESS SEES
NOT SEEING FOR WHAT SHE ACTS OR WHY WE LIVE
IT MARKS HER TIRELESS CARE OF JUST DEVICE
HER PATIENT INTRICACY OF FINE DETAIL
THE INGENIOUS SPIRIT'S BRAVE INVENTIVE PLAN
IN HER GREAT FUTILE MASS OF ENDLESS WORKS
ADDS PURPOSEFUL FIGURES TO HER PURPOSELESS SUM
ITS GABLED STOREYS PILES ITS CLIMBING ROOFS
ON THE CLOSE-CARVED FOUNDATIONS SHE HAS LAID
IMAGINED CITADELS REARED IN MYTHIC AIR
OR MOUNTS A STAIR OF DREAM TO A MYSTIC MOON
TRANSIENT CREATIONS POINT AND HIT THE SKY
A WORLD-CONJECTURE'S SCHEME IS LABOURED OUT
ON THE DIM FLOOR OF MIND'S INCERTITUDE
OR PAINFULLY BUILT A FRAGMENTARY WHOLE
IMPENETRABLE A MYSTERY RECONDITE
IS THE VAST PLAN OF WHICH WE ARE A PART
ITS HARMONIES ARE DISCORDS TO OUR VIEW
BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT THE GREAT THEME THEY SERVE
INSCRUTABLE WORK THE COSMIC AGENCIES
ONLY THE FRINGE OF A WIDE SURGE WE SEE
161
OUR INSTRUMENTS HAVE NOT THAT GREATER LIGHT
OUR WILL TUNES NOT WITH THE ETERNAL WILL
OUR HEART'S SIGHT IS TOO BLIND AND PASSIONATE
IMPOTENT TO SHARE IN NATURE'S MYSTIC TACT
INAPT TO FEEL THE PULSE AND CORE OF THINGS
OUR REASON CANNOT SOUND LIFE'S MIGHTY SEA
AND ONLY COUNTS ITS WAVES AND SCANS ITS FOAM
IT KNOWS NOT WHENCE THESE MOTIONS TOUCH AND PASS
IT SEES NOT WHITHER SWEEPS THE HURRYING FLOOD
ONLY IT STRIVES TO CANALISE ITS POWERS
AND HOPES TO TURN ITS COURSE TO HUMAN ENDS
BUT ALL ITS MEANS COME FROM THE INCONSCIENT'S STORE
UNSEEN HERE ACT DIM HUGE WORLD-ENERGIES
AND ONLY TRICKLES AND CURRENTS ARE OUR SHARE
OUR MIND LIVES FAR OFF FROM THE AUTHENTIC LIGHT
CATCHING AT LITTLE FRAGMENTS OF THE TRUTH
IN A SMALL CORNER OF INFINITY
OUR LIVES ARE INLETS OF AN OCEAN'S FORCE
OUR CONSCIOUS MOVEMENTS HAVE SEALED ORIGINS
BUT WITH THOSE SHADOWY SEATS NO CONVERSE HOLD
NO UNDERSTANDING BINDS OUR COMRADE PARTS
OUR ACTS EMERGE FROM A CRYPT OUR MINDS IGNORE
OUR DEEPEST DEPTHS ARE IGNORANT OF THEMSELVES
EVEN OUR BODY IS A MYSTERY SHOP
AS OUR EARTH'S ROOTS LURK SCREENED BELOW OUR EARTH
SO LIE UNSEEN OUR ROOTS OF MIND AND LIFE
OUR SPRINGS ARE KEPT CLOSE HID BENEATH WITHIN
OUR SOULS ARE MOVED BY POWERS BEHIND THE WALL
IN THE SUBTERRANEAN REACHES OF THE SPIRIT
A PUISSANCE ACTS AND RECKS NOT WHAT IT MEANS
USING UNTHINKING MONITORS AND SCRIBES
IT IS THE CAUSE OF WHAT WE THINK AND FEEL
THE TROGLODYTES OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
ILL-TRAINED SLOW STAMMERING INTERPRETERS
ONLY OF THEIR SMALL TASK'S ROUTINE AWARE
AND BUSY WITH THE RECORD IN OUR CELLS
162
CONCEALED IN THE SUBLIMINAL SECRECIES
MID AN OBSCURE OCCULT MACHINERY
CAPTURE THE MYSTIC MORSE WHOSE MEASURED LILT
TRANSMITS THE MESSAGES OF THE COSMIC FORCE
A WHISPER FALLS INTO LIFE'S INNER EAR
AND ECHOES FROM THE DUN SUBCONSCIENT CAVES
SPEECH LEAPS THOUGHT QUIVERS THE HEART VIBRATES THE WILL
ANSWERS AND TISSUE AND NERVE OBEY THE CALL
OUR LIVES TRANSLATE THESE SUBTLE INTIMACIES
ALL IS THE COMMERCE OF A SECRET POWER
A THINKING PUPPET IS THE MIND OF LIFE
ITS CHOICE IS THE WORK OF ELEMENTAL STRENGTHS
THAT KNOW NOT THEIR OWN BIRTH AND END AND CAUSE
AND GLIMPSE NOT THE IMMENSE INTENT THEY SERVE
IN THIS NETHER LIFE OF MAN DRAB-HUED AND DULL
YET FILLED WITH POIGNANT SMALL IGNOBLE THINGS
THE CONSCIOUS DOLL IS PUSHED A HUNDRED WAYS
AND FEELS THE PUSH BUT NOT THE HANDS THAT DRIVE
FOR NONE CAN SEE THE MASKED IRONIC TROUPE
TO WHOM OUR FIGURE-SELVES ARE MARIONETTES
OUR DEEDS UNWITTING MOVEMENTS IN THEIR GRASP
OUR PASSIONATE STRIFE AN ENTERTAINMENT'S SCENE
IGNORANT THEMSELVES OF THEIR OWN FOUNT OF STRENGTH
THEY PLAY THEIR PART IN THE ENORMOUS WHOLE
AGENTS OF DARKNESS IMITATING LIGHT
SPIRITS OBSCURE AND MOVING THINGS OBSCURE
UNWILLINGLY THEY SERVE A MIGHTIER POWER
ANANKE'S ENGINES ORGANISING CHANCE
CHANNELS PERVERSE OF A STUPENDOUS WILL
TOOLS OF THE UNKNOWN WHO USE US AS THEIR TOOLS
INVESTED WITH POWER IN NATURE'S NETHER STATE
INTO THE ACTIONS MORTALS THINK THEIR OWN
THEY BRING THE INCOHERENCIES OF FATE
OR MAKE A DOOM OF TIME'S SLIPSHOD CAPRICE
AND TOSS THE LIVES OF MEN FROM HAND TO HAND
IN AN INCONSEQUENT AND DEVIOUS GAME
163
AGAINST ALL HIGHER TRUTH THEIR STUFF REBELS
ONLY TO TITAN FORCE THEIR WILL LIES PRONE
INORDINATE THEIR HOLD ON HUMAN HEARTS
IN ALL OUR NATURE'S TURNS THEY INTERVENE
INSIGNIFICANT ARCHITECTS OF LOW-BUILT LIVES
AND ENGINEERS OF INTEREST AND DESIRE
OUT OF CRUDE EARTHINESS AND MUDDY THRILLS
AND COARSE REACTIONS OF MATERIAL NERVE
THEY BUILD OUR HUDDLED STRUCTURES OF SELF-WILL
AND THE ILL-LIGHTED MANSIONS OF OUR THOUGHT
OR WITH THE EGO'S FACTORIES AND MARTS
SURROUND THE BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE OF THE SOUL
ARTISTS MINUTE OF THE HUES OF LITTLENESS
THEY SET THE MOSAIC OF OUR COMEDY
OR PLAN THE TRIVIAL TRAGEDY OF OUR DAYS
ARRANGE THE DEED COMBINE THE CIRCUMSTANCE
AND THE FANTASIA OF THE MOODS COSTUME
THESE UNWISE PROMPTERS OF MAN'S IGNORANT HEART
AND TUTORS OF HIS STUMBLING SPEECH AND WILL
MOVERS OF PETTY WRATHS AND LUSTS AND HATES
AND CHANGEFUL THOUGHTS AND SHALLOW EMOTION'S STARTS
THESE SLIGHT ILLUSION-MAKERS WITH THEIR MASKS
PAINTERS OF THE DECOR OF A DULL-HUED STAGE
AND NIMBLE SCENE-SHIFTERS OF THE HUMAN PLAY
EVER ARE BUSY WITH THIS ILL-LIT SCENE
OURSELVES INCAPABLE TO BUILD OUR FATE
ONLY AS ACTORS SPEAK AND STRUT OUR PARTS
UNTIL THE PIECE IS DONE AND WE PASS OFF
INTO A BRIGHTER TIME AND SUBTLER SPACE
THUS THEY INFLICT THEIR LITTLE PIGMY LAW
AND CURB THE MOUNTING SLOW UPRISE OF MAN
THEN HIS TOO SCANTY WALK WITH DEATH THEY CLOSE
THIS IS THE EPHEMERAL CREATURE'S DAILY LIFE
AS LONG AS THE HUMAN ANIMAL IS LORD
AND A DENSE NETHER NATURE SCREENS THE SOUL
164
AS LONG AS INTELLECT'S OUTWARD-GAZING SIGHT
SERVES EARTHY INTEREST AND CREATURE JOYS
AN INCURABLE LITTLENESS PURSUES HIS DAYS
EVER SINCE CONSCIOUSNESS WAS BORN ON EARTH
LIFE IS THE SAME IN INSECT APE AND MAN
ITS STUFF UNCHANGED ITS WAY THE COMMON ROUTE
IF NEW DESIGNS IF RICHER DETAILS GROW
AND THOUGHT IS ADDED AND MORE TANGLED CARES
IF LITTLE BY LITTLE IT WEARS A BRIGHTER FACE
STILL EVEN IN MAN THE PLOT IS MEAN AND POOR
A GROSS CONTENT PROLONGS HIS FALLEN STATE
HIS SMALL SUCCESSES ARE FAILURES OF THE SOUL
HIS LITTLE PLEASURES PUNCTUATE FREQUENT GRIEFS
HARDSHIP AND TOIL ARE THE HEAVY PRICE HE PAYS
FOR THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND HIS LAST WAGES DEATH
AN INERTIA SUNK TOWARDS INCONSCIENCE
A SLEEP THAT IMITATES DEATH IS HIS REPOSE
A PUNY SPLENDOUR OF CREATIVE FORCE
IS MADE HIS SPUR TO FRAGILE HUMAN WORKS
WHICH YET OUTLAST THEIR BRIEF CREATOR'S BREATH
HE DREAMS SOMETIMES OF THE REVELS OF THE GODS
AND SEES THE DIONYSIAN GESTURE PASS
A LEONINE GREATNESS THAT WOULD TEAR HIS SOUL
IF THROUGH HIS FAILING LIMBS AND FAINTING HEART
THE SWEET AND JOYFUL MIGHTY MADNESS SWEPT
TRIVIAL AMUSEMENTS STIMULATE AND WASTE
THE ENERGY GIVEN TO HIM TO GROW AND BE
HIS LITTLE HOUR IS SPENT IN LITTLE THINGS
A BRIEF COMPANIONSHIP WITH MANY JARS
A LITTLE LOVE AND JEALOUSY AND HATE
A TOUCH OF FRIENDSHIP MID INDIFFERENT CROWDS
DRAW HIS HEART-PLAN ON LIFE'S DIMINUTIVE MAP
IF SOMETHING GREAT AWAKES TOO FRAIL HIS PITCH
TO REVEAL ITS ZENITH TENSION OF DELIGHT
HIS THOUGHT TO ETERNISE ITS EPHEMERAL SOAR
ART'S BRILLIANT GLEAM IS A PASTIME FOR HIS EYES
165
A THRILL THAT SMITES THE NERVES IS MUSIC'S SPELL
AMIDST HIS HARASSED TOIL AND WELTER OF CARES
PRESSED BY THE LABOUR OF HIS CROWDING THOUGHTS
HE DRAWS SOMETIMES AROUND HIS ACHING BROW
NATURE'S CALM MIGHTY HANDS TO HEAL HIS LIFE-PAIN
HE IS SAVED BY HER SILENCE FROM HIS RACK OF SELF
IN HER TRANQUIL BEAUTY IS HIS PUREST BLISS
A NEW LIFE DAWNS HE LOOKS OUT FROM VISTAS WIDE
THE SPIRIT'S BREATH MOVES HIM BUT SOON RETIRES
HIS STRENGTH WAS NOT MADE TO HOLD THAT PUISSANT GUEST
ALL DULLS DOWN TO CONVENTION AND ROUTINE
OR A FIERCE EXCITEMENT BRINGS HIM VIVID JOYS
HIS DAYS ARE TINGED WITH THE RED HUE OF STRIFE
AND LUST'S HOT GLARE AND PASSION'S CRIMSON STAIN
BATTLE AND MURDER ARE HIS TRIBAL GAME
TIME HAS HE NONE TO TURN HIS EYES WITHIN
AND LOOK FOR HIS LOST SELF AND HIS DEAD SOUL
HIS MOTION ON TOO SHORT AN AXIS WHEELS
HE CANNOT SOAR BUT CREEPS ON HIS LONG ROAD
OR IF IMPATIENT OF THE TRUDGE OF TIME
HE WOULD MAKE A SPLENDID HASTE ON FATE'S SLOW ROAD
HIS HEART THAT RUNS SOON PANTS AND TIRES AND SINKS
OR HE WALKS EVER ON AND FINDS NO END
HARDLY A FEW CAN CLIMB TO GREATER LIFE
ALL TUNES TO A LOW SCALE AND CONSCIOUS PITCH
HIS KNOWLEDGE DWELLS IN THE HOUSE OF IGNORANCE
HIS FORCE NEARS NOT EVEN ONCE THE OMNIPOTENT
RARE ARE HIS VISITS OF HEAVENLY ECSTASY
THE BLISS WHICH SLEEPS IN THINGS AND TRIES TO WAKE
BREAKS OUT IN HIM IN A SMALL JOY OF LIFE
THIS SCANTY GRACE IS HIS PERSISTENT STAY
IT LIGHTENS THE BURDEN OF HIS MANY ILLS
AND RECONCILES HIM TO HIS LITTLE WORLD
HE IS SATISFIED WITH HIS COMMON AVERAGE KIND
TOMORROW'S HOPES AND HIS OLD ROUNDS OF THOUGHT
HIS OLD FAMILIAR INTERESTS AND DESIRES
166
HE HAS MADE INTO A THICK AND NARROWING HEDGE
DEFENDING HIS SMALL LIFE FROM THE INVISIBLE
HIS BEING'S KINSHIP TO INFINITY
HE HAS SHUT AWAY FROM HIM INTO INMOST SELF
FENCED OFF THE GREATNESSES OF HIDDEN GOD
HIS BEING WAS FORMED TO PLAY A TRIVIAL PART
IN A LITTLE DRAMA ON A PETTY STAGE
IN A NARROW PLOT HE HAS PITCHED HIS TENT OF LIFE
BENEATH THE WIDE GAZE OF THE STARRY VAST
HE IS THE CROWN OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE
THUS IS CREATION'S LABOUR JUSTIFIED
THIS IS THE WORLD'S RESULT NATURE'S LAST POISE
AND IF THIS WERE ALL AND NOTHING MORE WERE MEANT
IF WHAT NOW SEEMS WERE THE WHOLE OF WHAT MUST BE
IF THIS WERE NOT A STADE THROUGH WHICH WE PASS
ON OUR ROAD FROM MATTER TO ETERNAL SELF
TO THE LIGHT THAT MADE THE WORLDS THE CAUSE OF THINGS
WELL MIGHT INTERPRET OUR MIND'S LIMITED VIEW
EXISTENCE AS AN ACCIDENT IN TIME
ILLUSION OR PHENOMENON OR FREAK
THE PARADOX OF A CREATIVE THOUGHT
WHICH MOVES BETWEEN UNREAL OPPOSITES
INANIMATE FORCE STRUGGLING TO FEEL AND KNOW
MATTER THAT CHANCED TO READ ITSELF BY MIND
INCONSCIENCE MONSTROUSLY ENGENDERING SOUL
AT TIMES ALL LOOKS UNREAL AND REMOTE
WE SEEM TO LIVE IN A FICTION OF OUR THOUGHTS
PIECED FROM SENSATION'S FANCIFUL TRAVELLER'S TALE
OR CAUGHT ON THE FILM OF THE RECORDING BRAIN
A FIGMENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE IN COSMIC SLEEP
A SOMNAMBULIST WALKING UNDER THE MOON
AN IMAGE OF EGO TREADS THROUGH AN IGNORANT DREAM
COUNTING THE MOMENTS OF A SPECTRAL TIME
IN A FALSE PERSPECTIVE OF EFFECT AND CAUSE
TRUSTING TO A SPECIOUS PROSPECT OF WORLD-SPACE
IT DRIFTS INCESSANTLY FROM SCENE TO SCENE
167
WHITHER IT KNOWS NOT TO WHAT FABULOUS VERGE
ALL HERE IS DREAMED OR DOUBTFULLY EXISTS
BUT WHO THE DREAMER IS AND WHENCE HE LOOKS
IS STILL UNKNOWN OR ONLY A SHADOWY GUESS
OR THE WORLD IS REAL BUT OURSELVES TOO SMALL
INSUFFICIENT FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF OUR STAGE
A THIN LIFE-CURVE CROSSES THE TITAN WHIRL
OF THE ORBIT OF A SOULLESS UNIVERSE
AND IN THE BELLY OF THE SPARSE ROLLING MASS
A MIND LOOKS OUT FROM A SMALL CASUAL GLOBE
AND WONDERS WHAT ITSELF AND ALL THINGS ARE
AND YET TO SOME INTERNED SUBJECTIVE SIGHT
THAT STRANGELY HAS FORMED IN MATTER'S SIGHTLESS STUFF
A POINTILLAGE MINUTE OF LITTLE SELF
TAKES FIGURE AS WORLD-BEING'S CONSCIOUS BASE
SUCH IS OUR SCENE IN THE HALF-LIGHT BELOW
THIS IS THE SIGN OF MATTER'S INFINITE
THIS THE WEIRD PURPORT OF THE PICTURE SHOWN
TO SCIENCE THE GIANTESS MEASURER OF HER FIELD
AS SHE PORES ON THE RECORD OF HER CLOSE SURVEY
AND MATHEMATISES HER HUGE EXTERNAL WORLD
TO REASON BOUND WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF SENSE
OR IN THOUGHT'S BROAD IMPALPABLE EXCHANGE
A SPECULATOR IN TENUOUS VAST IDEAS
ABSTRACTIONS IN THE VOID HER CURRENCY
WE KNOW NOT WITH WHAT FIRM VALUES FOR ITS BASE
ONLY RELIGION IN THIS BANKRUPTCY
PRESENTS ITS DUBIOUS RICHES TO OUR HEARTS
OR SIGNS UNPROVISIONED CHEQUES ON THE BEYOND
OUR POVERTY SHALL THERE HAVE ITS REVENGE
OUR SPIRITS DEPART DISCARDING A FUTILE LIFE
INTO THE BLANK UNKNOWN OR WITH THEM TAKE
DEATH'S PASSPORT INTO IMMORTALITY
YET WAS THIS ONLY A PROVISIONAL SCHEME
A FALSE APPEARANCE SKETCHED BY LIMITING SENSE
168
MIND'S INSUFFICIENT SELF-DISCOVERY
AN EARLY ATTEMPT A FIRST EXPERIMENT
THIS WAS A TOY TO AMUSE THE INFANT EARTH
BUT KNOWLEDGE ENDS NOT IN THESE SURFACE POWERS
THAT LIVE UPON A LEDGE IN THE IGNORANCE
AND DARE NOT LOOK INTO THE DANGEROUS DEPTHS
OR TO STARE UPWARD MEASURING THE UNKNOWN
THERE IS A DEEPER SEEING FROM WITHIN
AND WHEN WE HAVE LEFT THESE SMALL PURLIEUS OF MIND
A GREATER VISION MEETS US ON THE HEIGHTS
IN THE LUMINOUS WIDENESS OF THE SPIRIT'S GAZE
AT LAST THERE WAKES IN US A WITNESS SOUL
THAT LOOKS AT TRUTHS UNSEEN AND SCANS THE UNKNOWN
THEN ALL ASSUMES A NEW AND MARVELLOUS FACE
THE WORLD QUIVERS WITH A GOD-LIGHT AT ITS CORE
IN TIME'S DEEP HEART HIGH PURPOSES MOVE AND LIVE
LIFE'S BORDERS CRUMBLE AND JOIN INFINITY
THIS BROAD CONFUSED YET RIGID SCHEME BECOMES
A MAGNIFICENT IMBROGLIO OF THE GODS
A GAME A WORK AMBIGUOUSLY DIVINE
OUR SEEKINGS ARE SHORT-LIVED EXPERIMENTS
MADE BY A WORDLESS AND INSCRUTABLE POWER
TESTING ITS ISSUES FROM INCONSCIENT NIGHT
TO MEET ITS LUMINOUS SELF OF TRUTH AND BLISS
IT PEERS AT THE REAL THROUGH THE APPARENT FORM
IT LABOURS IN OUR MORTAL MIND AND SENSE
AMID THE FIGURES OF THE IGNORANCE
IN THE SYMBOL PICTURES DRAWN BY WORD AND THOUGHT
IT SEEKS THE TRUTH TO WHICH ALL FIGURES POINT
IT LOOKS FOR THE SOURCE OF LIGHT WITH VISION'S LAMP
IT WORKS TO FIND THE DOER OF ALL WORKS
THE UNFELT SELF WITHIN WHO IS THE GUIDE
THE UNKNOWN SELF ABOVE WHO IS THE GOAL
ALL IS NOT HERE A BLINDED NATURE'S TASK
A WORD A WISDOM WATCHES US FROM ON HIGH
A WITNESS SANCTIONING HER WILL AND WORKS
169
AN EYE UNSEEN IN THE UNSEEING VAST
THERE IS AN INFLUENCE FROM A LIGHT ABOVE
THERE ARE THOUGHTS REMOTE AND SEALED ETERNITIES
A MYSTIC MOTIVE DRIVES THE STARS AND SUNS
IN THIS PASSAGE FROM A DEAF UNKNOWING FORCE
TO STRUGGLING CONSCIOUSNESS AND TRANSIENT BREATH
A MIGHTY SUPERNATURE WAITS ON TIME
THE WORLD IS OTHER THAN WE NOW THINK AND SEE
OUR LIVES A DEEPER MYSTERY THAN WE HAVE DREAMED
OUR MINDS ARE STARTERS IN THE RACE TO GOD
OUR SOULS DEPUTED SELVES OF THE SUPREME
ACROSS THE COSMIC FIELD THROUGH NARROW LANES
ASKING A SCANTY DOLE FROM FORTUNE'S HANDS
AND GARBED IN BEGGAR'S ROBES THERE WALKS THE ONE
EVEN IN THE THEATRE OF THESE SMALL LIVES
BEHIND THE ACT A SECRET SWEETNESS BREATHES
AN URGE OF MINIATURE DIVINITY
A MYSTIC PASSION FROM THE WELLS OF GOD
FLOWS THROUGH THE GUARDED SPACES OF THE SOUL
A FORCE THAT HELPS SUPPORTS THE SUFFERING EARTH
AN UNSEEN NEARNESS AND A HIDDEN JOY
THERE ARE MUFFLED THROBS OF LAUGHTER'S UNDERTONES
THE MURMUR OF AN OCCULT HAPPINESS
AN EXULTATION IN THE DEPTHS OF SLEEP
A HEART OF BLISS WITHIN A WORLD OF PAIN
AN INFANT NURSED ON NATURE'S COVERT BREAST
AN INFANT PLAYING IN THE MAGIC WOODS
FLUTING TO RAPTURE BY THE SPIRIT'S STREAMS
AWAITS THE HOUR WHEN WE SHALL TURN TO HIS CALL
IN THIS INVESTITURE OF FLESHLY LIFE
A SOUL THAT IS A SPARK OF GOD SURVIVES
AND SOMETIMES IT BREAKS THROUGH THE SORDID SCREEN
AND KINDLES A FIRE THAT MAKES US HALF-DIVINE
IN OUR BODY'S CELLS THERE SITS A HIDDEN POWER
THAT SEES THE UNSEEN AND PLANS ETERNITY
OUR SMALLEST PARTS HAVE ROOM FOR DEEPEST NEEDS
170
THERE TOO THE GOLDEN MESSENGERS CAN COME
A DOOR IS CUT IN THE MUD WALL OF SELF
ACROSS THE LOWLY THRESHOLD WITH BOWED HEADS
ANGELS OF ECSTASY AND SELF-GIVING PASS
AND LODGED IN AN INNER SANCTUARY OF DREAM
THE MAKERS OF THE IMAGE OF DEITY LIVE
PITY IS THERE AND FIRE-WINGED SACRIFICE
AND FLASHES OF SYMPATHY AND TENDERNESS
CAST HEAVEN-LIGHTS FROM THE HEART'S SECLUDED SHRINE
A WORK IS DONE IN THE DEEP SILENCES
A GLORY AND WONDER OF SPIRITUAL SENSE
A LAUGHTER IN BEAUTY'S EVERLASTING SPACE
TRANSFORMING WORLD-EXPERIENCE INTO JOY
INHABIT THE MYSTERY OF THE UNTOUCHED GULFS
LULLED BY TIME'S BEATS ETERNITY SLEEPS IN US
IN THE SEALED HERMETIC HEART THE HAPPY CORE
UNMOVED BEHIND THIS OUTER SHAPE OF DEATH
THE ETERNAL ENTITY PREPARES WITHIN
ITS MATTER OF DIVINE FELICITY
ITS REIGN OF HEAVENLY PHENOMENON
EVEN IN OUR SCEPTIC MIND OF IGNORANCE
A FORESIGHT COMES OF SOME IMMENSE RELEASE
OUR WILL LIFTS TOWARDS IT SLOW AND SHAPING HANDS
EACH PART IN US DESIRES ITS ABSOLUTE
OUR THOUGHTS COVET THE EVERLASTING LIGHT
OUR STRENGTH DERIVES FROM AN OMNIPOTENT FORCE
AND SINCE FROM A VEILED GOD-JOY THE WORLDS WERE MADE
AND SINCE ETERNAL BEAUTY ASKS FOR FORM
EVEN HERE WHERE ALL IS MADE OF BEING'S DUST
OUR HEARTS ARE CAPTURED BY ENSNARING SHAPES
OUR VERY SENSES BLINDLY SEEK FOR BLISS
OUR ERROR CRUCIFIES REALITY
TO FORCE ITS BIRTH AND DIVINE BODY HERE
COMPELLING INCARNATE IN A HUMAN FORM
AND BREATHING IN LIMBS THAT ONE CAN TOUCH AND CLASP
ITS KNOWLEDGE TO RESCUE AN ANCIENT IGNORANCE
171
ITS SAVIOUR LIGHT THE INCONSCIENT UNIVERSE
AND WHEN THAT GREATER SELF COMES SEA-LIKE DOWN
TO FILL THIS IMAGE OF OUR TRANSIENCE
ALL SHALL BE CAPTURED BY DELIGHT TRANSFORMED
IN WAVES OF UNDREAMED ECSTASY SHALL ROLL
OUR MIND AND LIFE AND SENSE AND LAUGH IN A LIGHT
OTHER THAN THIS HARD LIMITED HUMAN DAY
THE BODY'S TISSUES THRILL APOTHEOSISED
ITS CELLS SUSTAIN BRIGHT METAMORPHOSIS
THIS LITTLE BEING OF TIME THIS SHADOW SOUL
THIS LIVING DWARF-FIGUREHEAD OF DARKENED SPIRIT
OUT OF ITS TRAFFIC IN PETTY DREAMS SHALL RISE
ITS SHAPE OF PERSON AND ITS EGO-FACE
DIVESTED OF THIS MORTAL TRAVESTY
LIKE A CLAY TROLL KNEADED INTO A GOD
NEW-MADE IN THE IMAGE OF THE ETERNAL GUEST
IT SHALL BE CAUGHT TO THE BREAST OF A WHITE FORCE
AND FLAMING WITH THE PARADISAL TOUCH
IN A ROSE-FIRE OF SWEET SPIRITUAL GRACE
IN THE RED PASSION OF ITS INFINITE CHANGE
QUIVER AWAKE AND SHUDDER WITH ECSTASY
AS IF REVERSING A DEFORMATION'S SPELL
RELEASED FROM THE BLACK MAGIC OF THE NIGHT
RENOUNCING SERVITUDE TO THE DIM ABYSS
IT SHALL LEARN AT LAST WHO LIVED WITHIN UNSEEN
AND SEIZED WITH MARVEL IN THE ADORING HEART
TO THE ENTHRONED CHILD-GODHEAD KNEEL AWARE
TREMBLING WITH BEAUTY AND DELIGHT AND LOVE
BUT FIRST THE SPIRIT'S ASCENT WE MUST ACHIEVE
OUT OF THE CHASM FROM WHICH OUR NATURE ROSE
THE SOUL MUST SOAR SOVEREIGN ABOVE THE FORM
AND CLIMB TO SUMMITS BEYOND MIND'S HALF-SLEEP
OUR HEARTS WE MUST INFORM WITH HEAVENLY STRENGTH
SURPRISE THE ANIMAL WITH THE OCCULT GOD
THEN KINDLING THE GOLD TONGUE OF SACRIFICE
CALLING THE POWERS OF A BRIGHT HEMISPHERE
172
WE SHALL SHED THE DISCREDIT OF OUR MORTAL STATE
MAKE THE ABYSM A ROAD FOR HEAVEN'S DESCENT
ACQUAINT OUR DEPTHS WITH THE SUPERNAL RAY
AND CLEAVE THE DARKNESS WITH THE MYSTIC FIRE
ADVENTURING ONCE MORE IN THE NATAL MIST
ACROSS THE DANGEROUS HAZE THE PREGNANT STIR
HE THROUGH THE ASTRAL CHAOS SHORE A WAY
MID THE GREY FACES OF ITS DEMON GODS
QUESTIONED BY WHISPERS OF ITS FLICKERING GHOSTS
BESIEGED BY SORCERIES OF ITS FLUENT FORCE
AS ONE WHO WALKS UNGUIDED THROUGH STRANGE FIELDS
TENDING HE KNOWS NOT WHERE NOR WITH WHAT HOPE
HE TROD A SOIL THAT FAILED BENEATH HIS FEET
AND JOURNEYED IN STONE STRENGTH TO A FUGITIVE END
HIS TRAIL BEHIND HIM WAS A VANISHING LINE
OF GLIMMERING POINTS IN A VAGUE IMMENSITY
A BODILESS MURMUR TRAVELLED AT HIS SIDE
IN THE WOUNDED GLOOM COMPLAINING AGAINST LIGHT
A HUGE OBSTRUCTION ITS IMMOBILE HEART
THE WATCHING OPACITY MULTIPLIED AS HE MOVED
ITS HOSTILE MASS OF DEAD AND STARING EYES
THE DARKNESS GLIMMERED LIKE A DYING TORCH
AROUND HIM AN EXTINGUISHED PHANTOM GLOW
PEOPLED WITH SHADOWY AND MISLEADING SHAPES
THE VAGUE INCONSCIENT'S DARK AND MEASURELESS CAVE
HIS ONLY SUNLIGHT WAS HIS SPIRIT'S FLAME
173
AS ONE WHO BETWEEN DIM RECEDING WALLS
TOWARDS THE FAR GLEAM OF A TUNNEL'S MOUTH
HOPING FOR LIGHT WALKS NOW WITH FREER PACE
AND FEELS APPROACH A BREATH OF WIDER AIR
SO HE ESCAPED FROM THAT GREY ANARCHY
INTO AN INEFFECTUAL WORLD HE CAME
A PURPOSELESS REGION OF ARRESTED BIRTH
WHERE BEING FROM NON-BEING FLED AND DARED
TO LIVE BUT HAD NO STRENGTH LONG TO ABIDE
ABOVE THERE GLEAMED A PONDERING BROW OF SKY
TORMENTED CROSSED BY WINGS OF DOUBTFUL HAZE
ADVENTURING WITH A VOICE OF ROAMING WINDS
AND CRYING FOR A DIRECTION IN THE VOID
LIKE BLIND SOULS LOOKING FOR THE SELVES THEY LOST
AND WANDERING THROUGH UNFAMILIAR WORLDS
WINGS OF VAGUE QUESTIONING MET THE QUERY OF SPACE
AFTER DENIAL DAWNED A DUBIOUS HOPE
A HOPE OF SELF AND FORM AND LEAVE TO LIVE
AND THE BIRTH OF THAT WHICH NEVER YET COULD BE
AND JOY OF THE MIND'S HAZARD THE HEART'S CHOICE
GRACE OF THE UNKNOWN AND HANDS OF SUDDEN SURPRISE
AND A TOUCH OF SURE DELIGHT IN UNSURE THINGS
TO A STRANGE UNCERTAIN TRACT HIS JOURNEY CAME
WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS PLAYED WITH UNCONSCIOUS SELF
AND BIRTH WAS AN ATTEMPT OR EPISODE
A CHARM DREW NEAR THAT COULD NOT KEEP ITS SPELL
AN EAGER POWER THAT COULD NOT FIND ITS WAY
A CHANCE THAT CHOSE A STRANGE ARITHMETIC
BUT COULD NOT BIND WITH IT THE FORMS IT MADE
A MULTITUDE THAT COULD NOT GUARD ITS SUM
WHICH LESS THAN ZERO GREW AND MORE THAN ONE
174
ARRIVING AT A LARGE AND SHADOWY SENSE
THAT CARED NOT TO DEFINE ITS FLEETING DRIFT
LIFE LABOURED IN A STRANGE AND MYTHIC AIR
DENUDED OF HER SWEET MAGNIFICENT SUNS
IN WORLDS IMAGINED NEVER YET MADE TRUE
A LINGERING GLIMMER ON CREATION'S VERGE
ONE STRAYED AND DREAMED AND NEVER STOPPED TO ACHIEVE
TO ACHIEVE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THAT MAGIC SPACE
THE MARVELS OF A TWILIGHT WONDERLAND
FULL OF A BEAUTY STRANGELY VAINLY MADE
A SURGE OF FANCIFUL REALITIES
DIM TOKENS OF A SPLENDOUR SEALED ABOVE
AWOKE THE PASSION OF THE EYES' DESIRE
COMPELLED BELIEF ON THE ENAMOURED THOUGHT
AND DREW THE HEART BUT LED IT TO NO GOAL
A MAGIC FLOWED AS IF OF MOVING SCENES
THAT KEPT AWHILE THEIR FUGITIVE DELICACY
OF SPARING LINES LIMNED BY AN ABSTRACT ART
IN A RARE SCANTED LIGHT WITH FAINT DREAM-BRUSH
ON A SILVER BACKGROUND OF INCERTITUDE
AN INFANT GLOW OF HEAVENS NEAR TO MORN
A FIRE INTENSE CONCEIVED BUT NEVER LIT
CARESSED THE AIR WITH ARDENT HINTS OF DAY
THE PERFECT LONGING FOR IMPERFECTION'S CHARM
THE ILLUMINED CAUGHT BY THE SNARE OF IGNORANCE
ETHEREAL CREATURES DRAWN BY BODY'S LURE
TO THAT REGION OF PROMISE BEATING INVISIBLE WINGS
CAME HUNGRY FOR THE JOY OF FINITE LIFE
BUT TOO DIVINE TO TREAD CREATED SOIL
AND SHARE THE FATE OF PERISHABLE THINGS
THE CHILDREN OF THE UNEMBODIED GLEAM
ARISEN FROM A FORMLESS THOUGHT IN THE SOUL
AND CHASED BY AN IMPERISHABLE DESIRE
TRAVERSED THE FIELD OF THE PURSUING GAZE
A WILL THAT UNPERSISTING FAILED WORKED THERE
LIFE WAS A SEARCH BUT FINDING NEVER CAME
175
THERE NOTHING SATISFIED BUT ALL ALLURED
THINGS SEEMED TO BE THAT NEVER WHOLLY ARE
IMAGES WERE SEEN THAT LOOKED LIKE LIVING ACTS
AND SYMBOLS HID THE SENSE THEY CLAIMED TO SHOW
PALE DREAMS GREW REAL TO THE DREAMER'S EYES
THE SOULS CAME THERE THAT VAINLY STRIVE FOR BIRTH
AND SPIRITS ENTRAPPED MIGHT WANDER THROUGH ALL TIME
YET NEVER FIND THE TRUTH BY WHICH THEY LIVE
ALL RAN LIKE HOPES THAT HUNT A LURKING CHANCE
NOTHING WAS SOLID NOTHING FELT COMPLETE
ALL WAS UNSAFE MIRACULOUS AND HALF-TRUE
IT SEEMED A REALM OF LIVES THAT HAD NO BASE
THEN DAWNED A GREATER SEEKING BROADENED SKY
A JOURNEY UNDER WINGS OF BROODING FORCE
FIRST CAME THE KINGDOM OF THE MORNING STAR
A TWILIGHT BEAUTY TREMBLED UNDER ITS SPEAR
AND THE THROB OF PROMISE OF A WIDER LIFE
THEN SLOWLY ROSE A GREAT AND DOUBTING SUN
AND IN ITS LIGHT SHE MADE OF SELF A WORLD
A SPIRIT WAS THERE THAT SOUGHT FOR ITS OWN DEEP SELF
YET WAS CONTENT WITH FRAGMENTS PUSHED IN FRONT
AND PARTS OF LIVING THAT BELIED THE WHOLE
BUT PIECED TOGETHER MIGHT ONE DAY BE TRUE
YET SOMETHING SEEMED TO BE ACHIEVED AT LAST
A GROWING VOLUME OF THE WILL-TO-BE
A TEXT OF LIVING AND A GRAPH OF FORCE
A SCRIPT OF ACTS A SONG OF CONSCIOUS FORMS
BURDENED WITH MEANINGS FUGITIVE FROM THOUGHT'S GRASP
AND CROWDED WITH UNDERTONES OF LIFE'S RHYTHMIC CRY
COULD WRITE ITSELF ON THE HEARTS OF LIVING THINGS
IN AN OUTBREAK OF THE MIGHT OF SECRET SPIRIT
IN LIFE AND MATTER'S ANSWER OF DELIGHT
SOME FACE OF DEATHLESS BEAUTY COULD BE CAUGHT
THAT GAVE IMMORTALITY TO A MOMENT'S JOY
SOME WORD THAT COULD INCARNATE HIGHEST TRUTH
176
LEAPED OUT FROM A CHANCE TENSION OF THE SOUL
SOME HUE OF THE ABSOLUTE COULD FALL ON LIFE
SOME GLORY OF KNOWLEDGE AND INTUITIVE SIGHT
SOME PASSION OF THE RAPTUROUS HEART OF LOVE
A HIEROPHANT OF THE BODILESS SECRECY
INTERNED IN AN UNSEEN SPIRITUAL SHEATH
THE WILL THAT PUSHES SENSE BEYOND ITS SCOPE
TO FEEL THE LIGHT AND JOY INTANGIBLE
HALF FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE INEFFABLE'S PEACE
HALF CAPTURED A SEALED SWEETNESS OF DESIRE
THAT YEARNED FROM A BOSOM OF MYSTERIOUS BLISS
HALF MANIFESTED VEILED REALITY
A SOUL NOT WRAPPED INTO ITS CLOAK OF MIND
COULD GLIMPSE THE TRUE SENSE OF A WORLD OF FORMS
ILLUMINED BY A VISION IN THE THOUGHT
UPBUOYED BY THE HEART'S UNDERSTANDING FLAME
IT COULD HOLD IN THE CONSCIOUS ETHER OF THE SPIRIT
THE DIVINITY OF A SYMBOL UNIVERSE
THIS REALM INSPIRES US WITH OUR VASTER HOPES
ITS FORCES HAVE MADE LANDINGS ON OUR GLOBE
ITS SIGNS HAVE TRACED THEIR PATTERN IN OUR LIVES
IT LENDS A SOVEREIGN MOVEMENT TO OUR FATE
ITS ERRANT WAVES MOTIVE OUR LIFE'S HIGH SURGE
ALL THAT WE SEEK FOR IS PREFIGURED THERE
AND ALL WE HAVE NOT KNOWN NOR EVER SOUGHT
WHICH YET ONE DAY MUST BE BORN IN HUMAN HEARTS
THAT THE TIMELESS MAY FULFIL ITSELF IN THINGS
INCARNATE IN THE MYSTERY OF THE DAYS
ETERNAL IN AN UNCLOSED INFINITE
A MOUNTING ENDLESS POSSIBILITY
CLIMBS HIGH UPON A TOPLESS LADDER OF DREAM
FOR EVER IN THE BEING'S CONSCIOUS TRANCE
ALL ON THAT LADDER MOUNTS TO AN UNSEEN END
AN ENERGY OF PERPETUAL TRANSIENCE MAKES
THE JOURNEY FROM WHICH NO RETURN IS SURE
THE PILGRIMAGE OF NATURE TO THE UNKNOWN
177
AS IF IN HER ASCENT TO HER LOST SOURCE
SHE HOPED TO UNROLL ALL THAT COULD EVER BE
HER HIGH PROCESSION MOVES FROM STAGE TO STAGE
A PROGRESS LEAP FROM SIGHT TO GREATER SIGHT
A PROCESS MARCH FROM FORM TO AMPLER FORM
A CARAVAN OF THE INEXHAUSTIBLE
FORMATIONS OF A BOUNDLESS THOUGHT AND FORCE
HER TIMELESS POWER THAT LAY ONCE ON THE LAP
OF A BEGINNINGLESS AND ENDLESS CALM
NOW SEVERED FROM THE SPIRIT'S IMMORTAL BLISS
ERECTS THE TYPE OF ALL THE JOYS SHE HAS LOST
COMPELLING TRANSIENT SUBSTANCE INTO SHAPE
SHE HOPES BY THE CREATIVE ACT'S RELEASE
TO O'ERLEAP SOMETIMES THE GULF SHE CANNOT FILL
TO HEAL AWHILE THE WOUND OF SEVERANCE
ESCAPE FROM THE MOMENT'S PRISON OF LITTLENESS
AND MEET THE ETERNAL'S WIDE SUBLIMITIES
IN THE UNCERTAIN TIME-FIELD PORTIONED HERE
ALMOST SHE NEARS WHAT NEVER CAN BE ATTAINED
SHE SHUTS ETERNITY INTO AN HOUR
AND FILLS A LITTLE SOUL WITH THE INFINITE
THE IMMOBILE LEANS TO THE MAGIC OF HER CALL
SHE STANDS ON A SHORE IN THE ILLIMITABLE
PERCEIVES THE FORMLESS DWELLER IN ALL FORMS
AND FEELS AROUND HER INFINITY'S EMBRACE
HER TASK NO ENDING KNOWS SHE SERVES NO AIM
BUT LABOURS DRIVEN BY A NAMELESS WILL
THAT CAME FROM SOME UNKNOWABLE FORMLESS VAST
THIS IS HER SECRET AND IMPOSSIBLE TASK
TO CATCH THE BOUNDLESS IN A NET OF BIRTH
TO CAST THE SPIRIT INTO PHYSICAL FORM
TO LEND SPEECH AND THOUGHT TO THE INEFFABLE
SHE IS PUSHED TO REVEAL THE EVER UNMANIFEST
YET BY HER SKILL THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS BEEN DONE
SHE FOLLOWS HER SUBLIME IRRATIONAL PLAN
INVENTS DEVICES OF HER MAGIC ART
178
TO FIND NEW BODIES FOR THE INFINITE
AND IMAGES OF THE UNIMAGINABLE
SHE HAS LURED THE ETERNAL INTO THE ARMS OF TIME
EVEN NOW HERSELF SHE KNOWS NOT WHAT SHE HAS DONE
FOR ALL IS WROUGHT BENEATH A BAFFLING MASK
A SEMBLANCE OTHER THAN ITS HIDDEN TRUTH
THE ASPECT WEARS OF AN ILLUSION'S TRICK
A FEIGNED TIME-DRIVEN UNREALITY
THE UNFINISHED CREATION OF A CHANGING SOUL
IN A BODY CHANGING WITH THE INHABITANT
INSIGNIFICANT HER MEANS INFINITE HER WORK
ON A GREAT FIELD OF SHAPELESS CONSCIOUSNESS
IN LITTLE FINITE STROKES OF MIND AND SENSE
AN ENDLESS TRUTH SHE ENDLESSLY UNFOLDS
A TIMELESS MYSTERY WORKS OUT IN TIME
THE GREATNESS SHE HAS DREAMED HER ACTS HAVE MISSED
HER LABOUR IS A PASSION AND A PAIN
A RAPTURE AND PANG HER GLORY AND HER CURSE
AND YET SHE CANNOT CHOOSE BUT LABOURS ON
HER MIGHTY HEART FORBIDS HER TO DESIST
AS LONG AS THE WORLD LASTS HER FAILURE LIVES
ASTONISHING AND FOILING REASON'S GAZE
A FOLLY AND A BEAUTY UNSPEAKABLE
A SUPERB MADNESS OF THE WILL TO LIVE
A DARING A DELIRIUM OF DELIGHT
THIS IS HER BEING'S LAW ITS SOLE RESOURCE
SHE SATES THOUGH SATISFACTION NEVER COMES
HER HUNGRY WILL TO LAVISH EVERYWHERE
HER MANY-IMAGED FICTIONS OF THE SELF
AND THOUSAND FASHIONS OF ONE REALITY
A WORLD SHE MADE TOUCHED BY TRUTH'S FLEEING HEM
A WORLD CAST INTO A DREAM OF WHAT IT SEEKS
AN ICON OF TRUTH A CONSCIOUS MYSTERY'S SHAPE
IT LINGERED NOT LIKE THE EARTH-MIND HEMMED IN
IN SOLID BARRIERS OF APPARENT FACT
IT DARED TO TRUST THE DREAM-MIND AND THE SOUL
179
A HUNTER OF SPIRITUAL VERITIES
STILL ONLY THOUGHT OR GUESSED OR HELD BY FAITH
IT SEIZED IN IMAGINATION AND CONFINED
A PAINTED BIRD OF PARADISE IN A CAGE
THIS GREATER LIFE IS ENAMOURED OF THE UNSEEN
IT CALLS TO SOME HIGHEST LIGHT BEYOND ITS REACH
IT CAN FEEL THE SILENCE THAT ABSOLVES THE SOUL
IT FEELS A SAVIOUR TOUCH A RAY DIVINE
BEAUTY AND GOOD AND TRUTH ITS GODHEADS ARE
IT IS NEAR TO HEAVENLIER HEAVENS THAN EARTH'S EYES SEE
A DIRER DARKNESS THAN MAN'S LIFE CAN BEAR
IT HAS KINSHIP WITH THE DEMON AND THE GOD
A STRANGE ENTHUSIASM HAS MOVED ITS HEART
IT HUNGERS FOR HEIGHTS IT PASSIONS FOR THE SUPREME
IT HUNTS FOR THE PERFECT WORD THE PERFECT SHAPE
IT LEAPS TO THE SUMMIT THOUGHT THE SUMMIT LIGHT
FOR BY THE FORM THE FORMLESS IS BROUGHT CLOSE
AND ALL PERFECTION FRINGES THE ABSOLUTE
A CHILD OF HEAVEN WHO NEVER SAW HIS HOME
ITS IMPETUS MEETS THE ETERNAL AT A POINT
IT CAN ONLY NEAR AND TOUCH IT CANNOT HOLD
IT CAN ONLY STRAIN TOWARDS SOME BRIGHT EXTREME
ITS GREATNESS IS TO SEEK AND TO CREATE
ON EVERY PLANE THIS GREATNESS MUST CREATE
ON EARTH IN HEAVEN IN HELL SHE IS THE SAME
OF EVERY FATE SHE TAKES HER MIGHTY PART
A GUARDIAN OF THE FIRE THAT LIGHTS THE SUNS
SHE TRIUMPHS IN HER GLORY AND HER MIGHT
OPPOSED OPPRESSED SHE BEARS GOD'S URGE TO BE BORN
THE SPIRIT SURVIVES UPON NON-BEING'S GROUND
WORLD-FORCE OUTLASTS WORLD-DISILLUSION'S SHOCK
DUMB SHE IS STILL THE WORD INERT THE POWER
HERE FALLEN A SLAVE OF DEATH AND IGNORANCE
TO THINGS DEATHLESS SHE IS DRIVEN TO ASPIRE
AND MOVED TO KNOW EVEN THE UNKNOWABLE
EVEN NESCIENT NULL HER SLEEP CREATES A WORLD
180
WHEN MOST UNSEEN MOST MIGHTILY SHE WORKS
HOUSED IN THE ATOM BURIED IN THE CLOD
HER QUICK CREATIVE PASSION CANNOT CEASE
INCONSCIENCE IS HER LONG GIGANTIC PAUSE
HER COSMIC SWOON IS A STUPENDOUS PHASE
TIME-BORN SHE HIDES HER IMMORTALITY
IN DEATH HER BED SHE WAITS THE HOUR TO RISE
EVEN WITH THE LIGHT DENIED THAT SENT HER FORTH
AND THE HOPE DEAD SHE NEEDED FOR HER TASK
EVEN WHEN HER BRIGHTEST STARS ARE QUENCHED IN NIGHT
NOURISHED BY HARDSHIP AND CALAMITY
AND WITH PAIN FOR HER BODY'S HANDMAID MASSEUSE NURSE
HER TORTURED INVISIBLE SPIRIT CONTINUES STILL
TO TOIL THOUGH IN DARKNESS TO CREATE THOUGH WITH PANGS
SHE CARRIES CRUCIFIED GOD UPON HER BREAST
IN CHILL INSENTIENT DEPTHS WHERE JOY IS NONE
IMMURED OPPRESSED BY THE RESISTING VOID
WHERE NOTHING MOVES AND NOTHING CAN BECOME
STILL SHE REMEMBERS STILL INVOKES THE SKILL
THE WONDER-WORKER GAVE HER AT HER BIRTH
IMPARTS TO DROWSY FORMLESSNESS A SHAPE
REVEALS A WORLD WHERE NOTHING WAS BEFORE
IN REALMS CONFINED TO A PRONE CIRCLE OF DEATH
TO A DARK ETERNITY OF IGNORANCE
A QUIVER IN AN INERT INCONSCIENT MASS
OR IMPRISONED IN IMMOBILISED WHORLS OF FORCE
BY MATTER'S BLIND COMPULSION DEAF AND MUTE
SHE REFUSES MOTIONLESS IN THE DUST TO SLEEP
THEN FOR HER REBEL WAKING'S PUNISHMENT
GIVEN ONLY HARD MECHANIC CIRCUMSTANCE
AS THE ENGINERY OF HER MAGIC CRAFT
SHE FASHIONS GODLIKE MARVELS OUT OF MUD
IN THE PLASM SHE SETS HER DUMB IMMORTAL URGE
HELPS THE LIVE TISSUE TO THINK THE CLOSED SENSE TO FEEL
FLASHES THROUGH THE FRAIL NERVES POIGNANT MESSAGES
IN A HEART OF FLESH MIRACULOUSLY LOVES
181
TO BRUTE BODIES GIVES A SOUL A WILL A VOICE
EVER SHE SUMMONS AS BY A SORCERER'S WAND
BEINGS AND SHAPES AND SCENES INNUMERABLE
TORCH-BEARERS OF HER POMPS THROUGH TIME AND SPACE
THIS WORLD IS HER LONG JOURNEY THROUGH THE NIGHT
THE SUNS AND PLANETS LAMPS TO LIGHT HER ROAD
OUR REASON IS THE CONFIDANTE OF HER THOUGHTS
OUR SENSES ARE HER VIBRANT WITNESSES
THERE DRAWING HER SIGNS FROM THINGS HALF TRUE HALF FALSE
SHE LABOURS TO REPLACE BY REALISED DREAMS
THE MEMORY OF HER LOST ETERNITY
THESE ARE HER DEEDS IN THIS HUGE WORLD-IGNORANCE
TILL THE VEIL IS LIFTED TILL THE NIGHT IS DEAD
IN LIGHT OR DARK SHE KEEPS HER TIRELESS SEARCH
TIME IS HER ROAD OF ENDLESS PILGRIMAGE
ONE MIGHTY PASSION MOTIVES ALL HER WORKS
HER ETERNAL LOVER IS HER ACTION'S CAUSE
FOR HIM SHE LEAPED FORTH FROM THE UNSEEN VASTS
TO MOVE HERE IN A STARK UNCONSCIOUS WORLD
ITS ACTS ARE HER COMMERCE WITH HER HIDDEN GUEST
HIS MOODS SHE TAKES FOR HER HEART'S PASSIONATE MOULDS
IN BEAUTY SHE TREASURES THE SUNLIGHT OF HIS SMILE
ASHAMED OF HER RICH COSMIC POVERTY
SHE CAJOLES WITH HER SMALL GIFTS HIS MIGHTINESS
HOLDS WITH HER SCENES HIS LOOK'S FIDELITY
AND WOOS HIS LARGE-EYED WANDERING THOUGHTS TO DWELL
IN FIGURES OF HER MILLION-IMPULSED FORCE
ONLY TO ATTRACT HER VEILED COMPANION
AND KEEP HIM CLOSE TO HER BREAST IN HER WORLD-CLOAK
LEST FROM HER ARMS HE TURN TO HIS FORMLESS PEACE
IS HER HEART'S BUSINESS AND HER CLINGING CARE
YET WHEN HE IS MOST NEAR SHE FEELS HIM FAR
FOR CONTRADICTION IS HER NATURE'S LAW
ALTHOUGH SHE IS EVER IN HIM AND HE IN HER
AS IF UNAWARE OF THE ETERNAL TIE
HER WILL IS TO SHUT GOD INTO HER WORKS
182
AND KEEP HIM AS HER CHERISHED PRISONER
THAT NEVER THEY MAY PART AGAIN IN TIME
A SUMPTUOUS CHAMBER OF THE SPIRIT'S SLEEP
AT FIRST SHE MADE A DEEP INTERIOR ROOM
WHERE HE SLUMBERS AS IF A FORGOTTEN GUEST
BUT NOW SHE TURNS TO BREAK THE OBLIVIOUS SPELL
AWAKES THE SLEEPER ON THE SCULPTURED COUCH
SHE FINDS AGAIN THE PRESENCE IN THE FORM
AND IN THE LIGHT THAT WAKES WITH HIM RECOVERS
A MEANING IN THE HURRY AND TRUDGE OF TIME
AND THROUGH THIS MIND THAT ONCE OBSCURED THE SOUL
PASSES A GLINT OF UNSEEN DEITY
ACROSS A LUMINOUS DREAM OF SPIRIT-SPACE
SHE BUILDS CREATION LIKE A RAINBOW BRIDGE
BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL SILENCE AND THE VOID
A NET IS MADE OF THE MOBILE UNIVERSE
SHE WEAVES A SNARE FOR THE CONSCIOUS INFINITE
A KNOWLEDGE IS WITH HER THAT CONCEALS ITS STEPS
AND SEEMS A MUTE OMNIPOTENT IGNORANCE
A MIGHT IS WITH HER THAT MAKES WONDERS TRUE
THE INCREDIBLE IS HER STUFF OF COMMON FACT
HER PURPOSES HER WORKINGS RIDDLES PROVE
EXAMINED THEY GROW OTHER THAN THEY WERE
EXPLAINED THEY SEEM YET MORE INEXPLICABLE
EVEN IN OUR WORLD A MYSTERY HAS REIGNED
EARTH'S CUNNING SCREEN OF TRIVIAL PLAINNESS HIDES
HER LARGER LEVELS ARE OF SORCERIES MADE
THERE THE ENIGMA SHOWS ITS SPLENDID PRISM
THERE IS NO DEEP DISGUISE OF COMMONNESS
OCCULT PROFOUND COMES ALL EXPERIENCE
MARVEL IS EVER NEW MIRACLE DIVINE
THERE IS A SCREENED BURDEN A MYSTERIOUS TOUCH
THERE IS A SECRECY OF HIDDEN SENSE
ALTHOUGH NO EARTHEN MASK WEIGHS ON HER FACE
INTO HERSELF SHE FLEES FROM HER OWN SIGHT
ALL FORMS ARE TOKENS OF SOME VEILED IDEA
183
WHOSE COVERT PURPOSE LURKS FROM MIND'S PURSUIT
YET IS A WOMB OF SOVEREIGN CONSEQUENCE
THERE EVERY THOUGHT AND FEELING IS AN ACT
AND EVERY ACT A SYMBOL AND A SIGN
AND EVERY SYMBOL HIDES A LIVING POWER
A UNIVERSE SHE BUILDS FROM TRUTHS AND MYTHS
BUT WHAT SHE NEEDED MOST SHE CANNOT BUILD
ALL SHOWN IS A FIGURE OR COPY OF THE TRUTH
BUT THE REAL VEILS FROM HER ITS MYSTIC FACE
ALL ELSE SHE FINDS THERE LACKS ETERNITY
ALL IS SOUGHT OUT BUT MISSED THE INFINITE
A CONSCIOUSNESS LIT BY A TRUTH ABOVE
WAS FELT IT SAW THE LIGHT BUT NOT THE TRUTH
IT CAUGHT THE IDEA AND BUILT FROM IT A WORLD
IT MADE AN IMAGE THERE AND CALLED IT GOD
YET SOMETHING TRUE AND INWARD HARBOURED THERE
THE BEINGS OF THAT WORLD OF GREATER LIFE
TENANTS OF A LARGER AIR AND FREER SPACE
LIVE NOT BY THE BODY OR IN OUTWARD THINGS
A DEEPER LIVING WAS THEIR SEAT OF SELF
IN THAT INTENSE DOMAIN OF INTIMACY
OBJECTS DWELL AS COMPANIONS OF THE SOUL
THE BODY'S ACTIONS ARE A MINOR SCRIPT
THE SURFACE RENDERING OF A LIFE WITHIN
ALL FORCES ARE LIFE'S RETINUE IN THAT WORLD
AND THOUGHT AND BODY AS HER HANDMAIDS MOVE
THE UNIVERSAL WIDENESSES GIVE HER ROOM
ALL FEEL THE COSMIC MOVEMENT IN THEIR ACTS
AND ARE THE INSTRUMENTS OF HER COSMIC MIGHT
OR THEIR OWN SELF THEY MAKE THEIR UNIVERSE
IN ALL WHO HAVE RISEN TO A GREATER LIFE
A VOICE OF UNBORN THINGS WHISPERS TO THE EAR
TO THEIR EYES VISITED BY SOME HIGH SUNLIGHT
ASPIRATION SHOWS THE IMAGE OF A CROWN
TO WORK OUT A SEED THAT SHE HAS THROWN WITHIN
184
TO ACHIEVE HER POWER IN THEM HER CREATURES LIVE
EACH IS A GREATNESS GROWING TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS
OR FROM HIS INNER CENTRE OCEANS OUT
IN CIRCLING RIPPLES OF CONCENTRIC POWER
THEY SWALLOW GLUTTED THEIR ENVIRONMENT
EVEN OF THAT LARGENESS MANY A CABIN MAKE
IN NARROWER BREADTHS AND BRIEFER VISTAS PENT
THEY LIVE CONTENT WITH SOME SMALL GREATNESS WON
TO RULE THE LITTLE EMPIRE OF THEMSELVES
TO BE A FIGURE IN THEIR PRIVATE WORLD
AND MAKE THE MILIEU'S JOYS AND GRIEFS THEIR OWN
AND SATISFY THEIR LIFE-MOTIVES AND LIFE-WANTS
IS CHARGE ENOUGH AND OFFICE FOR THIS STRENGTH
A STEWARD OF THE PERSON AND HIS FATE
THIS WAS TRANSITION-LINE AND STARTING-POINT
A FIRST IMMIGRATION INTO HEAVENLINESS
FOR ALL WHO CROSS INTO THAT BRILLIANT SPHERE
THESE ARE THE KINSMEN OF OUR EARTHLY RACE
THIS REGION BORDERS ON OUR MORTAL STATE
THIS WIDER WORLD OUR GREATER MOVEMENTS GIVES
ITS STRONG FORMATIONS BUILD OUR GROWING SELVES
ITS CREATURES ARE OUR BRIGHTER REPLICAS
COMPLETE THE TYPES WE ONLY INITIATE
AND ARE SECURELY WHAT WE STRIVE TO BE
AS IF THOUGHT-OUT ETERNAL CHARACTERS
ENTIRE NOT PULLED AS WE BY CONTRARY TIDES
THEY FOLLOW THE UNSEEN LEADER IN THE HEART
THEIR LIVES OBEY THE INNER NATURE'S LAW
THERE IS KEPT GRANDEUR'S STORE THE HERO'S MOULD
THE SOUL IS THE WATCHFUL BUILDER OF ITS FATE
NONE IS A SPIRIT INDIFFERENT AND INERT
THEY CHOOSE THEIR SIDE THEY SEE THE GOD THEY ADORE
A BATTLE IS JOINED BETWEEN THE TRUE AND FALSE
A PILGRIMAGE SETS OUT TO THE DIVINE LIGHT
FOR EVEN IGNORANCE THERE ASPIRES TO KNOW
AND SHINES WITH THE LUSTRE OF A DISTANT STAR
185
THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE IN THE HEART OF SLEEP
AND NATURE COMES TO THEM AS A CONSCIOUS FORCE
AN IDEAL IS THEIR LEADER AND THEIR KING
ASPIRING TO THE MONARCHY OF THE SUN
THEY CALL IN TRUTH FOR THEIR HIGH GOVERNMENT
HOLD HER INCARNATE IN THEIR DAILY ACTS
AND FILL THEIR THOUGHTS WITH HER INSPIRED VOICE
AND SHAPE THEIR LIVES INTO HER BREATHING FORM
TILL IN HER SUN-GOLD GODHEAD THEY TOO SHARE
OR TO THE TRUTH OF DARKNESS THEY SUBSCRIBE
WHETHER FOR HEAVEN OR HELL THEY MUST WAGE WAR
WARRIORS OF GOOD THEY SERVE A SHINING CAUSE
OR ARE EVIL'S SOLDIERS IN THE PAY OF SIN
FOR EVIL AND GOOD AN EQUAL TENURE KEEP
WHEREVER KNOWLEDGE IS IGNORANCE'S TWIN
ALL POWERS OF LIFE TOWARDS THEIR GODHEAD TEND
IN THE WIDENESS AND THE DARING OF THAT AIR
EACH BUILDS ITS TEMPLE AND EXPANDS ITS CULT
AND SIN TOO THERE IS A DIVINITY
AFFIRMING THE BEAUTY AND SPLENDOUR OF HER LAW
SHE CLAIMS LIFE AS HER NATURAL DOMAIN
ASSUMES THE WORLD'S THRONE OR DONS THE PAPAL ROBE
HER WORSHIPPERS PROCLAIM HER SACRED RIGHT
A RED-TIARAED FALSEHOOD THEY REVERE
WORSHIP THE SHADOW OF A CROOKED GOD
ADMIT THE BLACK IDEA THAT TWISTS THE BRAIN
OR LIE WITH THE HARLOT POWER THAT SLAYS THE SOUL
A MASTERING VIRTUE STATUESQUES THE POSE
OR A TITAN PASSION GOADS TO A PROUD UNREST
AT WISDOM'S ALTAR THEY ARE KINGS AND PRIESTS
OR THEIR LIFE A SACRIFICE TO AN IDOL OF POWER
OR BEAUTY SHINES ON THEM LIKE A WANDERING STAR
TOO FAR TO REACH PASSIONATE THEY FOLLOW HER LIGHT
IN ART AND LIFE THEY CATCH THE ALL-BEAUTIFUL'S RAY
AND MAKE THE WORLD THEIR RADIANT TREASURE HOUSE
EVEN COMMON FIGURES ARE WITH MARVEL ROBED
186
A CHARM AND GREATNESS LOCKED IN EVERY HOUR
AWAKES THE JOY WHICH SLEEPS IN ALL THINGS MADE
A MIGHTY VICTORY OR A MIGHTY FALL
A THRONE IN HEAVEN OR A PIT IN HELL
THE DUAL ENERGY THEY HAVE JUSTIFIED
AND MARKED THEIR SOULS WITH HER TREMENDOUS SEAL
WHATEVER FATE MAY DO TO THEM THEY HAVE EARNED
SOMETHING THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING THEY HAVE BEEN THEY LIVE
THERE MATTER IS SOUL'S RESULT AND NOT ITS CAUSE
IN A CONTRARY BALANCE TO EARTH'S TRUTH OF THINGS
THE GROSS WEIGHS LESS THE SUBTLE COUNTS FOR MORE
ON INNER VALUES HANGS THE OUTER PLAN
AS QUIVERS WITH THE THOUGHT THE EXPRESSIVE WORD
AS YEARNS THE ACT WITH THE PASSION OF THE SOUL
THIS WORLD'S APPARENT SENSIBLE DESIGN
LOOKS VIBRANT BACK TO SOME INTERIOR MIGHT
A MIND NOT LIMITED BY EXTERNAL SENSE
GAVE FIGURES TO THE SPIRIT'S IMPONDERABLES
THE WORLD'S IMPACTS WITHOUT CHANNELS REGISTERED
AND TURNED INTO THE BODY'S CONCRETE THRILL
THE VIVID WORKINGS OF A BODILESS FORCE
POWERS HERE SUBLIMINAL THAT ACT UNSEEN
OR IN AMBUSH CROUCH WAITING BEHIND THE WALL
CAME OUT IN FRONT UNCOVERING THEIR FACE
THE OCCULT GREW THERE OVERT THE OBVIOUS KEPT
A COVERT TURN AND SHOULDERED THE UNKNOWN
THE UNSEEN WAS FELT AND JOSTLED VISIBLE SHAPES
IN THE COMMUNION OF TWO MEETING MINDS
THOUGHT LOOKED AT THOUGHT AND HAD NO NEED OF SPEECH
EMOTION CLASPED EMOTION IN TWO HEARTS
THEY FELT EACH OTHER'S THRILL IN THE FLESH AND NERVES
OR MELTED EACH IN EACH AND GREW IMMENSE
AS WHEN TWO HOUSES BURN AND FIRE JOINS FIRE
HATE GRAPPLED HATE AND LOVE BROKE IN ON LOVE
WILL WRESTLED WITH WILL ON MIND'S INVISIBLE GROUND
OTHERS' SENSATIONS PASSING THROUGH LIKE WAVES
187
LEFT QUIVERING THE SUBTLE BODY'S FRAME
THEIR ANGER RUSHED GALLOPING IN BRUTE ATTACK
A CHARGE OF TRAMPLING HOOVES ON SHAKEN SOIL
ONE FELT ANOTHER'S GRIEF INVADE THE BREAST
ANOTHER'S JOY EXULTING RAN THROUGH THE BLOOD
HEARTS COULD DRAW CLOSE THROUGH DISTANCE VOICES NEAR
THAT SPOKE UPON THE SHORE OF ALIEN SEAS
THERE BEAT A THROB OF LIVING INTERCHANGE
BEING FELT BEING EVEN WHEN AFAR
AND CONSCIOUSNESS REPLIED TO CONSCIOUSNESS
AND YET THE ULTIMATE ONENESS WAS NOT THERE
THERE WAS A SEPARATENESS OF SOUL FROM SOUL
AN INNER WALL OF SILENCE COULD BE BUILT
AN ARMOUR OF CONSCIOUS MIGHT PROTECT AND SHIELD
THE BEING COULD BE CLOSED IN AND SOLITARY
ONE COULD REMAIN APART IN SELF ALONE
IDENTITY WAS NOT YET NOR UNION'S PEACE
ALL WAS IMPERFECT STILL HALF-KNOWN HALF-DONE
THE MIRACLE OF INCONSCIENCE OVERPASSED
THE MIRACLE OF THE SUPERCONSCIENT STILL
UNKNOWN SELF-WRAPPED UNFELT UNKNOWABLE
LOOKED DOWN ON THEM ORIGIN OF ALL THEY WERE
AS FORMS THEY CAME OF THE FORMLESS INFINITE
AS NAMES LIVED OF A NAMELESS ETERNITY
THE BEGINNING AND THE END WERE THERE OCCULT
A MIDDLE TERM WORKED UNEXPLAINED ABRUPT
THEY WERE WORDS THAT SPOKE TO A VAST WORDLESS TRUTH
THEY WERE FIGURES CROWDING AN UNFINISHED SUM
NONE TRULY KNEW HIMSELF OR KNEW THE WORLD
OR THE REALITY LIVING THERE ENSHRINED
ONLY THEY KNEW WHAT MIND COULD TAKE AND BUILD
OUT OF THE SECRET SUPERMIND'S HUGE STORE
A DARKNESS UNDER THEM A BRIGHT VOID ABOVE
UNCERTAIN THEY LIVED IN A GREAT CLIMBING SPACE
BY MYSTERIES THEY EXPLAINED A MYSTERY
A RIDDLING ANSWER MET THE RIDDLE OF THINGS
188
AS HE MOVED IN THIS ETHER OF AMBIGUOUS LIFE
HIMSELF WAS SOON A RIDDLE TO HIMSELF
AS SYMBOLS HE SAW ALL AND SOUGHT THEIR SENSE
ACROSS THE LEAPING SPRINGS OF DEATH AND BIRTH
AND OVER SHIFTING BORDERS OF SOUL-CHANGE
A HUNTER ON THE SPIRIT'S CREATIVE TRACK
HE FOLLOWED IN LIFE'S FINE AND MIGHTY TRAILS
PURSUING HER SEALED FORMIDABLE DELIGHT
IN A PERILOUS ADVENTURE WITHOUT CLOSE
AT FIRST NO AIM APPEARED IN THOSE LARGE STEPS
ONLY THE WIDE SOURCE HE SAW OF ALL THINGS HERE
LOOKING TOWARDS A WIDER SOURCE BEYOND
FOR AS SHE DREW AWAY FROM EARTHLY LINES
A TENSER DRAG WAS FELT FROM THE UNKNOWN
A HIGHER CONTEXT OF DELIVERING THOUGHT
DROVE HER TOWARDS MARVEL AND DISCOVERY
THERE CAME A HIGH RELEASE FROM PETTIER CARES
A MIGHTIER IMAGE OF DESIRE AND HOPE
A VASTER FORMULA A GREATER SCENE
EVER SHE CIRCLED TOWARDS SOME FAR-OFF LIGHT
HER SIGNS STILL COVERED MORE THAN THEY REVEALED
BUT TIED TO SOME IMMEDIATE SIGHT AND WILL
THEY LOST THEIR PURPORT IN THE JOY OF USE
TILL STRIPPED OF THEIR INFINITE MEANING THEY BECAME
A CIPHER GLEAMING WITH UNREAL SENSE
ARMED WITH A MAGICAL AND HAUNTED BOW
SHE AIMED AT A TARGET KEPT INVISIBLE
AND EVER DEEMED REMOTE THOUGH ALWAYS NEAR
AS ONE WHO SPELLS ILLUMINED CHARACTERS
THE KEY-BOOK OF A CRABBED MAGICIAN TEXT
HE SCANNED HER SUBTLE TANGLED WEIRD DESIGNS
AND THE SCREENED DIFFICULT THEOREM OF HER CLUES
TRACED IN THE MONSTROUS SANDS OF DESERT TIME
THE THREAD BEGINNINGS OF HER TITAN WORKS
WATCHED HER CHARADE OF ACTION FOR SOME HINT
189
READ THE NO-GESTURES OF HER SILHOUETTES
AND STROVE TO CAPTURE IN THEIR BURDENED DRIFT
THE DANCE-FANTASIA OF HER SEQUENCES
ESCAPING INTO RHYTHMIC MYSTERY
A GLIMMER OF FUGITIVE FEET ON FLEEING SOIL
IN THE LABYRINTH PATTERN OF HER THOUGHTS AND HOPES
AND THE BYWAYS OF HER INTIMATE DESIRES
IN THE COMPLEX CORNERS CROWDED WITH HER DREAMS
AND ROUNDS CROSSED BY AN INTRIGUE OF IRRELEVANT ROUNDS
A WANDERER STRAYING AMID FUGITIVE SCENES
HE LOST ITS SIGNS AND CHASED EACH FAILING GUESS
EVER HE MET KEY-WORDS IGNORANT OF THEIR KEY
A SUN THAT DAZZLED ITS OWN EYE OF SIGHT
A LUMINOUS ENIGMA'S BRILLIANT HOOD
LIT THE DENSE PURPLE BARRIER OF THOUGHT'S SKY
A DIM LARGE TRANCE SHOWED TO THE NIGHT HER STARS
AS IF SITTING NEAR AN OPEN WINDOW'S GAP
HE READ BY LIGHTNING-FLASH ON CROWDING FLASH
CHAPTERS OF HER METAPHYSICAL ROMANCE
OF THE SOUL'S SEARCH FOR LOST REALITY
AND HER FICTIONS DRAWN FROM SPIRIT'S AUTHENTIC FACT
HER CAPRICES AND CONCEITS AND MEANINGS LOCKED
HER RASH UNSEIZABLE FREAKS AND MYSTERIED TURNS
THE MAGNIFICENT WRAPPINGS OF HER SECRECY
THAT FOLD HER DESIRABLE BODY OUT OF SIGHT
THE STRANGE SIGNIFICANT FORMS WOVEN ON HER ROBE
HER MEANINGFUL OUTLINES OF THE SOULS OF THINGS
HE SAW HER FALSE TRANSPARENCIES OF THOUGHT-HUE
HER RICH BROCADES WITH IMAGED FANCIES SEWN
AND MUTABLE MASKS AND BROIDERIES OF DISGUISE
A THOUSAND BAFFLING FACES OF THE TRUTH
LOOKED AT HIM FROM HER FORMS WITH UNKNOWN EYES
AND WORDLESS MOUTHS UNRECOGNISABLE
SPOKE FROM THE FIGURES OF HER MASQUERADE
OR PEERED FROM THE RECONDITE MAGNIFICENCE
AND SUBTLE SPLENDOUR OF HER DRAPERIES
190
IN SUDDEN SCINTILLATIONS OF THE UNKNOWN
INEXPRESSIVE SOUNDS BECAME VERIDICAL
IDEAS THAT SEEMED UNMEANING FLASHED OUT TRUTH
VOICES THAT CAME FROM UNSEEN WAITING WORLDS
UTTERED THE SYLLABLES OF THE UNMANIFEST
TO CLOTHE THE BODY OF THE MYSTIC WORD
AND WIZARD DIAGRAMS OF THE OCCULT LAW
SEALED SOME PRECISE UNREADABLE HARMONY
OR USED HUE AND FIGURE TO RECONSTITUTE
THE HERALD BLAZON OF TIME'S SECRET THINGS
IN HER GREEN WILDERNESSES AND LURKING DEPTHS
IN HER THICKETS OF JOY WHERE DANGER CLASPS DELIGHT
HE GLIMPSED THE HIDDEN WINGS OF HER SONGSTER HOPES
A GLIMMER OF BLUE AND GOLD AND SCARLET FIRE
IN HER COVERT LANES BORDERING HER CHANCE FIELD-PATHS
AND BY HER SINGING RIVULETS AND CALM LAKES
HE FOUND THE GLOW OF HER GOLDEN FRUITS OF BLISS
AND THE BEAUTY OF HER FLOWERS OF DREAM AND MUSE
AS IF A MIRACLE OF HEART'S CHANGE BY JOY
HE WATCHED IN THE ALCHEMIST RADIANCE OF HER SUNS
THE CRIMSON OUTBURST OF ONE SECULAR FLOWER
ON THE TREE-OF-SACRIFICE OF SPIRITUAL LOVE
IN THE SLEEPY SPLENDOUR OF HER NOONS HE SAW
A PERPETUAL REPETITION THROUGH THE HOURS
THOUGHT'S DANCE OF DRAGONFLIES ON MYSTERY'S STREAM
THAT SKIM BUT NEVER TEST ITS MURMURS' RACE
AND HEARD THE LAUGHTER OF HER ROSE DESIRES
RUNNING AS IF TO ESCAPE FROM LONGED-FOR HANDS
JINGLING SWEET ANKLET-BELLS OF FANTASY
AMIDST LIVE SYMBOLS OF HER OCCULT POWER
HE MOVED AND FELT THEM AS CLOSE REAL FORMS
IN THAT LIFE MORE CONCRETE THAN THE LIVES OF MEN
THROBBED HEART-BEATS OF THE HIDDEN REALITY
EMBODIED WAS THERE WHAT WE BUT THINK AND FEEL
SELF-FRAMED WHAT HERE TAKES OUTWARD BORROWED SHAPES
A COMRADE OF SILENCE ON HER AUSTERE HEIGHTS
191
ACCEPTED BY HER MIGHTY LONELINESS
HE STOOD WITH HER ON MEDITATING PEAKS
WHERE LIFE AND BEING ARE A SACRAMENT
OFFERED TO THE REALITY BEYOND
AND SAW HER LOOSE INTO INFINITY
HER HOODED EAGLES OF SIGNIFICANCE
MESSENGERS OF THOUGHT TO THE UNKNOWABLE
IDENTIFIED IN SOUL-VISION AND SOUL-SENSE
ENTERING INTO HER DEPTHS AS INTO A HOUSE
ALL HE BECAME THAT SHE WAS OR LONGED TO BE
HE THOUGHT WITH HER THOUGHTS AND JOURNEYED WITH HER STEPS
LIVED WITH HER BREATH AND SCANNED ALL WITH HER EYES
THAT SO HE MIGHT LEARN THE SECRET OF HER SOUL
A WITNESS OVERMASTERED BY HIS SCENE
HE ADMIRED HER SPLENDID FRONT OF POMP AND PLAY
AND THE MARVELS OF HER RICH AND DELICATE CRAFT
AND THRILLED TO THE INSISTENCE OF HER CRY
IMPASSIONED HE BORE THE SORCERIES OF HER MIGHT
FELT LAID ON HIM HER ABRUPT MYSTERIOUS WILL
HER HANDS THAT KNEAD FATE IN THEIR VIOLENT GRASP
HER TOUCH THAT MOVES HER POWERS THAT SEIZE AND DRIVE
BUT THIS TOO HE SAW HER SOUL THAT WEPT WITHIN
HER SEEKINGS VAIN THAT CLUTCH AT FLEEING TRUTH
HER HOPES WHOSE SOMBRE GAZE MATES WITH DESPAIR
THE PASSION THAT POSSESSED HER LONGING LIMBS
THE TROUBLE AND RAPTURE OF HER YEARNING BREASTS
HER MIND THAT TOILS UNSATISFIED WITH ITS FRUITS
HER HEART THAT CAPTURES NOT THE ONE BELOVED
ALWAYS HE MET A VEILED AND SEEKING FORCE
AN EXILED GODDESS BUILDING MIMIC HEAVENS
A SPHINX WHOSE EYES LOOK UP TO A HIDDEN SUN
EVER HE FELT NEAR A SPIRIT IN HER FORMS
ITS PASSIVE PRESENCE WAS HER NATURE'S STRENGTH
THIS SOLE IS REAL IN APPARENT THINGS
EVEN UPON EARTH THE SPIRIT IS LIFE'S KEY
192
BUT HER SOLID OUTSIDES NOWHERE BEAR ITS TRACE
ITS STAMP ON HER ACTS IS UNDISCOVERABLE
A PATHOS OF LOST HEIGHTS IS ITS APPEAL
ONLY SOMETIMES IS CAUGHT A SHADOWY LINE
THAT SEEMS A HINT OF VEILED REALITY
LIFE STARED AT HIM WITH VAGUE CONFUSED OUTLINES
OFFERING A PICTURE THE EYES COULD NOT KEEP
A STORY THAT WAS YET NOT WRITTEN THERE
AS IN A FRAGMENTARY HALF-LOST DESIGN
LIFE'S MEANINGS FLED FROM THE PURSUING EYE
LIFE'S VISAGE HIDES LIFE'S REAL SELF FROM SIGHT
LIFE'S SECRET SENSE IS WRITTEN WITHIN ABOVE
THE THOUGHT THAT GIVES IT SENSE LIVES FAR BEYOND
IT IS NOT SEEN IN ITS HALF-FINISHED DESIGN
IN VAIN WE HOPE TO READ THE BAFFLING SIGNS
OR FIND THE WORD OF THE HALF-PLAYED CHARADE
ONLY IN THAT GREATER LIFE A CRYPTIC THOUGHT
IS FOUND IS HINTED SOME INTERPRETING WORD
THAT MAKES THE EARTH-MYTH A TALE INTELLIGIBLE
SOMETHING WAS SEEN AT LAST THAT LOOKED LIKE TRUTH
IN A HALF-LIT AIR OF HAZARDOUS MYSTERY
THE EYE THAT LOOKS AT THE DARK HALF OF TRUTH
MADE OUT AN IMAGE MID A VIVID BLUR
AND PEERING THROUGH A MIST OF SUBTLE TINTS
HE SAW A HALF-BLIND CHAINED DIVINITY
BEWILDERED BY THE WORLD IN WHICH HE MOVED
YET CONSCIOUS OF SOME LIGHT PROMPTING HIS SOUL
ATTRACTED TO STRANGE FAR-OFF SHIMMERINGS
LED BY THE FLUTING OF A DISTANT PLAYER
HE SOUGHT HIS WAY AMID LIFE'S LAUGHTER AND CALL
AND THE INDEX CHAOS OF HER MYRIAD STEPS
TOWARDS SOME TOTAL DEEP INFINITUDE
AROUND CROWDED THE FOREST OF HER SIGNS
AT HAZARD HE READ BY ARROW-LEAPS OF THOUGHT
THAT HIT THE MARK BY GUESS OR LUMINOUS CHANCE
HER CHANGING COLOURED ROAD-LIGHTS OF IDEA
193
AND HER SIGNALS OF UNCERTAIN SWIFT EVENT
THE HIEROGLYPHS OF HER SYMBOL PAGEANTRIES
AND HER LANDMARKS IN THE TANGLED PATHS OF TIME
IN HER MAZES OF APPROACH AND OF RETREAT
TO EVERY SIDE SHE DRAWS HIM AND REPELS
BUT DRAWN TOO NEAR ESCAPES FROM HIS EMBRACE
ALL WAYS SHE LEADS HIM BUT NO WAY IS SURE
ALLURED BY THE MANY-TONED MARVEL OF HER CHANT
ATTRACTED BY THE WITCHCRAFT OF HER MOODS
AND MOVED BY HER CASUAL TOUCH TO JOY AND GRIEF
HE LOSES HIMSELF IN HER BUT WINS HER NOT
A FUGITIVE PARADISE SMILES AT HIM FROM HER EYES
HE DREAMS OF HER BEAUTY MADE FOR EVER HIS
HE DREAMS OF HIS MASTERY HER LIMBS SHALL BEAR
HE DREAMS OF THE MAGIC OF HER BREASTS OF BLISS
IN HER ILLUMINED SCRIPT HER FANCIFUL
TRANSLATION OF GOD'S PURE ORIGINAL TEXT
HE THINKS TO READ THE SCRIPTURE WONDERFUL
HIERATIC KEY TO UNKNOWN BEATITUDES
BUT THE WORD OF LIFE IS HIDDEN IN ITS SCRIPT
THE CHANT OF LIFE HAS LOST ITS DIVINE NOTE
UNSEEN A CAPTIVE IN A HOUSE OF SOUND
THE SPIRIT LOST IN THE SPLENDOUR OF A DREAM
LISTENS TO A THOUSAND-VOICED ILLUSION'S ODE
A DELICATE WEFT OF SORCERY STEALS THE HEART
OR A FIERY MAGIC TINTS HER TONES AND HUES
YET THEY BUT WAKE A THRILL OF TRANSIENT GRACE
A VAGRANT MARCH STRUCK BY THE WANDERER TIME
THEY CALL TO A BRIEF UNSATISFIED DELIGHT
OR WALLOW IN RAVISHMENTS OF MIND AND SENSE
BUT MISS THE LUMINOUS ANSWER OF THE SOUL
A BLIND HEART-THROB THAT REACHES JOY THROUGH TEARS
A YEARNING TOWARDS PEAKS FOR EVER UNREACHED
AN ECSTASY OF UNFULFILLED DESIRE
TRACK THE LAST HEAVENWARD CLIMBINGS OF HER VOICE
TRANSMUTED ARE PAST SUFFERING'S MEMORIES
194
INTO AN OLD SADNESS'S SWEET ESCAPING TRAIL
TURNED ARE HER TEARS TO GEMS OF DIAMOND PAIN
HER SORROW INTO A MAGIC CROWN OF SONG
BRIEF ARE HER SNATCHES OF FELICITY
THAT TOUCH THE SURFACE THEN ESCAPE OR DIE
A LOST REMEMBRANCE ECHOES IN HER DEPTHS
A DEATHLESS LONGING IS HERS A VEILED SELF'S CALL
A PRISONER IN THE MORTAL'S LIMITING WORLD
A SPIRIT WOUNDED BY LIFE SOBS IN HER BREAST
A CHERISHED SUFFERING IS HER DEEPEST CRY
A WANDERER ON FORLORN DESPAIRING ROUTES
ALONG THE ROADS OF SOUND A FRUSTRATE VOICE
FORSAKEN CRIES TO A FORGOTTEN BLISS
ASTRAY IN THE ECHO CAVERNS OF DESIRE
IT GUARDS THE PHANTOMS OF A SOUL'S DEAD HOPES
AND KEEPS ALIVE THE VOICE OF PERISHED THINGS
OR LINGERS UPON SWEET AND ERRANT NOTES
HUNTING FOR PLEASURE IN THE HEART OF PAIN
A FATEFUL HAND HAS TOUCHED THE COSMIC CHORDS
AND THE INTRUSION OF A TROUBLED STRAIN
COVERS THE INNER MUSIC'S HIDDEN KEY
THAT GUIDES UNHEARD THE SURFACE CADENCES
YET IS IT JOY TO LIVE AND TO CREATE
AND JOY TO LOVE AND LABOUR THOUGH ALL FAILS
AND JOY TO SEEK THOUGH ALL WE FIND DECEIVES
AND ALL ON WHICH WE LEAN BETRAYS OUR TRUST
YET SOMETHING IN ITS DEPTHS WAS WORTH THE PAIN
A PASSIONATE MEMORY HAUNTS WITH ECSTASY'S FIRE
EVEN GRIEF HAS JOY HIDDEN BENEATH ITS ROOTS
FOR NOTHING IS TRULY VAIN THE ONE HAS MADE
IN OUR DEFEATED HEARTS GOD'S STRENGTH SURVIVES
AND VICTORY'S STAR STILL LIGHTS OUR DESPERATE ROAD
OUR DEATH IS MADE A PASSAGE TO NEW WORLDS
THIS TO LIFE'S MUSIC GIVES ITS ANTHEM SWELL
TO ALL SHE LENDS THE GLORY OF HER VOICE
HEAVEN'S RAPTURES WHISPER TO HER HEART AND PASS
195
EARTH'S TRANSIENT YEARNINGS CRY FROM HER LIPS AND FADE
ALONE THE GOD-GIVEN HYMN ESCAPES HER ART
THAT CAME WITH HER FROM HER SPIRITUAL HOME
BUT STOPPED HALF-WAY AND FAILED A SILENT WORD
AWAKE IN SOME DEEP PAUSE OF WAITING WORLDS
A MURMUR SUSPENDED IN ETERNITY'S HUSH
BUT NO BREATH COMES FROM THE SUPERNAL PEACE
A SUMPTUOUS INTERLUDE OCCUPIES THE EAR
AND THE HEART LISTENS AND THE SOUL CONSENTS
AN EVANESCENT MUSIC IT REPEATS
WASTING ON TRANSIENCE TIME'S ETERNITY
A TREMOLO OF THE VOICES OF THE HOURS
OBLIVIOUS SCREENS THE HIGH INTENDED THEME
THE SELF-EMBODYING SPIRIT CAME TO PLAY
ON THE VAST CLAVICHORD OF NATURE-FORCE
ONLY A MIGHTY MURMUR HERE AND THERE
OF THE ETERNAL WORD THE BLISSFUL VOICE
OR BEAUTY'S TOUCH TRANSFIGURING HEART AND SENSE
A WANDERING SPLENDOUR AND A MYSTIC CRY
RECALLS THE STRENGTH AND SWEETNESS HEARD NO MORE
HERE IS THE GAP HERE STOPS OR SINKS LIFE'S FORCE
THIS DEFICIT PAUPERS THE MAGICIAN'S SKILL
THIS WANT MAKES ALL THE REST SEEM THIN AND BARE
A HALF-SIGHT DRAWS THE HORIZON OF HER ACTS
HER DEPTHS REMEMBER WHAT SHE CAME TO DO
BUT THE MIND HAS FORGOTTEN OR THE HEART MISTAKES
IN NATURE'S ENDLESS LINES IS LOST THE GOD
IN KNOWLEDGE TO SUM UP OMNISCIENCE
IN ACTION TO ERECT THE OMNIPOTENT
TO CREATE HER CREATOR HERE WAS HER HEART'S CONCEIT
TO INVADE THE COSMIC SCENE WITH UTTER GOD
TOILING TO TRANSFORM THE STILL FAR ABSOLUTE
INTO AN ALL-FULFILLING EPIPHANY
INTO AN UTTERANCE OF THE INEFFABLE
SHE WOULD BRING THE GLORY HERE OF THE ABSOLUTE'S FORCE
196
CHANGE POISE INTO CREATION'S RHYTHMIC SWING
MARRY WITH A SKY OF CALM A SEA OF BLISS
A FIRE TO CALL ETERNITY INTO TIME
MAKE BODY'S JOY AS VIVID AS THE SOUL'S
EARTH SHE WOULD LIFT TO NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH HEAVEN
LABOURS LIFE TO EQUATE WITH THE SUPREME
AND RECONCILE THE ETERNAL AND THE ABYSS
HER PRAGMATISM OF THE TRANSCENDENT TRUTH
FILLS SILENCE WITH THE VOICES OF THE GODS
BUT IN THE CRY THE SINGLE VOICE IS LOST
FOR NATURE'S VISION CLIMBS BEYOND HER ACTS
A LIFE OF GODS IN HEAVEN SHE SEES ABOVE
A DEMIGOD EMERGING FROM AN APE
IS ALL SHE CAN IN OUR MORTAL ELEMENT
HERE THE HALF-GOD THE HALF-TITAN ARE HER PEAK
THIS GREATER LIFE WAVERS TWIXT EARTH AND SKY
A POIGNANT PARADOX PURSUES HER DREAMS
HER HOODED ENERGY MOVES AN IGNORANT WORLD
TO LOOK FOR A JOY HER OWN STRONG CLASP PUTS OFF
IN HER EMBRACE IT CANNOT TURN TO ITS SOURCE
IMMENSE HER POWER ENDLESS HER ACT'S VAST DRIVE
ASTRAY IS ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND LOST
ALTHOUGH SHE CARRIES IN HER SECRET BREAST
THE LAW AND JOURNEYING CURVE OF ALL THINGS BORN
HER KNOWLEDGE PARTIAL SEEMS HER PURPOSE SMALL
ON A SOIL OF YEARNING TREAD HER SUMPTUOUS HOURS
A LEADEN NESCIENCE WEIGHS THE WINGS OF THOUGHT
HER POWER OPPRESSES THE BEING WITH ITS GARBS
HER ACTIONS PRISON ITS IMMORTAL GAZE
A SENSE OF LIMIT HAUNTS HER MASTERIES
AND NOWHERE IS ASSURED CONTENT OR PEACE
FOR ALL THE DEPTH AND BEAUTY OF HER WORK
A WISDOM LACKS THAT SETS THE SPIRIT FREE
AN OLD AND FADED CHARM HAD NOW HER FACE
AND PALLED FOR HIM HER QUICK AND CURIOUS LORE
HIS WIDE SOUL ASKED A DEEPER JOY THAN HERS
197
OUT OF HER DAEDAL LINES HE SOUGHT ESCAPE
BUT NEITHER GATE OF HORN NOR IVORY
HE FOUND NOR POSTERN OF SPIRITUAL SIGHT
THERE WAS NO ISSUE FROM THAT DREAMLIKE SPACE
OUR BEING MUST MOVE ETERNALLY THROUGH TIME
DEATH HELPS US NOT VAIN IS THE HOPE TO CEASE
A SECRET WILL COMPELS US TO ENDURE
OUR LIFE'S REPOSE IS IN THE INFINITE
IT CANNOT END ITS END IS LIFE SUPREME
DEATH IS A PASSAGE NOT THE GOAL OF OUR WALK
SOME ANCIENT DEEP IMPULSION LABOURS ON
OUR SOULS ARE DRAGGED AS WITH A HIDDEN LEASH
CARRIED FROM BIRTH TO BIRTH FROM WORLD TO WORLD
OUR ACTS PROLONG AFTER THE BODY'S FALL
THE OLD PERPETUAL JOURNEY WITHOUT PAUSE
NO SILENT PEAK IS FOUND WHERE TIME CAN REST
THIS WAS A MAGIC STREAM THAT REACHED NO SEA
HOWEVER FAR HE WENT WHEREVER TURNED
THE WHEEL OF WORKS RAN WITH HIM AND OUTSTRIPPED
ALWAYS A FARTHER TASK WAS LEFT TO DO
A BEAT OF ACTION AND A CRY OF SEARCH
FOR EVER GREW IN THAT UNQUIET WORLD
A BUSY MURMUR FILLED THE HEART OF TIME
ALL WAS CONTRIVANCE AND UNCEASING STIR
A HUNDRED WAYS TO LIVE WERE TRIED IN VAIN
A SAMENESS THAT ASSUMED A THOUSAND FORMS
STROVE TO ESCAPE FROM ITS LONG MONOTONE
AND MADE NEW THINGS THAT SOON WERE LIKE THE OLD
A CURIOUS DECORATION LURED THE EYE
AND NOVEL VALUES FURBISHED ANCIENT THEMES
TO CHEAT THE MIND WITH THE IDEA OF CHANGE
A DIFFERENT PICTURE THAT WAS STILL THE SAME
APPEARED UPON THE COSMIC VAGUE BACKGROUND
ONLY ANOTHER LABYRINTHINE HOUSE
OF CREATURES AND THEIR DOINGS AND EVENTS
A CITY OF THE TRAFFIC OF BOUND SOULS
198
A MARKET OF CREATION AND HER WARES
WAS OFFERED TO THE LABOURING MIND AND HEART
A CIRCUIT ENDING WHERE IT FIRST BEGAN
IS DUBBED THE FORWARD AND ETERNAL MARCH
OF PROGRESS ON PERFECTION'S UNKNOWN ROAD
EACH FINAL SCHEME LEADS TO A SEQUEL PLAN
YET EVERY NEW DEPARTURE SEEMS THE LAST
INSPIRED EVANGEL THEORY'S ULTIMATE PEAK
PROCLAIMING A PANACEA FOR ALL TIME'S ILLS
OR CARRYING THOUGHT IN ITS ULTIMATE ZENITH FLIGHT
AND TRUMPETING SUPREME DISCOVERY
EACH BRIEF IDEA A STRUCTURE PERISHABLE
PUBLISHES THE IMMORTALITY OF ITS RULE
ITS CLAIM TO BE THE PERFECT FORM OF THINGS
TRUTH'S LAST EPITOME TIME'S GOLDEN BEST
BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN ACHIEVED OF INFINITE WORTH
A WORLD MADE EVER ANEW NEVER COMPLETE
PILED ALWAYS HALF-ATTEMPTS ON LOST ATTEMPTS
AND SAW A FRAGMENT AS THE ETERNAL WHOLE
IN THE AIMLESS MOUNTING TOTAL OF THINGS DONE
EXISTENCE SEEMED A VAIN NECESSITY'S ACT
A WRESTLE OF ETERNAL OPPOSITES
IN A CLASPED ANTAGONISM'S CLOSE-LOCKED EMBRACE
A PLAY WITHOUT DENOUEMENT OR IDEA
A HUNGER MARCH OF LIVES WITHOUT A GOAL
OR WRITTEN ON A BARE BLACKBOARD OF SPACE
A FUTILE AND RECURRING SUM OF SOULS
A HOPE THAT FAILED A LIGHT THAT NEVER SHONE
THE LABOUR OF AN UNACCOMPLISHED FORCE
TIED TO ITS ACTS IN A DIM ETERNITY
THERE IS NO END OR NONE CAN YET BE SEEN
ALTHOUGH DEFEATED LIFE MUST STRUGGLE ON
ALWAYS SHE SEES A CROWN SHE CANNOT GRASP
HER EYES ARE FIXED BEYOND HER FALLEN STATE
THERE QUIVERS STILL WITHIN HER BREAST AND OURS
A GLORY THAT WAS ONCE AND IS NO MORE
199
OR THERE CALLS TO US FROM SOME UNFULFILLED BEYOND
A GREATNESS YET UNREACHED BY THE HALTING WORLD
IN A MEMORY BEHIND OUR MORTAL SENSE
A DREAM PERSISTS OF LARGER HAPPIER AIR
BREATHING AROUND FREE HEARTS OF JOY AND LOVE
FORGOTTEN BY US IMMORTAL IN LOST TIME
A GHOST OF BLISS PURSUES HER HAUNTED DEPTHS
FOR SHE REMEMBERS STILL THOUGH NOW SO FAR
HER REALM OF GOLDEN EASE AND GLAD DESIRE
AND THE BEAUTY AND STRENGTH AND HAPPINESS THAT WERE HERS
IN THE SWEETNESS OF HER GLOWING PARADISE
IN HER KINGDOM OF IMMORTAL ECSTASY
HALF-WAY BETWEEN GOD'S SILENCE AND THE ABYSS
THIS KNOWLEDGE IN OUR HIDDEN PARTS WE KEEP
AWAKE TO A VAGUE MYSTERY'S APPEAL
WE MEET A DEEP UNSEEN REALITY
FAR TRUER THAN THE WORLD'S FACE OF PRESENT TRUTH
WE ARE CHASED BY A SELF WE CANNOT NOW RECALL
AND MOVED BY A SPIRIT WE MUST STILL BECOME
AS ONE WHO HAS LOST THE KINGDOM OF HIS SOUL
WE LOOK BACK TO SOME GOD-PHASE OF OUR BIRTH
OTHER THAN THIS IMPERFECT CREATURE HERE
AND HOPE IN THIS OR A DIVINER WORLD
TO RECOVER YET FROM HEAVEN'S PATIENT GUARD
WHAT BY OUR MIND'S FORGETFULNESS WE MISS
OUR BEING'S NATURAL FELICITY
OUR HEART'S DELIGHT WE HAVE EXCHANGED FOR GRIEF
THE BODY'S THRILL WE BARTERED FOR MERE PAIN
THE BLISS FOR WHICH OUR MORTAL NATURE YEARNS
AS YEARNS AN OBSCURE MOTH TO BLAZING LIGHT
OUR LIFE IS A MARCH TO A VICTORY NEVER WON
THIS WAVE OF BEING LONGING FOR DELIGHT
THIS EAGER TURMOIL OF UNSATISFIED STRENGTHS
THESE LONG FAR FILES OF FORWARD-STRIVING HOPES
LIFT WORSHIPPING EYES TO THE BLUE VOID CALLED HEAVEN
LOOKING FOR THE GOLDEN HAND THAT NEVER CAME
200
THE ADVENT FOR WHICH ALL CREATION WAITS
THE BEAUTIFUL VISAGE OF ETERNITY
THAT SHALL APPEAR UPON THE ROADS OF TIME
YET STILL TO OURSELVES WE SAY REKINDLING FAITH
OH SURELY ONE DAY HE SHALL COME TO OUR CRY
ONE DAY HE SHALL CREATE OUR LIFE ANEW
AND UTTER THE MAGIC FORMULA OF PEACE
AND BRING PERFECTION TO THE SCHEME OF THINGS
ONE DAY HE SHALL DESCEND TO LIFE AND EARTH
LEAVING THE SECRECY OF THE ETERNAL DOORS
INTO A WORLD THAT CRIES TO HIM FOR HELP
AND BRING THE TRUTH THAT SETS THE SPIRIT FREE
THE JOY THAT IS THE BAPTISM OF THE SOUL
THE STRENGTH THAT IS THE OUTSTRETCHED ARM OF LOVE
ONE DAY HE SHALL LIFT HIS BEAUTY'S DREADFUL VEIL
IMPOSE DELIGHT ON THE WORLD'S BEATING HEART
AND BARE HIS SECRET BODY OF LIGHT AND BLISS
BUT NOW WE STRAIN TO REACH AN UNKNOWN GOAL
THERE IS NO END OF SEEKING AND OF BIRTH
THERE IS NO END OF DYING AND RETURN
THE LIFE THAT WINS ITS AIM ASKS GREATER AIMS
THE LIFE THAT FAILS AND DIES MUST LIVE AGAIN
TILL IT HAS FOUND ITSELF IT CANNOT CEASE
ALL MUST BE DONE FOR WHICH LIFE AND DEATH WERE MADE
BUT WHO SHALL SAY THAT EVEN THEN IS REST
OR THERE REPOSE AND ACTION ARE THE SAME
IN THE DEEP BREAST OF GOD'S SUPREME DELIGHT
IN A HIGH STATE WHERE IGNORANCE IS NO MORE
EACH MOVEMENT IS A WAVE OF PEACE AND BLISS
REPOSE GOD'S MOTIONLESS CREATIVE FORCE
ACTION A RIPPLE IN THE INFINITE
AND BIRTH A GESTURE OF ETERNITY
A SUN OF TRANSFIGURATION STILL CAN SHINE
AND NIGHT CAN BARE ITS CORE OF MYSTIC LIGHT
THE SELF-CANCELLING SELF-AFFLICTING PARADOX
INTO A SELF-LUMINOUS MYSTERY MIGHT CHANGE
201
THE IMBROGLIO INTO A JOYFUL MIRACLE
THEN GOD COULD BE VISIBLE HERE HERE TAKE A SHAPE
DISCLOSED WOULD BE THE SPIRIT'S IDENTITY
LIFE WOULD REVEAL HER TRUE IMMORTAL FACE
BUT NOW A TERMLESS LABOUR IS HER FATE
IN ITS RECURRENT DECIMAL OF EVENTS
BIRTH DEATH ARE A CEASELESS ITERATION'S POINTS
THE OLD QUESTION-MARK MARGINS EACH FINISHED PAGE
EACH VOLUME OF HER EFFORT'S HISTORY
A LIMPING YES THROUGH THE AEONS JOURNEYS STILL
ACCOMPANIED BY AN ETERNAL NO
ALL SEEMS IN VAIN YET ENDLESS IS THE GAME
IMPASSIVE TURNS THE EVER-CIRCLING WHEEL
LIFE HAS NO ISSUE DEATH BRINGS NO RELEASE
A PRISONER OF ITSELF THE BEING LIVES
AND KEEPS ITS FUTILE IMMORTALITY
EXTINCTION IS DENIED ITS SOLE ESCAPE
AN ERROR OF THE GODS HAS MADE THE WORLD
OR INDIFFERENT THE ETERNAL WATCHES TIME
202
A MIND ABSOLVED FROM LIFE MADE CALM TO KNOW
A HEART DIVORCED FROM THE BLINDNESS AND THE PANG
THE SEAL OF TEARS THE BOND OF IGNORANCE
HE TURNED TO FIND THAT WIDE WORLD-FAILURE'S CAUSE
AWAY HE LOOKED FROM NATURE'S VISIBLE FACE
AND SENT HIS GAZE INTO THE VIEWLESS VAST
THE FORMIDABLE UNKNOWN INFINITY
ASLEEP BEHIND THE ENDLESS COIL OF THINGS
THAT CARRIES THE UNIVERSE IN ITS TIMELESS BREADTHS
AND THE RIPPLES OF ITS BEING ARE OUR LIVES
THE WORLDS ARE BUILT BY ITS UNCONSCIOUS BREATH
AND MATTER AND MIND ARE ITS FIGURES OR ITS POWERS
OUR WAKING THOUGHTS THE OUTPUT OF ITS DREAMS
THE VEIL WAS RENT THAT COVERS NATURE'S DEPTHS
HE SAW THE FOUNT OF THE WORLD'S LASTING PAIN
AND THE MOUTH OF THE BLACK PIT OF IGNORANCE
THE EVIL GUARDED AT THE ROOTS OF LIFE
RAISED UP ITS HEAD AND LOOKED INTO HIS EYES
ON A DIM BANK WHERE DIES SUBJECTIVE SPACE
FROM A STARK RIDGE OVERLOOKING ALL THAT IS
A TENEBROUS AWAKENED NESCIENCE
HER WIDE BLANK EYES WONDERING AT TIME AND FORM
STARED AT THE INVENTIONS OF THE LIVING VOID
AND THE ABYSS WHENCE OUR BEGINNINGS ROSE
BEHIND APPEARED A GREY CARVED MASK OF NIGHT
WATCHING THE BIRTH OF ALL CREATED THINGS
A HIDDEN PUISSANCE CONSCIOUS OF ITS FORCE
A VAGUE AND LURKING PRESENCE EVERYWHERE
A CONTRARY DOOM THAT THREATENS ALL THINGS MADE
A DEATH FIGURING AS THE DARK SEED OF LIFE
SEEMED TO ENGENDER AND TO SLAY THE WORLD
203
THEN FROM THE SOMBRE MYSTERY OF THE GULFS
AND FROM THE HOLLOW BOSOM OF THE MASK
SOMETHING CREPT FORTH THAT SEEMED A SHAPELESS THOUGHT
A FATAL INFLUENCE UPON CREATURES STOLE
WHOSE LETHAL TOUCH PURSUED THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT
ON LIFE WAS LAID THE HAUNTING FINGER OF DEATH
AND OVERCAST WITH ERROR GRIEF AND PAIN
THE SOUL'S NATIVE WILL FOR TRUTH AND JOY AND LIGHT
A DEFORMATION COILED THAT CLAIMED TO BE
THE BEING'S VERY TURN NATURE'S TRUE DRIVE
A HOSTILE AND PERVERTING MIND AT WORK
IN EVERY CORNER ENSCONCED OF CONSCIOUS LIFE
CORRUPTED TRUTH WITH HER OWN FORMULAS
INTERCEPTOR OF THE LISTENING OF THE SOUL
AFFLICTING KNOWLEDGE WITH THE HUE OF DOUBT
IT CAPTURED THE ORACLES OF THE OCCULT GODS
EFFACED THE SIGNPOSTS OF LIFE'S PILGRIMAGE
CANCELLED THE FIRM ROCK-EDICTS GRAVED BY TIME
AND ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE COSMIC LAW
ERECTED ITS BRONZE PYLONS OF MISRULE
EVEN LIGHT AND LOVE BY THAT CLOAKED DANGER'S SPELL
TURNED FROM THE BRILLIANT NATURE OF THE GODS
TO FALLEN ANGELS AND MISLEADING SUNS
BECAME THEMSELVES A DANGER AND A CHARM
A PERVERSE SWEETNESS HEAVEN-BORN MALEFICE
ITS POWER COULD DEFORM DIVINEST THINGS
A WIND OF SORROW BREATHED UPON THE WORLD
ALL THOUGHT WITH FALSEHOOD WAS BESIEGED ALL ACT
STAMPED WITH DEFECT OR WITH FRUSTRATION'S SIGN
ALL HIGH ATTEMPT WITH FAILURE OR VAIN SUCCESS
BUT NONE COULD KNOW THE REASON OF HIS FALL
THE GREY MASK WHISPERED AND THOUGH NO SOUND WAS HEARD
YET IN THE IGNORANT HEART A SEED WAS SOWN
THAT BORE BLACK FRUIT OF SUFFERING DEATH AND BALE
OUT OF THE CHILL STEPPES OF A BLEAK UNSEEN
INVISIBLE WEARING THE NIGHT'S GREY MASK
204
ARRIVED THE SHADOWY DREADFUL MESSENGERS
INVADERS FROM A DANGEROUS WORLD OF POWER
AMBASSADORS OF EVIL'S ABSOLUTE
IN SILENCE THE INAUDIBLE VOICES SPOKE
HANDS THAT NONE SAW PLANTED THE FATAL GRAIN
NO FORM WAS SEEN YET A DIRE WORK WAS DONE
AN IRON DECREE IN CROOKED UNCIALS WRITTEN
IMPOSED A LAW OF SIN AND ADVERSE FATE
LIFE LOOKED AT HIM WITH CHANGED AND SOMBRE EYES
HER BEAUTY HE SAW AND THE YEARNING HEART IN THINGS
THAT WITH A LITTLE HAPPINESS IS CONTENT
ANSWERING TO A SMALL RAY OF TRUTH OR LOVE
HE SAW HER GOLD SUNLIGHT AND HER FAR BLUE SKY
HER GREEN OF LEAVES AND HUE AND SCENT OF FLOWERS
AND THE CHARM OF CHILDREN AND THE LOVE OF FRIENDS
AND THE BEAUTY OF WOMEN AND KINDLY HEARTS OF MEN
BUT SAW TOO THE DREADFUL POWERS THAT DRIVE HER MOODS
AND THE ANGUISH SHE HAS STREWN UPON HER WAYS
FATE WAITING ON THE UNSEEN STEPS OF MEN
AND HER EVIL AND SORROW AND LAST GIFT OF DEATH
A BREATH OF DISILLUSION AND DECADENCE
CORRUPTING WATCHED FOR LIFE'S MATURITY
AND MADE TO ROT THE FULL GRAIN OF THE SOUL
PROGRESS BECAME A PURVEYOR OF DEATH
A WORLD THAT CLUNG TO THE LAW OF A SLAIN LIGHT
CHERISHED THE PUTRID CORPSES OF DEAD TRUTHS
HAILED TWISTED FORMS AS THINGS FREE NEW AND TRUE
BEAUTY FROM UGLINESS AND EVIL DRANK
FEELING THEMSELVES GUESTS AT A BANQUET OF THE GODS
AND TASTED CORRUPTION LIKE A HIGH-SPICED FOOD
A DARKNESS SETTLED ON THE HEAVY AIR
IT HUNTED THE BRIGHT SMILE FROM NATURE'S LIPS
AND SLEW THE NATIVE CONFIDENCE IN HER HEART
AND PUT FEAR'S CROOKED LOOK INTO HER EYES
THE LUST THAT WARPS THE SPIRIT'S NATURAL GOOD
REPLACED BY A MANUFACTURED VIRTUE AND VICE
205
THE FRANK SPONTANEOUS IMPULSE OF THE SOUL
AFFLICTING NATURE WITH THE DUAL'S LIE
THEIR TWIN VALUES WHETTED A FORBIDDEN ZEST
MADE EVIL A RELIEF FROM SPURIOUS GOOD
THE EGO BATTENED ON RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SIN
AND EACH BECAME AN INSTRUMENT OF HELL
IN REJECTED HEAPS BY A MONOTONOUS ROAD
THE OLD SIMPLE DELIGHTS WERE LEFT TO LIE
ON THE WASTELAND OF LIFE'S DESCENT TO NIGHT
ALL GLORY OF LIFE WAS DIMMED TARNISHED WITH DOUBT
ALL BEAUTY ENDED IN AN AGING FACE
ALL POWER WAS DUBBED A TYRANNY CURSED BY GOD
AND TRUTH A FICTION NEEDED BY THE MIND
THE CHASE OF JOY WAS NOW A TIRED HUNT
ALL KNOWLEDGE WAS LEFT A QUESTIONING IGNORANCE
AS FROM A WOMB OBSCURE HE SAW EMERGE
THE BODY AND VISAGE OF A DARK UNSEEN
HIDDEN BEHIND THE FAIR OUTSIDES OF LIFE
ITS DANGEROUS COMMERCE IS OUR SUFFERING'S CAUSE
ITS BREATH IS A SUBTLE POISON IN MEN'S HEARTS
ALL EVIL STARTS FROM THAT AMBIGUOUS FACE
A PERIL HAUNTED NOW THE COMMON AIR
THE WORLD GREW FULL OF MENACING ENERGIES
AND WHEREVER TURNED FOR HELP OR HOPE HIS EYES
IN FIELD AND HOUSE IN STREET AND CAMP AND MART
HE MET THE PROWL AND STEALTHY COME AND GO
OF ARMED DISQUIETING BODIED INFLUENCES
A MARCH OF GODDESS FIGURES DARK AND NUDE
ALARMED THE AIR WITH GRANDIOSE UNEASE
APPALLING FOOTSTEPS DREW INVISIBLY NEAR
SHAPES THAT WERE THREATS INVADED THE DREAM-LIGHT
AND OMINOUS BEINGS PASSED HIM ON THE ROAD
WHOSE VERY GAZE WAS A CALAMITY
A CHARM AND SWEETNESS SUDDEN AND FORMIDABLE
FACES THAT RAISED ALLURING LIPS AND EYES
206
APPROACHED HIM ARMED WITH BEAUTY LIKE A SNARE
BUT HID A FATAL MEANING IN EACH LINE
AND COULD IN A MOMENT DANGEROUSLY CHANGE
BUT HE ALONE DISCERNED THAT SCREENED ATTACK
A VEIL UPON THE INNER VISION LAY
A FORCE WAS THERE THAT HID ITS DREADFUL STEPS
ALL WAS BELIED YET THOUGHT ITSELF THE TRUTH
ALL WERE BESET BUT KNEW NOT OF THE SIEGE
FOR NONE COULD SEE THE AUTHORS OF THEIR FALL
AWARE OF SOME DARK WISDOM STILL WITHHELD
THAT WAS THE SEAL AND WARRANT OF THIS STRENGTH
HE FOLLOWED THE TRACK OF DIM TREMENDOUS STEPS
RETURNING TO THE NIGHT FROM WHICH THEY CAME
A TRACT HE REACHED UNBUILT AND OWNED BY NONE
THERE ALL COULD ENTER BUT NONE STAY FOR LONG
IT WAS A NO MAN'S LAND OF EVIL AIR
A CROWDED NEIGHBOURHOOD WITHOUT ONE HOME
A BORDERLAND BETWEEN THE WORLD AND HELL
THERE UNREALITY WAS NATURE'S LORD
IT WAS A SPACE WHERE NOTHING COULD BE TRUE
FOR NOTHING WAS WHAT IT HAD CLAIMED TO BE
A HIGH APPEARANCE WRAPPED A SPECIOUS VOID
YET NOTHING WOULD CONFESS ITS OWN PRETENCE
EVEN TO ITSELF IN THE AMBIGUOUS HEART
A VAST DECEPTION WAS THE LAW OF THINGS
ONLY BY THAT DECEPTION THEY COULD LIVE
AN UNSUBSTANTIAL NIHIL GUARANTEED
THE FALSEHOOD OF THE FORMS THIS NATURE TOOK
AND MADE THEM SEEM AWHILE TO BE AND LIVE
A BORROWED MAGIC DREW THEM FROM THE VOID
THEY TOOK A SHAPE AND STUFF THAT WAS NOT THEIRS
AND SHOWED A COLOUR THAT THEY COULD NOT KEEP
MIRRORS TO A PHANTASM OF REALITY
EACH RAINBOW BRILLIANCE WAS A SPLENDID LIE
A BEAUTY UNREAL GRACED A GLAMOUR FACE
NOTHING COULD BE RELIED ON TO REMAIN
207
JOY NURTURED TEARS AND GOOD AN EVIL PROVED
BUT NEVER OUT OF EVIL ONE PLUCKED GOOD
LOVE ENDED EARLY IN HATE DELIGHT KILLED WITH PAIN
TRUTH INTO FALSITY GREW AND DEATH RULED LIFE
A POWER THAT LAUGHED AT THE MISCHIEFS OF THE WORLD
AN IRONY THAT JOINED THE WORLD'S CONTRARIES
AND FLUNG THEM INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS TO STRIVE
PUT A SARDONIC RICTUS ON GOD'S FACE
ALOOF ITS INFLUENCE ENTERED EVERYWHERE
AND LEFT A CLOVEN HOOF-MARK ON THE BREAST
A TWISTED HEART AND A STRANGE SOMBRE SMILE
MOCKED AT THE SINISTER COMEDY OF LIFE
ANNOUNCING THE ADVENT OF A PERILOUS FORM
AN OMINOUS TREAD SOFTENED ITS DIRE FOOTFALL
THAT NONE MIGHT UNDERSTAND OR BE ON GUARD
NONE HEARD UNTIL A DREADFUL GRASP WAS CLOSE
OR ELSE ALL AUGURED A DIVINE APPROACH
AN AIR OF PROPHECY FELT A HEAVENLY HOPE
LISTENED FOR A GOSPEL WATCHED FOR A NEW STAR
THE FIEND WAS VISIBLE BUT CLOAKED IN LIGHT
HE SEEMED A HELPING ANGEL FROM THE SKIES
HE ARMED UNTRUTH WITH SCRIPTURE AND THE LAW
HE DECEIVED WITH WISDOM WITH VIRTUE SLEW THE SOUL
AND LED TO PERDITION BY THE HEAVENWARD PATH
A LAVISH SENSE HE GAVE OF POWER AND JOY
AND WHEN AROSE THE WARNING FROM WITHIN
HE REASSURED THE EAR WITH DULCET TONES
OR TOOK THE MIND CAPTIVE IN ITS OWN NET
HIS RIGOROUS LOGIC MADE THE FALSE SEEM TRUE
AMAZING THE ELECT WITH HOLY LORE
HE SPOKE AS WITH THE VERY VOICE OF GOD
THE AIR WAS FULL OF TREACHERY AND RUSE
TRUTH-SPEAKING WAS A STRATAGEM IN THAT PLACE
AMBUSH LURKED IN A SMILE AND PERIL MADE
SAFETY ITS COVER TRUST ITS ENTRY'S GATE
FALSEHOOD CAME LAUGHING WITH THE EYES OF TRUTH
208
EACH FRIEND MIGHT TURN AN ENEMY OR SPY
THE HAND ONE CLASPED ENSLEEVED A DAGGER'S STAB
AND AN EMBRACE COULD BE DOOM'S IRON CAGE
AGONY AND DANGER STALKED THEIR TREMBLING PREY
AND SOFTLY SPOKE AS TO A TIMID FRIEND
ATTACK SPRANG SUDDENLY VEHEMENT AND UNSEEN
FEAR LEAPED UPON THE HEART AT EVERY TURN
AND CRIED OUT WITH AN ANGUISHED DREADFUL VOICE
IT CALLED FOR ONE TO SAVE BUT NONE CAME NEAR
ALL WARILY WALKED FOR DEATH WAS EVER CLOSE
YET CAUTION SEEMED A VAIN EXPENSE OF CARE
FOR ALL THAT GUARDED PROVED A DEADLY NET
AND WHEN AFTER LONG SUSPENSE SALVATION CAME
AND BROUGHT A GLAD RELIEF DISARMING STRENGTH
IT SERVED AS A SMILING PASSAGE TO WORSE FATE
THERE WAS NO TRUCE AND NO SAFE PLACE TO REST
ONE DARED NOT SLUMBER OR PUT OFF ONE'S ARMS
IT WAS A WORLD OF BATTLE AND SURPRISE
ALL WHO WERE THERE LIVED FOR THEMSELVES ALONE
ALL WARRED AGAINST ALL BUT WITH A COMMON HATE
TURNED ON THE MIND THAT SOUGHT SOME HIGHER GOOD
TRUTH WAS EXILED LEST SHE SHOULD DARE TO SPEAK
AND HURT THE HEART OF DARKNESS WITH HER LIGHT
OR BRING HER PRIDE OF KNOWLEDGE TO BLASPHEME
THE SETTLED ANARCHY OF ESTABLISHED THINGS
THEN THE SCENE CHANGED BUT KEPT ITS DREADFUL CORE
ALTERING ITS FORM THE LIFE REMAINED THE SAME
A CAPITAL WAS THERE WITHOUT A STATE
IT HAD NO RULER ONLY GROUPS THAT STROVE
HE SAW A CITY OF ANCIENT IGNORANCE
FOUNDED UPON A SOIL THAT KNEW NOT LIGHT
THERE EACH IN HIS OWN DARKNESS WALKED ALONE
ONLY THEY AGREED TO DIFFER IN EVIL'S PATHS
TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN WAY FOR THEIR OWN SELVES
OR TO ENFORCE A COMMON LIE AND WRONG
209
THERE EGO WAS LORD UPON HIS PEACOCK SEAT
AND FALSEHOOD SAT BY HIM HIS MATE AND QUEEN
THE WORLD TURNED TO THEM AS HEAVEN TO TRUTH AND GOD
INJUSTICE JUSTIFIED BY FIRM DECREES
THE SOVEREIGN WEIGHTS OF ERROR'S LEGALISED TRADE
BUT ALL THE WEIGHTS WERE FALSE AND NONE THE SAME
EVER SHE WATCHED WITH HER BALANCE AND A SWORD
LEST ANY SACRILEGIOUS WORD EXPOSE
THE SANCTIFIED FORMULAS OF HER OLD MISRULE
IN HIGH PROFESSIONS WRAPPED SELF-WILL WALKED WIDE
AND LICENCE STALKED PRATING OF ORDER AND RIGHT
THERE WAS NO ALTAR RAISED TO LIBERTY
TRUE FREEDOM WAS ABHORRED AND HUNTED DOWN
HARMONY AND TOLERANCE NOWHERE COULD BE SEEN
EACH GROUP PROCLAIMED ITS DIRE AND NAKED LAW
A FRAME OF ETHICS KNOBBED WITH SCRIPTURAL RULES
OR A THEORY PASSIONATELY BELIEVED AND PRAISED
A TABLE SEEMED OF HIGH HEAVEN'S SACRED CODE
A FORMAL PRACTICE MAILED AND IRON-SHOD
GAVE TO A RUDE AND RUTHLESS WARRIOR KIND
DRAWN FROM THE SAVAGE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
A PROUD STERN POISE OF HARSH NOBILITY
A CIVIC POSTURE RIGID AND FORMIDABLE
BUT ALL THEIR PRIVATE ACTS BELIED THE POSE
POWER AND UTILITY WERE THEIR TRUTH AND RIGHT
AN EAGLE RAPACITY CLAWED ITS COVETED GOOD
BEAKS PECKED AND TALONS TORE ALL WEAKER PREY
IN THEIR SWEET SECRECY OF PLEASANT SINS
NATURE THEY OBEYED AND NOT A MORALIST GOD
INCONSCIENT TRADERS IN BUNDLES OF CONTRARIES
THEY DID WHAT IN OTHERS THEY WOULD PERSECUTE
WHEN THEIR EYES LOOKED UPON THEIR FELLOW'S VICE
AN INDIGNATION FLAMED A VIRTUOUS WRATH
OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR OWN DEEP-HID OFFENCE
MOBLIKE THEY STONED A NEIGHBOUR CAUGHT IN SIN
A PRAGMATIST JUDGE WITHIN PASSED FALSE DECREES
210
POSED WORST INIQUITIES ON EQUITY'S BASE
REASONED ILL ACTIONS JUST SANCTIONED THE SCALE
OF THE MERCHANT EGO'S INTEREST AND DESIRE
THUS WAS A BALANCE KEPT THE WORLD COULD LIVE
A ZEALOT FERVOUR PUSHED THEIR RUTHLESS CULTS
ALL FAITH NOT THEIRS BLED SCOURGED AS HERESY
THEY QUESTIONED CAPTIVED TORTURED BURNED OR SMOTE
AND FORCED THE SOUL TO ABANDON RIGHT OR DIE
AMID HER CLASHING CREEDS AND WARRING SECTS
RELIGION SAT UPON A BLOOD-STAINED THRONE
A HUNDRED TYRANNIES OPPRESSED AND SLEW
AND FOUNDED UNITY UPON FRAUD AND FORCE
ONLY WHAT SEEMED WAS PRIZED AS REAL THERE
THE IDEAL WAS A CYNIC RIDICULE'S BUTT
HOOTED BY THE CROWD MOCKED BY ENLIGHTENED WITS
SPIRITUAL SEEKING WANDERED OUTCASTED
A DREAMER'S SELF-DECEIVING WEB OF THOUGHT
OR MAD CHIMAERA DEEMED OR HYPOCRITE'S FAKE
ITS PASSIONATE INSTINCT TRAILED THROUGH MINDS OBSCURE
LOST IN THE CIRCUITS OF THE IGNORANCE
A LIE WAS THERE THE TRUTH AND TRUTH A LIE
HERE MUST THE TRAVELLER OF THE UPWARD WAY
FOR DARING HELL'S KINGDOMS WINDS THE HEAVENLY ROUTE
PAUSE OR PASS SLOWLY THROUGH THAT PERILOUS SPACE
A PRAYER UPON HIS LIPS AND THE GREAT NAME
IF PROBED NOT ALL DISCERNMENT'S KEEN SPEAR-POINT
HE MIGHT STUMBLE INTO FALSITY'S ENDLESS NET
OVER HIS SHOULDER OFTEN HE MUST LOOK BACK
LIKE ONE WHO FEELS ON HIS NECK AN ENEMY'S BREATH
ELSE STEALING UP BEHIND A TREASONOUS BLOW
MIGHT PROSTRATE CAST AND PIN TO UNHOLY SOIL
PIERCED THROUGH HIS BACK BY EVIL'S POIGNANT STAKE
SO MIGHT ONE FALL ON THE ETERNAL'S ROAD
FORFEITING THE SPIRIT'S LONELY CHANCE IN TIME
AND NO NEWS OF HIM REACH THE WAITING GODS
MARKED MISSING IN THE REGISTER OF SOULS
211
HIS NAME THE INDEX OF A FAILING HOPE
THE POSITION OF A DEAD REMEMBERED STAR
ONLY WERE SAFE WHO KEPT GOD IN THEIR HEARTS
COURAGE THEIR ARMOUR FAITH THEIR SWORD THEY MUST WALK
THE HAND READY TO SMITE THE EYE TO SCOUT
CASTING A JAVELIN REGARD IN FRONT
HEROES AND SOLDIERS OF THE ARMY OF LIGHT
HARDLY EVEN SO THE GRISLY DANGER PAST
RELEASED INTO A CALMER PURER AIR
THEY DARED AT LENGTH TO BREATHE AND SMILE ONCE MORE
ONCE MORE THEY MOVED BENEATH A REAL SUN
THOUGH HELL CLAIMED RULE THE SPIRIT STILL HAD POWER
THIS NO-MAN'S-LAND HE PASSED WITHOUT DEBATE
HIM THE HEIGHTS MISSIONED HIM THE ABYSS DESIRED
NONE STOOD ACROSS HIS WAY NO VOICE FORBADE
FOR SWIFT AND EASY IS THE DOWNWARD PATH
AND NOW TOWARDS THE NIGHT WAS TURNED HIS FACE
A GREATER DARKNESS WAITED A WORSE REIGN
IF WORSE CAN BE WHERE ALL IS EVIL'S EXTREME
YET TO THE CLOAKED THE UNCLOAKED IS NAKED WORST
THERE GOD AND TRUTH AND THE SUPERNAL LIGHT
HAD NEVER BEEN OR ELSE HAD POWER NO MORE
AS WHEN ONE SLIPS IN A DEEP MOMENT'S TRANCE
OVER MIND'S BORDER INTO ANOTHER WORLD
HE CROSSED A BOUNDARY WHOSE STEALTHY TRACE
EYE COULD NOT SEE BUT ONLY THE SOUL FEEL
INTO AN ARMOURED FIERCE DOMAIN HE CAME
AND SAW HIMSELF WANDERING LIKE A LOST SOUL
AMID GRIMED WALLS AND SAVAGE SLUMS OF NIGHT
AROUND HIM CROWDED GREY AND SQUALID HUTS
NEIGHBOURING PROUD PALACES OF PERVERTED POWER
INHUMAN QUARTERS AND DEMONIAC WARDS
A PRIDE IN EVIL HUGGED ITS WRETCHEDNESS
A MISERY HAUNTING SPLENDOUR PRESSED THOSE FELL
DUN SUBURBS OF THE CITIES OF DREAM-LIFE
212
THERE LIFE DISPLAYED TO THE SPECTATOR SOUL
THE SHADOW DEPTHS OF HER STRANGE MIRACLE
A STRONG AND FALLEN GODDESS WITHOUT HOPE
OBSCURED DEFORMED BY SOME DIRE GORGON SPELL
AS MIGHT A HARLOT EMPRESS IN A BOUGE
NUDE UNASHAMED EXULTING SHE UPRAISED
HER EVIL FACE OF PERILOUS BEAUTY AND CHARM
AND DRAWING PANIC TO A SHUDDERING KISS
TWIXT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HER FATAL BREASTS
ALLURED TO THEIR ABYSS THE SPIRIT'S FALL
ACROSS HIS FIELD OF SIGHT SHE MULTIPLIED
AS ON A SCENIC FILM OR MOVING PLATE
THE IMPLACABLE SPLENDOUR OF HER NIGHTMARE POMPS
ON THE DARK BACKGROUND OF A SOULLESS WORLD
SHE STAGED BETWEEN A LURID LIGHT AND SHADE
HER DRAMAS OF THE SORROW OF THE DEPTHS
WRITTEN ON THE AGONISED NERVES OF LIVING THINGS
EPICS OF HORROR AND GRIM MAJESTY
WRY STATUES SPAT AND STIFFENED IN LIFE'S MUD
A GLUT OF HIDEOUS FORMS AND HIDEOUS DEEDS
PARALYSED PITY IN THE HARDENED BREAST
IN BOOTHS OF SIN AND NIGHT-REPAIRS OF VICE
STYLED INFAMIES OF THE BODY'S CONCUPISCENCE
AND SORDID IMAGINATIONS ETCHED IN FLESH
TURNED LUST INTO A DECORATIVE ART
ABUSING NATURE'S GIFT HER PERVERT SKILL
IMMORTALISED THE SOWN GRAIN OF LIVING DEATH
IN A MUD GOBLET POURED THE BACCHIC WINE
TO A SATYR GAVE THE THYRSUS OF A GOD
IMPURE SADISTIC WITH GRIMACING MOUTHS
GREY FOUL INVENTIONS GRUESOME AND MACABRE
CAME TELEVISIONED FROM THE GULFS OF NIGHT
HER CRAFT INGENIOUS IN MONSTROSITY
IMPATIENT OF ALL NATURAL SHAPE AND POISE
A GAPE OF NUDE EXAGGERATED LINES
GAVE CARICATURE A STARK REALITY
213
AND ART-PARADES OF WEIRD DISTORTED FORMS
AND GARGOYLE MASQUES OBSCENE AND TERRIBLE
TRAMPLED TO TORMENTED POSTURES THE TORN SENSE
AN INEXORABLE EVIL'S WORSHIPPER
SHE MADE VILENESS GREAT AND SUBLIMATED FILTH
A DRAGON POWER OF REPTILE ENERGIES
AND STRANGE EPIPHANIES OF GROVELLING FORCE
AND SERPENT GRANDEURS COUCHING IN THE MIRE
DREW ADORATION TO A GLEAM OF SLIME
ALL NATURE PULLED OUT OF HER FRAME AND BASE
WAS TWISTED INTO AN UNNATURAL POSE
REPULSION STIMULATED INERT DESIRE
AGONY WAS MADE A RED-SPICED FOOD FOR BLISS
HATRED WAS TRUSTED WITH THE WORK OF LUST
AND TORTURE TOOK THE FORM OF AN EMBRACE
A RITUAL ANGUISH CONSECRATED DEATH
WORSHIP WAS OFFERED TO THE UNDIVINE
A NEW AESTHESIS OF INFERNO'S ART
THAT TRAINED THE MIND TO LOVE WHAT THE SOUL HATES
IMPOSED ALLEGIANCE ON THE QUIVERING NERVES
AND FORCED THE UNWILLING BODY TO VIBRATE
TOO SWEET AND TOO HARMONIOUS TO EXCITE
IN THIS REGIME THAT SOILED THE BEING'S CORE
BEAUTY WAS BANNED THE HEART'S FEELING DULLED TO SLEEP
AND CHERISHED IN THEIR PLACE SENSATION'S THRILLS
THE WORLD WAS PROBED FOR JETS OF SENSE-APPEAL
HERE COLD MATERIAL INTELLECT WAS THE JUDGE
AND NEEDED SENSUAL PRICK AND JOG AND LASH
THAT ITS HARD DRYNESS AND DEAD NERVES MIGHT FEEL
SOME PASSION AND POWER AND ACRID POINT OF LIFE
A NEW PHILOSOPHY THEORISED EVIL'S RIGHTS
GLORIED IN THE SHIMMERING ROT OF DECADENCE
OR GAVE TO A PYTHON FORCE PERSUASIVE SPEECH
AND ARMED WITH KNOWLEDGE THE PRIMAEVAL BRUTE
OVER LIFE AND MATTER ONLY BROODING BOWED
MIND CHANGED TO THE IMAGE OF A RAMPANT BEAST
214
IT SCRAMBLED INTO THE PIT TO DIG FOR TRUTH
AND LIGHTED ITS SEARCH WITH THE SUBCONSCIENT'S FLARES
THENCE BUBBLING ROSE SULLYING THE UPPER AIR
THE FILTH AND FESTERING SECRETS OF THE ABYSS
THIS IT CALLED POSITIVE FACT AND REAL LIFE
THIS NOW COMPOSED THE FETID ATMOSPHERE
A WILD-BEAST PASSION CREPT FROM SECRET NIGHT
TO WATCH ITS PREY WITH FASCINATING EYES
AROUND HIM LIKE A FIRE WITH SPUTTERING TONGUES
THERE LOLLED AND LAUGHED A BESTIAL ECSTASY
THE AIR WAS PACKED WITH LONGINGS BRUTE AND FIERCE
CROWDING AND STINGING IN A MONSTROUS SWARM
PRESSED WITH A NOXIOUS HUM INTO HIS MIND
THOUGHTS THAT COULD POISON NATURE'S HEAVENLIEST BREATH
FORCING RELUCTANT LIDS ASSAILED THE SIGHT
ACTS THAT REVEALED THE MYSTERY OF HELL
ALL THAT WAS THERE WAS ON THIS PATTERN MADE
A RACE POSSESSED INHABITED THOSE PARTS
A FORCE DEMONIAC LURKING IN MAN'S DEPTHS
THAT HEAVES SUPPRESSED BY THE HEART'S HUMAN LAW
AWED BY THE CALM AND SOVEREIGN EYES OF THOUGHT
CAN IN A FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE OF THE SOUL
ARISE AND CALLING TO ITS NATIVE NIGHT
OVERTHROW THE REASON OCCUPY THE LIFE
AND STAMP ITS HOOF ON NATURE'S SHAKING GROUND
THIS WAS FOR THEM THEIR BEING'S FLAMING CORE
A MIGHTY ENERGY A MONSTER GOD
HARD TO THE STRONG IMPLACABLE TO THE WEAK
IT STARED AT THE HARSH UNPITYING WORLD IT MADE
WITH THE STONY EYELIDS OF ITS FIXED IDEA
ITS HEART WAS DRUNK WITH A DIRE HUNGER'S WINE
IN OTHERS' SUFFERING FELT A THRILLED DELIGHT
AND OF DEATH AND RUIN THE GRANDIOSE MUSIC HEARD
TO HAVE POWER TO BE MASTER WAS SOLE VIRTUE AND GOOD
IT CLAIMED THE WHOLE WORLD FOR EVIL'S LIVING ROOM
215
ITS PARTY'S GRIM TOTALITARIAN REIGN
THE CRUEL DESTINY OF BREATHING THINGS
ALL ON ONE PLAN WAS SHAPED AND STANDARDISED
UNDER A DARK DICTATORSHIP'S BREATHLESS WEIGHT
IN STREET AND HOUSE IN COUNCILS AND IN COURTS
BEINGS HE MET WHO LOOKED LIKE LIVING MEN
AND CLIMBED IN SPEECH UPON HIGH WINGS OF THOUGHT
BUT HARBOURED ALL THAT IS SUBHUMAN VILE
AND LOWER THAN THE LOWEST REPTILE'S CRAWL
THE REASON MEANT FOR NEARNESS TO THE GODS
AND UPLIFT TO HEAVENLY SCALE BY THE TOUCH OF MIND
ONLY ENHANCED BY ITS ENLIGHTENING RAY
THEIR INBORN NATURE'S WRY MONSTROSITY
OFTEN A FAMILIAR VISAGE STUDYING
JOYFULLY ENCOUNTERED AT SOME DANGEROUS TURN
HOPING TO RECOGNISE A LOOK OF LIGHT
HIS VISION WARNED BY THE SPIRIT'S INWARD EYE
DISCOVERED SUDDENLY HELL'S TRADEMARK THERE
OR SAW WITH THE INNER SENSE THAT CANNOT ERR
IN THE SEMBLANCE OF A FAIR OR VIRILE FORM
THE DEMON AND THE GOBLIN AND THE GHOUL
AN INSOLENCE REIGNED OF COLD STONE-HEARTED STRENGTH
MIGHTY OBEYED APPROVED BY THE TITAN'S LAW
THE HUGE LAUGHTER OF A GIANT CRUELTY
AND FIERCE GLAD DEEDS OF OGRE VIOLENCE
IN THAT WIDE CYNIC DEN OF THINKING BEASTS
ONE LOOKED IN VAIN FOR A TRACE OF PITY OR LOVE
THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF SWEETNESS ANYWHERE
BUT ONLY FORCE AND ITS ACOLYTES GREED AND HATE
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR SUFFERING NONE TO SAVE
NONE DARED RESIST OR SPEAK A NOBLE WORD
ARMED WITH THE AEGIS OF TYRANNIC POWER
SIGNING THE EDICTS OF HER DREADFUL RULE
AND USING BLOOD AND TORTURE AS A SEAL
DARKNESS PROCLAIMED HER SLOGANS TO THE WORLD
A SERVILE BLINKERED SILENCE HUSHED THE MIND
216
OR ONLY IT REPEATED LESSONS TAUGHT
WHILE MITRED HOLDING THE GOOD SHEPHERD'S STAFF
FALSEHOOD ENTHRONED ON AWED AND PROSTRATE HEARTS
THE CULTS AND CREEDS THAT ORGANISE LIVING DEATH
AND SLAY THE SOUL ON THE ALTAR OF A LIE
ALL WERE DECEIVED OR SERVED THEIR OWN DECEIT
TRUTH IN THAT STIFLING ATMOSPHERE COULD NOT LIVE
THERE WRETCHEDNESS BELIEVED IN ITS OWN JOY
AND FEAR AND WEAKNESS HUGGED THEIR ABJECT DEPTHS
ALL THAT IS LOW AND SORDID-THOUGHTED BASE
ALL THAT IS DRAB AND POOR AND MISERABLE
BREATHED IN A LAX CONTENT ITS NATURAL AIR
AND FELT NO YEARNING OF DIVINE RELEASE
ARROGANT GIBING AT MORE LUMINOUS STATES
THE PEOPLE OF THE GULFS DESPISED THE SUN
A BARRIERED AUTARCHY EXCLUDED LIGHT
FIXED IN ITS WILL TO BE ITS OWN GREY SELF
IT VAUNTED ITS NORM UNIQUE AND SPLENDID TYPE
IT SOOTHED ITS HUNGER WITH A PLUNDERER'S DREAM
FLAUNTING ITS CROSS OF SERVITUDE LIKE A CROWN
IT CLUNG TO ITS DISMAL HARSH AUTONOMY
A BULL-THROAT BELLOWED WITH ITS BRAZEN TONGUE
ITS HARD AND SHAMELESS CLAMOUR FILLING SPACE
AND THREATENING ALL WHO DARED TO LISTEN TO TRUTH
CLAIMED THE MONOPOLY OF THE BATTERED EAR
A DEAFENED ACQUIESCENCE GAVE ITS VOTE
AND BRAGGART DOGMAS SHOUTED IN THE NIGHT
KEPT FOR THE FALLEN SOUL ONCE DEEMED A GOD
THE PRIDE OF ITS ABYSMAL ABSOLUTE
A LONE DISCOVERER IN THESE MENACING REALMS
GUARDED LIKE TERMITE CITIES FROM THE SUN
OPPRESSED MID CROWD AND TRAMP AND NOISE AND FLARE
PASSING FROM DUSK TO DEEPER DANGEROUS DUSK
HE WRESTLED WITH POWERS THAT SNATCHED FROM MIND ITS LIGHT
AND SMOTE FROM HIM THEIR CLINGING INFLUENCES
217
SOON HE EMERGED IN A DIM WALL-LESS SPACE
FOR NOW THE PEOPLED TRACTS WERE LEFT BEHIND
HE WALKED BETWEEN WIDE BANKS OF FAILING EVE
AROUND HIM GREW A GAUNT SPIRITUAL BLANK
A THREATENING WASTE A SINISTER LONELINESS
THAT LEFT MIND BARE TO AN UNSEEN ASSAULT
AN EMPTY PAGE ON WHICH ALL THAT WILLED COULD WRITE
STARK MONSTROUS MESSAGES WITHOUT CONTROL
A TRAVELLING DOT ON DOWNWARD ROADS OF DUSK
MID BARREN FIELDS AND BARNS AND STRAGGLING HUTS
AND A FEW CROOKED AND PHANTASMAL TREES
HE FACED A SENSE OF DEATH AND CONSCIOUS VOID
BUT STILL A HOSTILE LIFE UNSEEN WAS THERE
WHOSE DEATHLIKE POISE RESISTING LIGHT AND TRUTH
MADE LIVING A BLEAK GAP IN NULLITY
HE HEARD THE GRISLY VOICES THAT DENY
ASSAILED BY THOUGHTS THAT SWARMED LIKE SPECTRAL HORDES
A PREY TO THE STARING PHANTOMS OF THE GLOOM
AND TERROR APPROACHING WITH ITS LETHAL MOUTH
DRIVEN BY A STRANGE WILL DOWN EVER DOWN
THE SKY ABOVE A COMMUNIQUE OF DOOM
HE STROVE TO SHIELD HIS SPIRIT FROM DESPAIR
BUT FELT THE HORROR OF THE GROWING NIGHT
AND THE ABYSS RISING TO CLAIM HIS SOUL
THEN CEASED THE ABODES OF CREATURES AND THEIR FORMS
AND SOLITUDE WRAPPED HIM IN ITS VOICELESS FOLDS
ALL VANISHED SUDDENLY LIKE A THOUGHT EXPUNGED
HIS SPIRIT BECAME AN EMPTY LISTENING GULF
VOID OF THE DEAD ILLUSION OF A WORLD
NOTHING WAS LEFT NOT EVEN AN EVIL FACE
HE WAS ALONE WITH THE GREY PYTHON NIGHT
A DENSE AND NAMELESS NOTHING CONSCIOUS MUTE
WHICH SEEMED ALIVE BUT WITHOUT BODY OR MIND
LUSTED ALL BEINGS TO ANNIHILATE
THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR EVER NUDE AND SOLE
AS IN A SHAPELESS BEAST'S INTANGIBLE JAWS
218
GRIPPED STRANGLED BY THAT LUSTING VISCOUS BLOT
ATTRACTED TO SOME BLACK AND GIANT MOUTH
AND SWALLOWING THROAT AND A HUGE BELLY OF DOOM
HIS BEING FROM ITS OWN VISION DISAPPEARED
DRAWN TOWARDS DEPTHS THAT HUNGERED FOR ITS FALL
A FORMLESS VOID OPPRESSED HIS STRUGGLING BRAIN
A DARKNESS GRIM AND COLD BENUMBED HIS FLESH
A WHISPERED GREY SUGGESTION CHILLED HIS HEART
HALED BY A SERPENT-FORCE FROM ITS WARM HOME
AND DRAGGED TO EXTINCTION IN BLEAK VACANCY
LIFE CLUNG TO ITS SEAT WITH CORDS OF GASPING BREATH
LAPPED WAS HIS BODY BY A TENEBROUS TONGUE
EXISTENCE SMOTHERED TRAVAILED TO SURVIVE
HOPE STRANGLED PERISHED IN HIS EMPTY SOUL
BELIEF AND MEMORY ABOLISHED DIED
AND ALL THAT HELPS THE SPIRIT IN ITS COURSE
THERE CRAWLED THROUGH EVERY TENSE AND ACHING NERVE
LEAVING BEHIND ITS POIGNANT QUAKING TRAIL
A NAMELESS AND UNUTTERABLE FEAR
AS A SEA NEARS A VICTIM BOUND AND STILL
THE APPROACH ALARMED HIS MIND FOR EVER DUMB
OF AN IMPLACABLE ETERNITY
OF PAIN INHUMAN AND INTOLERABLE
THIS HE MUST BEAR HIS HOPE OF HEAVEN ESTRANGED
HE MUST EVER EXIST WITHOUT EXTINCTION'S PEACE
IN A SLOW SUFFERING TIME AND TORTURED SPACE
AN ANGUISHED NOTHINGNESS HIS ENDLESS STATE
A LIFELESS VACANCY WAS NOW HIS BREAST
AND IN THE PLACE WHERE ONCE WAS LUMINOUS THOUGHT
ONLY REMAINED LIKE A PALE MOTIONLESS GHOST
AN INCAPACITY FOR FAITH AND HOPE
AND THE DREAD CONVICTION OF A VANQUISHED SOUL
IMMORTAL STILL BUT WITH ITS GODHEAD LOST
SELF LOST AND GOD AND TOUCH OF HAPPIER WORLDS
BUT HE ENDURED STILLED THE VAIN TERROR BORE
THE SMOTHERING COILS OF AGONY AND AFFRIGHT
219
THEN PEACE RETURNED AND THE SOUL'S SOVEREIGN GAZE
TO THE BLANK HORROR A CALM LIGHT REPLIED
IMMUTABLE UNDYING AND UNBORN
MIGHTY AND MUTE THE GODHEAD IN HIM WOKE
AND FACED THE PAIN AND DANGER OF THE WORLD
HE MASTERED THE TIDES OF NATURE WITH A LOOK
HE MET WITH HIS BARE SPIRIT NAKED HELL
220
THEN COULD HE SEE THE HIDDEN HEART OF NIGHT
THE LABOUR OF ITS STARK UNCONSCIOUSNESS
REVEALED THE ENDLESS TERRIBLE INANE
A SPIRITLESS BLANK INFINITY WAS THERE
A NATURE THAT DENIED THE ETERNAL TRUTH
IN THE VAIN BRAGGART FREEDOM OF ITS THOUGHT
HOPED TO ABOLISH GOD AND REIGN ALONE
THERE WAS NO SOVEREIGN GUEST NO WITNESS LIGHT
UNHELPED IT WOULD CREATE ITS OWN BLEAK WORLD
ITS LARGE BLIND EYES LOOKED OUT ON DEMON ACTS
ITS DEAF EARS HEARD THE UNTRUTH ITS DUMB LIPS SPOKE
ITS HUGE MISGUIDED FANCY TOOK VAST SHAPES
ITS MINDLESS SENTIENCE QUIVERED WITH FIERCE CONCEITS
ENGENDERING A BRUTE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE
EVIL AND PAIN BEGOT A MONSTROUS SOUL
THE ANARCHS OF THE FORMLESS DEPTHS AROSE
GREAT TITAN BEINGS AND DEMONIAC POWERS
WORLD-EGOS RACKED WITH LUST AND THOUGHT AND WILL
VAST MINDS AND LIVES WITHOUT A SPIRIT WITHIN
IMPATIENT ARCHITECTS OF ERROR'S HOUSE
LEADERS OF THE COSMIC IGNORANCE AND UNREST
AND SPONSORS OF SORROW AND MORTALITY
EMBODIED THE DARK IDEAS OF THE ABYSS
A SHADOW SUBSTANCE INTO EMPTINESS CAME
DIM FORMS WERE BORN IN THE UNTHINKING VOID
AND EDDIES MET AND MADE AN ADVERSE SPACE
IN WHOSE BLACK FOLDS BEING IMAGINED HELL
HIS EYES PIERCING THE TRIPLE-PLATED GLOOM
IDENTIFIED THEIR SIGHT WITH ITS BLIND STARE
ACCUSTOMED TO THE UNNATURAL DARK THEY SAW
221
UNREALITY MADE REAL AND CONSCIOUS NIGHT
A VIOLENT FIERCE AND FORMIDABLE WORLD
AN ANCIENT WOMB OF HUGE CALAMITOUS DREAMS
COILED LIKE A LARVA IN THE OBSCURITY
THAT KEEPS IT FROM THE SPEAR-POINTS OF HEAVEN'S STARS
IT WAS THE GATE OF A FALSE INFINITE
AN ETERNITY OF DISASTROUS ABSOLUTES
AN IMMENSE NEGATION OF SPIRITUAL THINGS
ALL ONCE SELF-LUMINOUS IN THE SPIRIT'S SPHERE
TURNED NOW INTO THEIR OWN DARK CONTRARIES
BEING COLLAPSED INTO A POINTLESS VOID
THAT YET WAS A ZERO PARENT OF THE WORLDS
INCONSCIENCE SWALLOWING UP THE COSMIC MIND
PRODUCED A UNIVERSE FROM ITS LETHAL SLEEP
BLISS INTO BLACK COMA FALLEN INSENSIBLE
COILED BACK TO ITSELF AND GOD'S ETERNAL JOY
THROUGH A FALSE POIGNANT FIGURE OF GRIEF AND PAIN
STILL DOLOROUSLY NAILED UPON A CROSS
FIXED IN THE SOIL OF A DUMB INSENTIENT WORLD
WHERE BIRTH WAS A PANG AND DEATH AN AGONY
LEST ALL TOO SOON SHOULD CHANGE AGAIN TO BLISS
THOUGHT SAT A PRIESTESS OF PERVERSITY
ON HER BLACK TRIPOD OF THE TRIUNE SNAKE
READING BY OPPOSITE SIGNS THE ETERNAL SCRIPT
A SORCERESS REVERSING LIFE'S GOD-FRAME
IN DARKLING AISLES WITH EVIL EYES FOR LAMPS
AND FATAL VOICES CHANTING FROM THE APSE
IN STRANGE INFERNAL DIM BASILICAS
INTONING THE MAGIC OF THE UNHOLY WORD
THE OMINOUS PROFOUND INITIATE
PERFORMED THE RITUAL OF HER MYSTERIES
THERE SUFFERING WAS NATURE'S DAILY FOOD
ALLURING TO THE ANGUISHED HEART AND FLESH
AND TORTURE WAS THE FORMULA OF DELIGHT
PAIN MIMICKED THE CELESTIAL ECSTASY
THERE GOOD A FAITHLESS GARDENER OF GOD
222
WATERED WITH VIRTUE THE WORLD'S UPAS-TREE
AND CAREFUL OF THE OUTWARD WORD AND ACT
ENGRAFTED HIS HYPOCRITE BLOOMS ON NATIVE ILL
ALL HIGH THINGS SERVED THEIR NETHER OPPOSITE
THE FORMS OF GODS SUSTAINED A DEMON CULT
HEAVEN'S FACE BECAME A MASK AND SNARE OF HELL
THERE IN THE HEART OF VAIN PHENOMENON
IN AN ENORMOUS ACTION'S WRITHEN CORE
HE SAW A SHAPE ILLIMITABLE AND VAGUE
SITTING ON DEATH WHO SWALLOWS ALL THINGS BORN
A CHILL FIXED FACE WITH DIRE AND MOTIONLESS EYES
HER DREADFUL TRIDENT IN HER SHADOWY HAND
OUTSTRETCHED SHE PIERCED ALL CREATURES WITH ONE FATE
WHEN NOTHING WAS SAVE MATTER WITHOUT SOUL
AND A SPIRITLESS HOLLOW WAS THE HEART OF TIME
THEN LIFE FIRST TOUCHED THE INSENSIBLE ABYSS
AWAKING THE STARK VOID TO HOPE AND GRIEF
HER PALLID BEAM SMOTE THE UNFATHOMED NIGHT
IN WHICH GOD HID HIMSELF FROM HIS OWN VIEW
IN ALL THINGS SHE SOUGHT THEIR SLUMBERING MYSTIC TRUTH
THE UNSPOKEN WORD THAT INSPIRES UNCONSCIOUS FORMS
SHE GROPED IN HIS DEEPS FOR AN INVISIBLE LAW
FUMBLED IN THE DIM SUBCONSCIENT FOR HIS MIND
AND STROVE TO FIND A WAY FOR SPIRIT TO BE
BUT FROM THE NIGHT ANOTHER ANSWER CAME
A SEED WAS IN THAT NETHER MATRIX CAST
A DUMB UNPROBED HUSK OF PERVERTED TRUTH
A CELL OF AN INSENTIENT INFINITE
A MONSTROUS BIRTH PREPARED ITS COSMIC FORM
IN NATURE'S TITAN EMBRYO IGNORANCE
THEN IN A FATAL AND STUPENDOUS HOUR
SOMETHING THAT SPRANG FROM THE STARK INCONSCIENT'S SLEEP
UNWILLINGLY BEGOTTEN BY THE MUTE VOID
LIFTED ITS OMINOUS HEAD AGAINST THE STARS
OVERSHADOWING EARTH WITH ITS HUGE BODY OF DOOM
223
IT CHILLED THE HEAVENS WITH THE MENACE OF A FACE
A NAMELESS POWER A SHADOWY WILL AROSE
IMMENSE AND ALIEN TO OUR UNIVERSE
IN THE INCONCEIVABLE PURPOSE NONE CAN GAUGE
A VAST NON-BEING ROBED ITSELF WITH SHAPE
THE BOUNDLESS NESCIENCE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS DEPTHS
COVERED ETERNITY WITH NOTHINGNESS
A SEEKING MIND REPLACED THE SEEING SOUL
LIFE GREW INTO A HUGE AND HUNGRY DEATH
THE SPIRIT'S BLISS WAS CHANGED TO COSMIC PAIN
ASSURING GOD'S SELF-COWLED NEUTRALITY
A MIGHTY OPPOSITION CONQUERED SPACE
A SOVEREIGN RULING FALSEHOOD DEATH AND GRIEF
IT PRESSED ITS FIERCE HEGEMONY ON THE EARTH
DISHARMONISING THE ORIGINAL STYLE
OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF HER FATE'S DESIGN
IT FALSIFIED THE PRIMAL COSMIC WILL
AND BOUND TO STRUGGLE AND DREAD VICISSITUDES
THE LONG SLOW PROCESS OF THE PATIENT POWER
IMPLANTING ERROR IN THE STUFF OF THINGS
IT MADE AN IGNORANCE OF THE ALL-WISE LAW
IT BAFFLED THE SURE TOUCH OF LIFE'S HID SENSE
KEPT DUMB THE INTUITIVE GUIDE IN MATTER'S SLEEP
DEFORMED THE INSECT'S INSTINCT AND THE BRUTE'S
DISFIGURED MAN'S THOUGHT-BORN HUMANITY
A SHADOW FELL ACROSS THE SIMPLE RAY
OBSCURED WAS THE TRUTH-LIGHT IN THE CAVERN HEART
THAT BURNS UNWITNESSED IN THE ALTAR CRYPT
BEHIND THE STILL VELAMEN'S SECRECY
COMPANIONING THE GODHEAD OF THE SHRINE
THUS WAS THE DIRE ANTAGONIST ENERGY BORN
WHO MIMES THE ETERNAL MOTHER'S MIGHTY SHAPE
AND MOCKS HER LUMINOUS INFINITY
WITH A GREY DISTORTED SILHOUETTE IN THE NIGHT
ARRESTING THE PASSION OF THE CLIMBING SOUL
SHE FORCED ON LIFE A SLOW AND FALTERING PACE
224
HER HAND'S DEFLECTING AND RETARDING WEIGHT
IS LAID ON THE MYSTIC EVOLUTION'S CURVE
THE TORTUOUS LINE OF HER DECEIVING MIND
THE GODS SEE NOT AND MAN IS IMPOTENT
OPPRESSING THE GOD-SPARK WITHIN THE SOUL
SHE FORCES BACK TO THE BEAST THE HUMAN FALL
YET IN HER FORMIDABLE INSTINCTIVE MIND
SHE FEELS THE ONE GROW IN THE HEART OF TIME
AND SEES THE IMMORTAL SHINE THROUGH THE HUMAN MOULD
ALARMED FOR HER RULE AND FULL OF FEAR AND RAGE
SHE PROWLS AROUND EACH LIGHT THAT GLEAMS THROUGH THE DARK
CASTING ITS RAY FROM THE SPIRIT'S LONELY TENT
HOPING TO ENTER WITH FIERCE STEALTHY TREAD
AND IN THE CRADLE SLAY THE DIVINE CHILD
INCALCULABLE ARE HER STRENGTH AND RUSE
HER TOUCH IS A FASCINATION AND A DEATH
SHE KILLS HER VICTIM WITH HIS OWN DELIGHT
EVEN GOOD SHE MAKES A HOOK TO DRAG TO HELL
FOR HER THE WORLD RUNS TO ITS AGONY
OFTEN THE PILGRIM ON THE ETERNAL'S ROAD
ILL-LIT FROM CLOUDS BY THE PALE MOON OF MIND
OR IN DEVIOUS BYWAYS WANDERING ALONE
OR LOST IN DESERTS WHERE NO PATH IS SEEN
FALLS OVERPOWERED BY HER LION LEAP
A CONQUERED CAPTIVE UNDER HER DREADFUL PAWS
INTOXICATED BY A BURNING BREATH
AND AMOROUS GROWN OF A DESTROYING MOUTH
ONCE A COMPANION OF THE SACRED FIRE
THE MORTAL PERISHES TO GOD AND LIGHT
AN ADVERSARY GOVERNS HEART AND BRAIN
A NATURE HOSTILE TO THE MOTHER-FORCE
THE SELF OF LIFE YIELDS UP ITS INSTRUMENTS
TO TITAN AND DEMONIAC AGENCIES
THAT AGGRANDISE EARTH-NATURE AND DISFRAME
A COWLED FIFTH-COLUMNIST IS NOW THOUGHT'S GUIDE
HIS SUBTLE DEFEATIST MURMUR SLAYS THE FAITH
225
AND LODGED IN THE BREAST OR WHISPERING FROM OUTSIDE
A LYING INSPIRATION FELL AND DARK
A NEW ORDER SUBSTITUTES FOR THE DIVINE
A SILENCE FALLS UPON THE SPIRIT'S HEIGHTS
FROM THE VEILED SANCTUARY THE GOD RETIRES
EMPTY AND COLD IS THE CHAMBER OF THE BRIDE
THE GOLDEN NIMBUS NOW IS SEEN NO MORE
NO LONGER BURNS THE WHITE SPIRITUAL RAY
AND HUSHED FOR EVER IS THE SECRET VOICE
THEN BY THE ANGEL OF THE VIGIL TOWER
A NAME IS STRUCK FROM THE RECORDING BOOK
A FLAME THAT SANG IN HEAVEN SINKS QUENCHED AND MUTE
IN RUIN ENDS THE EPIC OF A SOUL
THIS IS THE TRAGEDY OF THE INNER DEATH
WHEN FORFEITED IS THE DIVINE ELEMENT
AND ONLY A MIND AND BODY LIVE TO DIE
FOR TERRIBLE AGENCIES THE SPIRIT ALLOWS
AND THERE ARE SUBTLE AND ENORMOUS POWERS
THAT SHIELD THEMSELVES WITH THE COVERING IGNORANCE
OFFSPRING OF THE GULFS AGENTS OF THE SHADOWY FORCE
HATERS OF LIGHT INTOLERANT OF PEACE
APING TO THE THOUGHT THE SHINING FRIEND AND GUIDE
OPPOSING IN THE HEART THE ETERNAL WILL
THEY VEIL THE OCCULT UPLIFTING HARMONIST
HIS WISDOM'S ORACLES ARE MADE OUR BONDS
THE DOORS OF GOD THEY HAVE LOCKED WITH KEYS OF CREED
AND SHUT OUT BY THE LAW HIS TIRELESS GRACE
ALONG ALL NATURE'S LINES THEY HAVE SET THEIR POSTS
AND INTERCEPT THE CARAVANS OF LIGHT
WHEREVER THE GODS ACT THEY INTERVENE
A YOKE IS LAID UPON THE WORLD'S DIM HEART
MASKED ARE ITS BEATS FROM THE SUPERNAL BLISS
AND THE CLOSED PERIPHERIES OF BRILLIANT MIND
BLOCK THE FINE ENTRIES OF CELESTIAL FIRE
ALWAYS THE DARK ADVENTURERS SEEM TO WIN
226
NATURE THEY FILL WITH EVIL'S INSTITUTES
TURN INTO DEFEATS THE VICTORIES OF TRUTH
PROCLAIM AS FALSEHOODS THE ETERNAL LAWS
AND LOAD THE DICE OF DOOM WITH WIZARD LIES
THE WORLD'S SHRINES THEY HAVE OCCUPIED USURPED ITS THRONES
IN SCORN OF THE DWINDLING CHANCES OF THE GODS
THEY CLAIM CREATION AS THEIR CONQUERED FIEF
AND CROWN THEMSELVES THE IRON LORDS OF TIME
ADEPTS OF THE ILLUSION AND THE MASK
THE ARTIFICERS OF NATURE'S FALL AND PAIN
HAVE BUILT THEIR ALTARS OF TRIUMPHANT NIGHT
IN THE CLAY TEMPLE OF TERRESTRIAL LIFE
IN THE VACANT PRECINCTS OF THE SACRED FIRE
IN FRONT OF THE REREDOS IN THE MYSTIC RITE
FACING THE DIM VELAMEN NONE CAN PIERCE
INTONES HIS SOLEMN HYMN THE MITRED PRIEST
INVOKING THEIR DREADFUL PRESENCE IN HIS BREAST
ATTRIBUTING TO THEM THE AWFUL NAME
HE CHANTS THE SYLLABLES OF THE MAGIC TEXT
AND SUMMONS THE UNSEEN COMMUNION'S ACT
WHILE TWIXT THE INCENSE AND THE MUTTERED PRAYER
ALL THE FIERCE BALE WITH WHICH THE WORLD IS RACKED
IS MIXED IN THE FOAMING CHALICE OF MAN'S HEART
AND POURED TO THEM LIKE SACRAMENTAL WINE
ASSUMING NAMES DIVINE THEY GUIDE AND RULE
OPPONENTS OF THE HIGHEST THEY HAVE COME
OUT OF THEIR WORLD OF SOULLESS THOUGHT AND POWER
TO SERVE BY ENMITY THE COSMIC SCHEME
NIGHT IS THEIR REFUGE AND STRATEGIC BASE
AGAINST THE SWORD OF FLAME THE LUMINOUS EYE
BASTIONED THEY LIVE IN MASSIVE FORTS OF GLOOM
CALM AND SECURE IN SUNLESS PRIVACY
NO WANDERING RAY OF HEAVEN CAN ENTER THERE
ARMOURED PROTECTED BY THEIR LETHAL MASKS
AS IN A STUDIO OF CREATIVE DEATH
THE GIANT SONS OF DARKNESS SIT AND PLAN
227
THE DRAMA OF THE EARTH THEIR TRAGIC STAGE
ALL WHO WOULD RAISE THE FALLEN WORLD MUST COME
UNDER THE DANGEROUS ARCHES OF THEIR POWER
FOR EVEN THE RADIANT CHILDREN OF THE GODS
TO DARKEN THEIR PRIVILEGE IS AND DREADFUL RIGHT
NONE CAN REACH HEAVEN WHO HAS NOT PASSED THROUGH HELL
THIS TOO THE TRAVELLER OF THE WORLDS MUST DARE
A WARRIOR IN THE DATELESS DUEL'S STRIFE
HE ENTERED INTO DUMB DESPAIRING NIGHT
CHALLENGING THE DARKNESS WITH HIS LUMINOUS SOUL
ALARMING WITH HIS STEPS THE THRESHOLD GLOOM
HE CAME INTO A FIERCE AND DOLOROUS REALM
PEOPLED BY SOULS WHO NEVER HAD TASTED BLISS
IGNORANT LIKE MEN BORN BLIND WHO KNOW NOT LIGHT
THEY COULD EQUATE WORST ILL WITH HIGHEST GOOD
VIRTUE WAS TO THEIR EYES A FACE OF SIN
AND EVIL AND MISERY WERE THEIR NATURAL STATE
A DIRE ADMINISTRATION'S PENAL CODE
MAKING OF GRIEF AND PAIN THE COMMON LAW
DECREEING UNIVERSAL JOYLESSNESS
HAD CHANGED LIFE INTO A STOIC SACRAMENT
AND TORTURE INTO A DAILY FESTIVAL
AN ACT WAS PASSED TO CHASTISE HAPPINESS
LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE WERE BANNED AS DEADLY SINS
A QUESTIONLESS MIND WAS RANKED AS WISE CONTENT
A DULL HEART'S SILENT APATHY AS PEACE
SLEEP WAS NOT THERE TORPOR WAS THE SOLE REST
DEATH CAME BUT NEITHER RESPITE GAVE NOR END
ALWAYS THE SOUL LIVED ON AND SUFFERED MORE
EVER HE DEEPER PROBED THAT KINGDOM OF PAIN
AROUND HIM GREW THE TERROR OF A WORLD
OF AGONY FOLLOWED BY WORSE AGONY
AND IN THE TERROR A GREAT WICKED JOY
GLAD OF ONE'S OWN AND OTHERS' CALAMITY
THERE THOUGHT AND LIFE WERE A LONG PUNISHMENT
228
THE BREATH A BURDEN AND ALL HOPE A SCOURGE
THE BODY A FIELD OF TORMENT A MASSED UNEASE
REPOSE WAS A WAITING BETWEEN PANG AND PANG
THIS WAS THE LAW OF THINGS NONE DREAMED TO CHANGE
A HARD SOMBRE HEART A HARSH UNSMILING MIND
REJECTED HAPPINESS LIKE A CLOYING SWEET
TRANQUILLITY WAS A TEDIUM AND ENNUI
ONLY BY SUFFERING LIFE GREW COLOURFUL
IT NEEDED THE SPICE OF PAIN THE SALT OF TEARS
IF ONE COULD CEASE TO BE ALL WOULD BE WELL
ELSE ONLY FIERCE SENSATIONS GAVE SOME ZEST
A FURY OF JEALOUSY BURNING THE GNAWED HEART
THE STING OF MURDEROUS SPITE AND HATE AND LUST
THE WHISPER THAT LURES TO THE PIT AND TREACHERY'S STROKE
THREW VIVID SPOTS ON THE DULL ACHING HOURS
TO WATCH THE DRAMA OF INFELICITY
THE WRITHING OF CREATURES UNDER THE HARROW OF DOOM
AND SORROW'S TRAGIC GAZE INTO THE NIGHT
AND HORROR AND THE HAMMERING HEART OF FEAR
WERE THE INGREDIENTS IN TIME'S HEAVY CUP
THAT PLEASED AND HELPED TO ENJOY ITS BITTER TASTE
OF SUCH FIERCE STUFF WAS MADE UP LIFE'S LONG HELL
THESE WERE THE THREADS OF THE DARK SPIDER'S-WEB
IN WHICH THE SOUL WAS CAUGHT QUIVERING AND RAPT
THIS WAS RELIGION THIS WAS NATURE'S RULE
IN A FELL CHAPEL OF INIQUITY
TO WORSHIP A BLACK PITILESS IMAGE OF POWER
KNEELING ONE MUST CROSS HARD-HEARTED STONY COURTS
A PAVEMENT LIKE A FLOOR OF EVIL FATE
EACH STONE WAS A KEEN EDGE OF RUTHLESS FORCE
AND GLUED WITH THE CHILLED BLOOD FROM TORTURED BREASTS
THE DRY GNARLED TREES STOOD UP LIKE DYING MEN
STIFFENED INTO A POSE OF AGONY
AND FROM EACH WINDOW PEERED AN OMINOUS PRIEST
CHANTING TE DEUMS FOR SLAUGHTER'S CROWNING GRACE
UPROOTED CITIES BLASTED HUMAN HOMES
BURNED WRITHEN BODIES THE BOMBSHELL'S MASSACRE
229
OUR ENEMIES ARE FALLEN ARE FALLEN THEY SANG
ALL WHO ONCE STAYED OUR WILL ARE SMITTEN AND DEAD
HOW GREAT WE ARE HOW MERCIFUL ART THOU
THUS THOUGHT THEY TO REACH GOD'S IMPASSIVE THRONE
AND HIM COMMAND WHOM ALL THEIR ACTS OPPOSED
MAGNIFYING THEIR DEEDS TO TOUCH HIS SKIES
AND MAKE HIM AN ACCOMPLICE OF THEIR CRIMES
THERE NO RELENTING PITY COULD HAVE PLACE
BUT RUTHLESS STRENGTH AND IRON MOODS HAD SWAY
A DATELESS SOVEREIGNTY OF TERROR AND GLOOM
THIS TOOK THE FIGURE OF A DARKENED GOD
REVERED BY THE RACKED WRETCHEDNESS HE HAD MADE
WHO HELD IN THRALL A MISERABLE WORLD
AND HELPLESS HEARTS NAILED TO UNCEASING WOE
ADORED THE FEET THAT TRAMPLED THEM INTO MIRE
IT WAS A WORLD OF SORROW AND OF HATE
SORROW WITH HATRED FOR ITS LONELY JOY
HATRED WITH OTHERS' SORROW AS ITS FEAST
A BITTER RICTUS CURLED THE SUFFERING MOUTH
A TRAGIC CRUELTY SAW ITS OMINOUS CHANCE
HATE WAS THE BLACK ARCHANGEL OF THAT REALM
IT GLOWED A SOMBRE JEWEL IN THE HEART
BURNING THE SOUL WITH ITS MALIGNANT RAYS
AND WALLOWED IN ITS FELL ABYSM OF MIGHT
THESE PASSIONS EVEN OBJECTS SEEMED TO EXUDE
FOR MIND OVERFLOWED INTO THE INANIMATE
THAT ANSWERED WITH THE WICKEDNESS IT RECEIVED
AGAINST THEIR USERS USED MALIGNANT POWERS
HURT WITHOUT HANDS AND STRANGELY SUDDENLY SLEW
APPOINTED AS INSTRUMENTS OF AN UNSEEN DOOM
OR THEY MADE THEMSELVES A FATEFUL PRISON WALL
WHERE MEN CONDEMNED WAKE THROUGH THE CREEPING HOURS
COUNTED BY THE TOLLINGS OF AN OMINOUS BELL
AN EVIL ENVIRONMENT WORSENED EVIL SOULS
ALL THINGS WERE CONSCIOUS THERE AND ALL PERVERSE
IN THIS INFERNAL REALM HE DARED TO PRESS
EVEN INTO ITS DEEPEST PIT AND DARKEST CORE
230
PERTURBED ITS TENEBROUS BASE DARED TO CONTEST
ITS ANCIENT PRIVILEGED RIGHT AND ABSOLUTE FORCE
IN NIGHT HE PLUNGED TO KNOW HER DREADFUL HEART
IN HELL HE SOUGHT THE ROOT AND CAUSE OF HELL
ITS ANGUISHED GULFS OPENED IN HIS OWN BREAST
HE LISTENED TO CLAMOURS OF ITS CROWDED PAIN
THE HEART-BEATS OF ITS FATAL LONELINESS
ABOVE WAS A CHILL DEAF ETERNITY
IN VAGUE TREMENDOUS PASSAGES OF DOOM
HE HEARD THE GOBLIN VOICE THAT GUIDES TO SLAY
AND FACED THE ENCHANTMENTS OF THE DEMON SIGN
AND TRAVERSED THE AMBUSH OF THE OPPONENT SNAKE
IN MENACING TRACTS IN TORTURED SOLITUDES
COMPANIONLESS HE ROAMED THROUGH DESOLATE WAYS
WHERE THE RED WOLF WAITS BY THE FORDLESS STREAM
AND DEATH'S BLACK EAGLES SCREAM TO THE PRECIPICE
AND MET THE HOUNDS OF BALE WHO HUNT MEN'S HEARTS
BAYING ACROSS THE VELDTS OF DESTINY
IN FOOTLESS BATTLEFIELDS OF THE ABYSS
FOUGHT SHADOWY COMBATS IN MUTE EYELESS DEPTHS
ASSAULTS OF HELL ENDURED AND TITAN STROKES
AND BORE THE FIERCE INNER WOUNDS THAT ARE SLOW TO HEAL
A PRISONER OF A HOODED MAGIC FORCE
CAPTURED AND TRAILED IN FALSEHOOD'S LETHAL NET
AND OFTEN STRANGLED IN THE NOOSE OF GRIEF
OR CAST IN THE GRIM MORASS OF SWALLOWING DOUBT
OR SHUT INTO PITS OF ERROR AND DESPAIR
HE DRANK HER POISON DRAUGHTS TILL NONE WAS LEFT
IN A WORLD WHERE NEITHER HOPE NOR JOY COULD COME
THE ORDEAL HE SUFFERED OF EVIL'S ABSOLUTE REIGN
YET KEPT INTACT HIS SPIRIT'S RADIANT TRUTH
INCAPABLE OF MOTION OR OF FORCE
IN MATTER'S BLANK DENIAL GAOLED AND BLIND
PINNED TO THE BLACK INERTIA OF OUR BASE
HE TREASURED BETWEEN HIS HANDS HIS FLICKERING SOUL
HIS BEING VENTURED INTO MINDLESS VOID
INTOLERANT GULFS THAT KNEW NOT THOUGHT NOR SENSE
231
THOUGHT CEASED SENSE FAILED HIS SOUL STILL SAW AND KNEW
IN ATOMIC PARCELLINGS OF THE INFINITE
NEAR TO THE DUMB BEGINNINGS OF LOST SELF
HE FELT THE CURIOUS SMALL FUTILITY
OF THE CREATION OF MATERIAL THINGS
OR STIFLED IN THE INCONSCIENT'S HOLLOW DUSK
HE SOUNDED THE MYSTERY DARK AND BOTTOMLESS
OF THE ENORMOUS AND UNMEANING DEEPS
WHENCE STRUGGLING LIFE IN A DEAD UNIVERSE ROSE
THERE IN THE STARK IDENTITY LOST BY MIND
HE FELT THE SEALED SENSE OF THE INSENSIBLE WORLD
AND A MUTE WISDOM IN THE UNKNOWING NIGHT
INTO THE ABYSMAL SECRECY HE CAME
WHERE DARKNESS PEERS FROM HER MATTRESS GREY AND NUDE
AND STOOD ON THE LAST LOCKED SUBCONSCIENT'S FLOOR
WHERE BEING SLEPT UNCONSCIOUS OF ITS THOUGHTS
AND BUILT THE WORLD NOT KNOWING WHAT IT BUILT
THERE WAITING ITS HOUR THE FUTURE LAY UNKNOWN
THERE IS THE RECORD OF THE VANISHED STARS
THERE IN THE SLUMBER OF THE COSMIC WILL
HE SAW THE SECRET KEY OF NATURE'S CHANGE
A LIGHT WAS WITH HIM AN INVISIBLE HAND
WAS LAID UPON THE ERROR AND THE PAIN
TILL IT BECAME A QUIVERING ECSTASY
THE SHOCK OF SWEETNESS OF AN ARM'S EMBRACE
HE SAW IN NIGHT THE ETERNAL'S SHADOWY VEIL
KNEW DEATH FOR A CELLAR OF THE HOUSE OF LIFE
IN DESTRUCTION FELT CREATION'S HASTY PACE
KNEW LOSS AS THE PRICE OF A CELESTIAL GAIN
AND HELL AS A SHORT CUT TO HEAVEN'S GATES
THEN IN ILLUSION'S OCCULT FACTORY
AND IN THE INCONSCIENT'S MAGIC PRINTING-HOUSE
TORN WERE THE FORMATS OF THE PRIMAL NIGHT
AND SHATTERED THE STEREOTYPES OF IGNORANCE
ALIVE BREATHING A DEEP SPIRITUAL BREATH
NATURE EXPUNGED HER STIFF MECHANICAL CODE
AND THE ARTICLES OF THE BOUND SOUL'S CONTRACT
232
FALSEHOOD GAVE BACK TO TRUTH HER TORTURED SHAPE
ANNULLED WERE THE TABLES OF THE LAW OF PAIN
AND IN THEIR PLACE GREW LUMINOUS CHARACTERS
THE SKILFUL PENMAN'S UNSEEN FINGER WROTE
HIS SWIFT INTUITIVE CALLIGRAPHY
EARTH'S FORMS WERE MADE HIS DIVINE DOCUMENTS
THE WISDOM EMBODIED MIND COULD NOT REVEAL
INCONSCIENCE CHASED FROM THE WORLD'S VOICELESS BREAST
TRANSFIGURED WERE THE FIXED SCHEMES OF REASONING THOUGHT
AROUSING CONSCIOUSNESS IN THINGS INERT
HE IMPOSED UPON DARK ATOM AND DUMB MASS
THE DIAMOND SCRIPT OF THE IMPERISHABLE
INSCRIBED ON THE DIM HEART OF FALLEN THINGS
A PAEAN-SONG OF THE FREE INFINITE
AND THE NAME FOUNDATION OF ETERNITY
AND TRACED ON THE AWAKE EXULTANT CELLS
IN THE IDEOGRAPHS OF THE INEFFABLE
THE LYRIC OF THE LOVE THAT WAITS THROUGH TIME
AND THE MYSTIC VOLUME OF THE BOOK OF BLISS
AND THE MESSAGE OF THE SUPERCONSCIENT FIRE
THEN LIFE BEAT PURE IN THE CORPOREAL FRAME
THE INFERNAL GLEAM DIED AND COULD SLAY NO MORE
HELL SPLIT ACROSS ITS HUGE ABRUPT FACADE
AS IF A MAGIC BUILDING WERE UNDONE
NIGHT OPENED AND VANISHED LIKE A GULF OF DREAM
INTO BEING'S GAP SCOOPED OUT AS EMPTY SPACE
IN WHICH SHE HAD FILLED THE PLACE OF ABSENT GOD
THERE POURED A WIDE INTIMATE AND BLISSFUL DAWN
HEALED WERE ALL THINGS THAT TIME'S TORN HEART HAD MADE
AND SORROW COULD LIVE NO MORE IN NATURE'S BREAST
DIVISION CEASED TO BE FOR GOD WAS THERE
THE SOUL LIT THE CONSCIOUS BODY WITH ITS RAY
MATTER AND SPIRIT MINGLED AND WERE ONE
233
AROUND HIM SHONE A GREAT FELICITOUS DAY
A LUSTRE OF SOME RAPTUROUS INFINITE
IT HELD IN THE SPLENDOUR OF ITS GOLDEN LAUGH
REGIONS OF THE HEART'S HAPPINESS SET FREE
INTOXICATED WITH THE WINE OF GOD
IMMERSED IN LIGHT PERPETUALLY DIVINE
A FAVOURITE AND INTIMATE OF THE GODS
OBEYING THE DIVINE COMMAND TO JOY
IT WAS THE SOVEREIGN OF ITS OWN DELIGHT
AND MASTER OF THE KINGDOMS OF ITS FORCE
ASSURED OF THE BLISS FOR WHICH ALL FORMS WERE MADE
UNMOVED BY FEAR AND GRIEF AND THE SHOCKS OF FATE
AND UNALARMED BY THE BREATH OF FLEETING TIME
AND UNBESIEGED BY ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCE
IT BREATHED IN A SWEET SECURE UNGUARDED EASE
FREE FROM OUR BODY'S FRAILTY INVITING DEATH
FAR FROM OUR DANGER-ZONE OF STUMBLING WILL
IT NEEDED NOT TO CURB ITS PASSIONATE BEATS
THRILLED BY THE CLASP OF THE WARM SATISFIED SENSE
AND THE SWIFT WONDER-RUSH AND FLAME AND CRY
OF THE LIFE-IMPULSES' RED MAGNIFICENT RACE
IT LIVED IN A JEWEL-RHYTHM OF THE LAUGHTER OF GOD
AND LAY ON THE BREAST OF UNIVERSAL LOVE
IMMUNE THE UNFETTERED SPIRIT OF DELIGHT
PASTURED HIS GLEAMING SUN-HERDS AND MOON-FLOCKS
ALONG THE LYRIC SPEED OF GRIEFLESS STREAMS
IN FRAGRANCE OF THE UNEARTHLY ASPHODEL
A SILENCE OF FELICITY WRAPPED THE HEAVENS
A CARELESS RADIANCE SMILED UPON THE HEIGHTS
A MURMUR OF INARTICULATE RAVISHMENT
TREMBLED IN THE WINDS AND TOUCHED THE ENCHANTED SOIL
234
INCESSANT IN THE ARMS OF ECSTASY
REPEATING ITS SWEET INVOLUNTARY NOTE
A SOB OF RAPTURE FLOWED ALONG THE HOURS
ADVANCING UNDER AN ARCH OF GLORY AND PEACE
TRAVELLER ON PLATEAU AND ON MUSING RIDGE
AS ONE WHO SEES IN THE WORLD-MAGICIAN'S GLASS
A MIRACLED IMAGERY OF SOUL-SCAPES FLEE
HE TRAVERSED SCENES OF AN IMMORTAL JOY
AND GAZED INTO ABYSMS OF BEAUTY AND BLISS
AROUND HIM WAS A LIGHT OF CONSCIOUS SUNS
AND A BROODING GLADNESS OF GREAT SYMBOL THINGS
TO MEET HIM CROWDED PLAINS OF BRILLIANT CALM
MOUNTAINS AND VIOLET VALLEYS OF THE BLEST
DEEP GLENS OF JOY AND CROONING WATERFALLS
AND WOODS OF QUIVERING PURPLE SOLITUDE
BELOW HIM LAY LIKE GLEAMING JEWELLED THOUGHTS
RAPT DREAMING CITIES OF GANDHARVA KINGS
ACROSS THE VIBRANT SECRECIES OF SPACE
A DIM AND HAPPY MUSIC SWEETLY STOLE
SMITTEN BY UNSEEN HANDS HE HEARD HEART-CLOSE
THE HARPS' CRY OF THE HEAVENLY MINSTRELS PASS
AND VOICES OF UNEARTHLY MELODY
CHANTED THE GLORY OF ETERNAL LOVE
IN THE WHITE-BLUE-MOONBEAM AIR OF PARADISE
A SUMMIT AND CORE OF ALL THAT MARVELLOUS WORLD
APART STOOD HIGH ELYSIAN NAMELESS HILLS
BURNING LIKE SUNSETS IN A TRANCE OF EVE
AS IF TO SOME NEW UNSEARCHED PROFUNDITY
INTO A JOYFUL STILLNESS PLUNGED THEIR BASE
THEIR SLOPES THROUGH A HURRY OF LAUGHTER AND VOICES SANK
CROSSED BY A THRONG OF SINGING RIVULETS
ADORING BLUE HEAVEN WITH THEIR HAPPY HYMN
DOWN INTO WOODS OF SHADOWY SECRECY
LIFTED INTO WIDE VOICELESS MYSTERY
THEIR PEAKS CLIMBED TOWARDS A GREATNESS BEYOND LIFE
THE SHINING EDENS OF THE VITAL GODS
235
RECEIVED HIM IN THEIR DEATHLESS HARMONIES
ALL THINGS WERE PERFECT THERE THAT FLOWER IN TIME
BEAUTY WAS THERE CREATION'S NATIVE MOULD
PEACE WAS A THRILLED VOLUPTUOUS PURITY
THERE LOVE FULFILLED HER GOLD AND ROSEATE DREAMS
AND STRENGTH HER CROWNED AND MIGHTY REVERIES
DESIRE CLIMBED UP A SWIFT OMNIPOTENT FLAME
AND PLEASURE HAD THE STATURE OF THE GODS
DREAM WALKED ALONG THE HIGHWAYS OF THE STARS
SWEET COMMON THINGS TURNED INTO MIRACLES
OVERTAKEN BY THE SPIRIT'S SUDDEN SPELL
SMITTEN BY A DIVINE PASSION'S ALCHEMY
PAIN'S SELF COMPELLED TRANSFORMED TO POTENT JOY
CURING THE ANTITHESIS TWIXT HEAVEN AND HELL
ALL LIFE'S HIGH VISIONS ARE EMBODIED THERE
HER WANDERING HOPES ACHIEVED HER AUREATE COMBS
CAUGHT BY THE HONEY-EATER'S DARTING TONGUE
HER BURNING GUESSES CHANGED TO ECSTASIED TRUTHS
HER MIGHTY PANTINGS STILLED IN DEATHLESS CALM
AND LIBERATED HER IMMENSE DESIRES
IN THAT PARADISE OF PERFECT HEART AND SENSE
NO LOWER NOTE COULD BREAK THE ENDLESS CHARM
OF HER SWEETNESS ARDENT AND IMMACULATE
HER STEPS ARE SURE OF THEIR INTUITIVE FALL
AFTER THE ANGUISH OF THE SOUL'S LONG STRIFE
AT LENGTH WERE FOUND CALM AND CELESTIAL REST
AND LAPPED IN A MAGIC FLOOD OF SORROWLESS HOURS
HEALED WERE HIS WARRIOR NATURE'S WOUNDED LIMBS
IN THE ENCIRCLING ARMS OF ENERGIES
THAT BROOKED NO STAIN AND FEARED NOT THEIR OWN BLISS
IN SCENES FORBIDDEN TO OUR PALLID SENSE
AMID MIRACULOUS SCENTS AND WONDER-HUES
HE MET THE FORMS THAT DIVINISE THE SIGHT
TO MUSIC THAT CAN IMMORTALISE THE MIND
AND MAKE THE HEART WIDE AS INFINITY
LISTENED AND CAPTURED THE INAUDIBLE

CADENCES THAT AWAKE THE OCCULT EAR
OUT OF THE INEFFABLE HUSH IT HEARS THEM COME
TREMBLING WITH THE BEAUTY OF A WORDLESS SPEECH
AND THOUGHTS TOO GREAT AND DEEP TO FIND A VOICE
THOUGHTS WHOSE DESIRE NEW-MAKES THE UNIVERSE
A SCALE OF SENSE THAT CLIMBED WITH FIERY FEET
TO HEIGHTS OF UNIMAGINED HAPPINESS
RECAST HIS BEING'S AURA IN JOY-GLOW
HIS BODY GLIMMERED LIKE A SKIEY SHELL
HIS GATES TO THE WORLD WERE SWEPT WITH SEAS OF LIGHT
HIS EARTH DOWERED WITH CELESTIAL COMPETENCE
HARBOURED A POWER THAT NEEDED NOW NO MORE
TO CROSS THE CLOSED CUSTOMS-LINE OF MIND AND FLESH
AND SMUGGLE GODHEAD INTO HUMANITY
IT SHRANK NO MORE FROM THE SUPREME DEMAND
OF AN UNTIRED CAPACITY FOR BLISS
A MIGHT THAT COULD EXPLORE ITS OWN INFINITE
AND BEAUTY AND PASSION AND THE DEPTHS' REPLY
NOR FEARED THE SWOON OF GLAD IDENTITY
WHERE SPIRIT AND FLESH IN INNER ECSTASY JOIN
ANNULLING THE QUARREL BETWEEN SELF AND SHAPE
IT DREW FROM SIGHT AND SOUND SPIRITUAL POWER
MADE SENSE A ROAD TO REACH THE INTANGIBLE
IT THRILLED WITH THE SUPERNAL INFLUENCES
THAT BUILD THE SUBSTANCE OF LIFE'S DEEPER SOUL
EARTH-NATURE STOOD REBORN COMRADE OF HEAVEN
A FIT COMPANION OF THE TIMELESS KINGS
EQUALLED WITH THE GODHEADS OF THE LIVING SUNS
HE MIXED IN THE RADIANT PASTIMES OF THE UNBORN
HEARD WHISPERS OF THE PLAYER NEVER SEEN
AND LISTENED TO HIS VOICE THAT STEALS THE HEART
AND DRAWS IT TO THE BREAST OF GOD'S DESIRE
AND FELT ITS HONEY OF FELICITY
FLOW THROUGH HIS VEINS LIKE THE RIVERS OF PARADISE
MADE BODY A NECTAR-CUP OF THE ABSOLUTE
IN SUDDEN MOMENTS OF REVEALING FLAME
237
IN PASSIONATE RESPONSES HALF-UNVEILED
HE REACHED THE RIM OF ECSTASIES UNKNOWN
A TOUCH SUPREME SURPRISED HIS HURRYING HEART
THE CLASP WAS REMEMBERED OF THE WONDERFUL
AND HINTS LEAPED DOWN OF WHITE BEATITUDES
ETERNITY DREW CLOSE DISGUISED AS LOVE
AND LAID ITS HAND UPON THE BODY OF TIME
A LITTLE GIFT COMES FROM THE IMMENSITUDES
BUT MEASURELESS TO LIFE ITS GAIN OF JOY
ALL THE UNTOLD BEYOND IS MIRRORED THERE
A GIANT DROP OF THE BLISS UNKNOWABLE
OVERWHELMED HIS LIMBS AND ROUND HIS SOUL BECAME
A FIERY OCEAN OF FELICITY
HE FOUNDERED DROWNED IN SWEET AND BURNING VASTS
THE DIRE DELIGHT THAT COULD SHATTER MORTAL FLESH
THE RAPTURE THAT THE GODS SUSTAIN HE BORE
IMMORTAL PLEASURE CLEANSED HIM IN ITS WAVES
AND TURNED HIS STRENGTH INTO UNDYING POWER
IMMORTALITY CAPTURED TIME AND CARRIED LIFE
238
THIS TOO MUST NOW BE OVERPASSED AND LEFT
AS ALL MUST BE UNTIL THE HIGHEST IS GAINED
IN WHOM THE WORLD AND SELF GROW TRUE AND ONE
TILL THAT IS REACHED OUR JOURNEYING CANNOT CEASE
ALWAYS A NAMELESS GOAL BECKONS BEYOND
ALWAYS ASCENDS THE ZIGZAG OF THE GODS
AND UPWARD POINTS THE SPIRIT'S CLIMBING FIRE
THIS BREATH OF HUNDRED-HUED FELICITY
AND ITS PURE HEIGHTENED FIGURE OF TIME'S JOY
TOSSED UPON WAVES OF FLAWLESS HAPPINESS
HAMMERED INTO SINGLE BEATS OF ECSTASY
THIS FRACTION OF THE SPIRIT'S INTEGER
CAUGHT INTO A PASSIONATE GREATNESS OF EXTREMES
THIS LIMITED BEING LIFTED TO ZENITH BLISS
HAPPY TO ENJOY ONE TOUCH OF THINGS SUPREME
PACKED INTO ITS SEALED SMALL INFINITY
ITS ENDLESS TIME-MADE WORLD OUTFACING TIME
A LITTLE OUTPUT OF GOD'S VAST DELIGHT
THE MOMENTS STRETCHED TOWARDS THE ETERNAL NOW
THE HOURS DISCOVERED IMMORTALITY
BUT SATISFIED WITH THEIR SUBLIME CONTENTS
ON PEAKS THEY CEASED WHOSE TOPS HALF-WAY TO HEAVEN
POINTED TO AN APEX THEY COULD NEVER MOUNT
TO A GRANDEUR IN WHOSE AIR THEY COULD NOT LIVE
INVITING TO THEIR HIGH AND EXQUISITE SPHERE
TO THEIR SECURE AND FINE EXTREMITIES
THIS CREATURE WHO HUGS HIS LIMITS TO FEEL SAFE
THESE HEIGHTS DECLINED A GREATER ADVENTURE'S CALL
A GLORY AND SWEETNESS OF SATISFIED DESIRE
TIED UP THE SPIRIT TO GOLDEN POSTS OF BLISS
IT COULD NOT HOUSE THE WIDENESS OF A SOUL
239
WHICH NEEDED ALL INFINITY FOR ITS HOME
A MEMORY SOFT AS GRASS AND FAINT AS SLEEP
THE BEAUTY AND CALL RECEDING SANK BEHIND
LIKE A SWEET SONG HEARD FADING FAR AWAY
UPON THE LONG HIGH ROAD TO TIMELESSNESS
ABOVE WAS AN ARDENT WHITE TRANQUILLITY
A MUSING SPIRIT LOOKED OUT ON THE WORLDS
AND LIKE A BRILLIANT CLAMBERING OF SKIES
PASSING THROUGH CLARITY TO AN UNSEEN LIGHT
LARGE LUCENT REALMS OF MIND FROM STILLNESS SHONE
BUT FIRST HE MET A SILVER-GREY EXPANSE
WHERE DAY AND NIGHT HAD WEDDED AND WERE ONE
IT WAS A TRACT OF DIM AND SHIFTING RAYS
PARTING LIFE'S SENTIENT FLOW FROM THOUGHT'S SELF-POISE
A COALITION OF UNCERTAINTIES
THERE EXERCISED UNEASY GOVERNMENT
ON A GROUND RESERVED FOR DOUBT AND REASONED GUESS
A RENDEZVOUS OF KNOWLEDGE WITH IGNORANCE
AT ITS LOW EXTREMITY HELD DIFFICULT SWAY
A MIND THAT HARDLY SAW AND SLOWLY FOUND
ITS NATURE TO OUR EARTHLY NATURE CLOSE
AND KIN TO OUR PRECARIOUS MORTAL THOUGHT
THAT LOOKS FROM SOIL TO SKY AND SKY TO SOIL
BUT KNOWS NOT THE BELOW NOR THE BEYOND
IT ONLY SENSED ITSELF AND OUTWARD THINGS
THIS WAS THE FIRST MEANS OF OUR SLOW ASCENT
FROM THE HALF-CONSCIENCE OF THE ANIMAL SOUL
LIVING IN A CROWDED PRESS OF SHAPE-EVENTS
IN A REALM IT CANNOT UNDERSTAND NOR CHANGE
ONLY IT SEES AND ACTS IN A GIVEN SCENE
AND FEELS AND JOYS AND SORROWS FOR A WHILE
THE IDEAS THAT DRIVE THE OBSCURE EMBODIED SPIRIT
ALONG THE ROADS OF SUFFERING AND DESIRE
IN A WORLD THAT STRUGGLES TO DISCOVER TRUTH
FOUND HERE THEIR POWER TO BE AND NATURE-FORCE
HERE ARE DEVISED THE FORMS OF AN IGNORANT LIFE
240
THAT SEES THE EMPIRIC FACT AS SETTLED LAW
LABOURS FOR THE HOUR AND NOT FOR ETERNITY
AND TRADES ITS GAINS TO MEET THE MOMENT'S CALL
THE SLOW PROCESS OF A MATERIAL MIND
WHICH SERVES THE BODY IT SHOULD RULE AND USE
AND NEEDS TO LEAN UPON AN ERRING SENSE
WAS BORN IN THAT LUMINOUS OBSCURITY
ADVANCING TARDILY FROM A LIMPING START
CRUTCHING HYPOTHESIS ON ARGUMENT
THRONING ITS THEORIES AS CERTITUDES
IT REASONS FROM THE HALF-KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN
EVER CONSTRUCTING ITS FRAIL HOUSE OF THOUGHT
EVER UNDOING THE WEB THAT IT HAS SPUN
A TWILIGHT SAGE WHOSE SHADOW SEEMS TO HIM SELF
MOVING FROM MINUTE TO BRIEF MINUTE LIVES
A KING DEPENDENT ON HIS SATELLITES
SIGNS THE DECREES OF IGNORANT MINISTERS
A JUDGE IN HALF-POSSESSION OF HIS PROOFS
A VOICE CLAMANT OF UNCERTAINTY'S POSTULATES
AN ARCHITECT OF KNOWLEDGE NOT ITS SOURCE
THIS POWERFUL BONDSLAVE OF HIS INSTRUMENTS
THINKS HIS LOW STATION NATURE'S HIGHEST TOP
OBLIVIOUS OF HIS SHARE IN ALL THINGS MADE
AND HAUGHTILY HUMBLE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
BELIEVES HIMSELF A SPAWN OF MATTER'S MUD
AND TAKES HIS OWN CREATIONS FOR HIS CAUSE
TO ETERNAL LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO RISE
UP FROM MAN'S BARE BEGINNING IS OUR CLIMB
OUT OF EARTH'S HEAVY SMALLNESS WE MUST BREAK
WE MUST SEARCH OUR NATURE WITH SPIRITUAL FIRE
AN INSECT CRAWL PRELUDES OUR GLORIOUS FLIGHT
OUR HUMAN STATE CRADLES THE FUTURE GOD
OUR MORTAL FRAILTY AN IMMORTAL FORCE
AT THE GLOW-WORM TOP OF THESE PALE GLIMMER-REALMS
WHERE DAWN-SHEEN GAMBOLLED WITH THE NATIVE DUSK
AND HELPED THE DAY TO GROW AND NIGHT TO FAIL
241
ESCAPING OVER A WIDE AND SHIMMERING BRIDGE
HE CAME INTO A REALM OF EARLY LIGHT
AND THE REGENCY OF A HALF-RISEN SUN
OUT OF ITS RAYS OUR MIND'S FULL ORB WAS BORN
APPOINTED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLDS
TO MEDIATE WITH THE UNKNOWING DEPTHS
A PROTOTYPAL DEFT INTELLIGENCE
HALF-POISED ON EQUAL WINGS OF THOUGHT AND DOUBT
TOILED CEASELESSLY TWIXT BEING'S HIDDEN ENDS
A SECRECY BREATHED IN LIFE'S MOVING ACT
A COVERT NURSE OF NATURE'S MIRACLES
IT SHAPED LIFE'S WONDERS OUT OF MATTER'S MUD
IT CUT THE PATTERN OF THE SHAPES OF THINGS
IT PITCHED MIND'S TENT IN THE VAGUE IGNORANT VAST
A MASTER MAGICIAN OF MEASURE AND DEVICE
HAS MADE AN ETERNITY FROM RECURRING FORMS
AND TO THE WANDERING SPECTATOR THOUGHT
ASSIGNED A SEAT ON THE INCONSCIENT STAGE
ON EARTH BY THE WILL OF THIS ARCH-INTELLIGENCE
A BODILESS ENERGY PUT ON MATTER'S ROBE
PROTON AND PHOTON SERVED THE IMAGER EYE
TO CHANGE THINGS SUBTLE INTO A PHYSICAL WORLD
AND THE INVISIBLE APPEARED AS SHAPE
AND THE IMPALPABLE WAS FELT AS MASS
MAGIC OF PERCEPT JOINED WITH CONCEPT'S ART
AND LENT TO EACH OBJECT AN INTERPRETING NAME
IDEA WAS DISGUISED IN A BODY'S ARTISTRY
AND BY A STRANGE ATOMIC LAW'S MYSTIQUE
A FRAME WAS MADE IN WHICH THE SENSE COULD PUT
ITS SYMBOL PICTURE OF THE UNIVERSE
EVEN A GREATER MIRACLE WAS DONE
THE MEDIATING LIGHT LINKED BODY'S POWER
THE SLEEP AND DREAMING OF THE TREE AND PLANT
THE ANIMAL'S VIBRANT SENSE THE THOUGHT IN MAN
TO THE EFFULGENCE OF A RAY ABOVE
ITS SKILL ENDORSING MATTER'S RIGHT TO THINK
242
CUT SENTIENT PASSAGES FOR THE MIND OF FLESH
AND FOUND A MEANS FOR NESCIENCE TO KNOW
OFFERING ITS LITTLE SQUARES AND CUBES OF WORD
AS FIGURED SUBSTITUTES FOR REALITY
A MUMMIFIED MNEMONIC ALPHABET
IT HELPED THE UNSEEING FORCE TO READ HER WORKS
A BURIED CONSCIOUSNESS AROSE IN HER
AND NOW SHE DREAMS HERSELF HUMAN AND AWAKE
BUT ALL WAS STILL A MOBILE IGNORANCE
STILL KNOWLEDGE COULD NOT COME AND FIRMLY GRASP
THIS HUGE INVENTION SEEN AS A UNIVERSE
A SPECIALIST OF LOGIC'S HARD MACHINE
IMPOSED ITS RIGID ARTIFICE ON THE SOUL
AN AIDE OF THE INVENTOR INTELLECT
IT CUT TRUTH INTO MANAGEABLE BITS
THAT EACH MIGHT HAVE HIS RATION OF THOUGHT-FOOD
THEN NEW-BUILT TRUTH'S SLAIN BODY BY ITS ART
A ROBOT EXACT AND SERVICEABLE AND FALSE
DISPLACED THE SPIRIT'S FINER VIEW OF THINGS
A POLISHED ENGINE DID THE WORK OF A GOD
NONE THE TRUE BODY FOUND ITS SOUL SEEMED DEAD
NONE HAD THE INNER LOOK WHICH SEES TRUTH'S WHOLE
ALL GLORIFIED THE GLITTERING SUBSTITUTE
THEN FROM THE SECRET HEIGHTS A WAVE SWEPT DOWN
A BRILLIANT CHAOS OF REBEL LIGHT AROSE
IT LOOKED ABOVE AND SAW THE DAZZLING PEAKS
IT LOOKED WITHIN AND WOKE THE SLEEPING GOD
IMAGINATION CALLED HER SHINING SQUADS
THAT VENTURE INTO UNDISCOVERED SCENES
WHERE ALL THE MARVELS LURK NONE YET HAS KNOWN
LIFTING HER BEAUTIFUL AND MIRACULOUS HEAD
SHE CONSPIRED WITH INSPIRATION'S SISTER BROOD
TO FILL THOUGHT'S SKIES WITH GLIMMERING NEBULAE
A BRIGHT ERROR FRINGED THE MYSTERY-ALTAR'S FRIEZE
DARKNESS GREW NURSE TO WISDOM'S OCCULT SUN
MYTH SUCKLED KNOWLEDGE WITH HER LUSTROUS MILK
243
THE INFANT PASSED FROM DIM TO RADIANT BREASTS
THUS WORKED THE POWER UPON THE GROWING WORLD
ITS SUBTLE CRAFT WITHHELD THE FULL-ORBED BLAZE
CHERISHED THE SOUL'S CHILDHOOD AND ON FICTIONS FED
FAR RICHER IN THEIR SWEET AND NECTAROUS SAP
NOURISHING ITS IMMATURE DIVINITY
THAN THE STAPLE OR DRY STRAW OF REASON'S TILTH
ITS HEAPED FODDER OF INNUMERABLE FACTS
PLEBEIAN FARE ON WHICH TODAY WE THRIVE
THUS STREAMED DOWN FROM THE REALM OF EARLY LIGHT
ETHEREAL THINKINGS INTO MATTER'S WORLD
ITS GOLD-HORNED HERDS TROOPED INTO EARTH'S CAVE-HEART
ITS MORNING RAYS ILLUME OUR TWILIGHT'S EYES
ITS YOUNG FORMATIONS MOVE THE MIND OF EARTH
TO LABOUR AND TO DREAM AND NEW-CREATE
TO FEEL BEAUTY'S TOUCH AND KNOW THE WORLD AND SELF
THE GOLDEN CHILD BEGAN TO THINK AND SEE
IN THOSE BRIGHT REALMS ARE MIND'S FIRST FORWARD STEPS
IGNORANT OF ALL BUT EAGER TO KNOW ALL
ITS CURIOUS SLOW ENQUIRY THERE BEGINS
EVER ITS SEARCHING GRASPS AT SHAPES AROUND
EVER IT HOPES TO FIND OUT GREATER THINGS
ARDENT AND GOLDEN-GLEAMED WITH SUNRISE FIRES
ALERT IT LIVES UPON INVENTION'S VERGE
YET ALL IT DOES IS ON AN INFANT'S SCALE
AS IF THE COSMOS WERE A NURSERY GAME
MIND LIFE THE PLAYTHINGS OF A TITAN'S BABE
AS ONE IT WORKS WHO BUILDS A MIMIC FORT
MIRACULOUSLY STABLE FOR A WHILE
MADE OF THE SANDS UPON A BANK OF TIME
MID AN OCCULT ETERNITY'S SHORELESS SEA
A SMALL KEEN INSTRUMENT THE GREAT PUISSANCE CHOSE
AN ARDUOUS PASTIME PASSIONATELY PURSUES
TO TEACH THE IGNORANCE IS HER DIFFICULT CHARGE
HER THOUGHT STARTS FROM AN ORIGINAL NESCIENT VOID
244
AND WHAT SHE TEACHES SHE HERSELF MUST LEARN
AROUSING KNOWLEDGE FROM ITS SLEEPY LAIR
FOR KNOWLEDGE COMES NOT TO US AS A GUEST
CALLED INTO OUR CHAMBER FROM THE OUTER WORLD
A FRIEND AND INMATE OF OUR SECRET SELF
IT HID BEHIND OUR MINDS AND FELL ASLEEP
AND SLOWLY WAKES BENEATH THE BLOWS OF LIFE
THE MIGHTY DAEMON LIES UNSHAPED WITHIN
TO EVOKE TO GIVE IT FORM IS NATURE'S TASK
ALL WAS A CHAOS OF THE TRUE AND FALSE
MIND SOUGHT AMID DEEP MISTS OF NESCIENCE
IT LOOKED WITHIN ITSELF BUT SAW NOT GOD
A MATERIAL INTERIM DIPLOMACY
DENIED THE TRUTH THAT TRANSIENT TRUTHS MIGHT LIVE
AND HID THE DEITY IN CREED AND GUESS
THAT THE WORLD-IGNORANCE MIGHT GROW SLOWLY WISE
THIS WAS THE IMBROGLIO MADE BY SOVEREIGN MIND
LOOKING FROM A GLEAM-RIDGE INTO THE NIGHT
IN HER FIRST TAMPERINGS WITH INCONSCIENCE
ITS ALIEN DUSK BAFFLES HER LUMINOUS EYES
HER RAPID HANDS MUST LEARN A CAUTIOUS ZEAL
ONLY A SLOW ADVANCE THE EARTH CAN BEAR
YET WAS HER STRENGTH UNLIKE THE UNSEEING EARTH'S
COMPELLED TO HANDLE MAKESHIFT INSTRUMENTS
INVENTED BY THE LIFE-FORCE AND THE FLESH
EARTH ALL PERCEIVES THROUGH DOUBTFUL IMAGES
ALL SHE CONCEIVES IN HAZARDOUS JETS OF SIGHT
SMALL LIGHTS KINDLED BY TOUCHES OF GROPING THOUGHT
INCAPABLE OF THE SOUL'S DIRECT INLOOK
SHE SEES BY SPASMS AND SOLDERS KNOWLEDGE-SCRAP
MAKES TRUTH THE SLAVE-GIRL OF HER INDIGENCE
EXPELLING NATURE'S MYSTIC UNITY
CUTS INTO QUANTUM AND MASS THE MOVING ALL
SHE TAKES FOR MEASURING-ROD HER IGNORANCE
IN HER OWN DOMAIN A PONTIFF AND A SEER
THAT GREATER POWER WITH HER HALF-RISEN SUN
245
WROUGHT WITHIN LIMITS BUT POSSESSED HER FIELD
SHE KNEW BY A PRIVILEGE OF THINKING FORCE
AND CLAIMED AN INFANT SOVEREIGNTY OF SIGHT
IN HER EYES HOWEVER DARKLY FRINGED WAS LIT
THE ARCHANGEL'S GAZE WHO KNOWS INSPIRED HIS ACTS
AND SHAPES A WORLD IN ITS FAR-SEEING FLAME
IN HER OWN REALM SHE STUMBLES NOT NOR FAILS
BUT MOVES IN BOUNDARIES OF SUBTLE POWER
ACROSS WHICH MIND CAN STEP TOWARDS THE SUN
A CANDIDATE FOR A HIGHER SUZERAINTY
A PASSAGE SHE CUT THROUGH FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT
AND SEARCHED FOR AN UNGRASPED OMNISCIENCE
A DWARF THREE-BODIED TRINITY WAS HER SERF
FIRST SMALLEST OF THE THREE BUT STRONG OF LIMB
A LOW-BROW WITH A SQUARE AND HEAVY JOWL
A PIGMY THOUGHT NEEDING TO LIVE IN BOUNDS
FOR EVER STOOPED TO HAMMER FACT AND FORM
ABSORBED AND CABINED IN EXTERNAL SIGHT
IT TAKES ITS STAND ON NATURE'S SOLID BASE
A TECHNICIAN ADMIRABLE A THINKER CRUDE
A RIVETER OF LIFE TO HABIT'S GROOVES
OBEDIENT TO GROSS MATTER'S TYRANNY
A PRISONER OF THE MOULDS IN WHICH IT WORKS
IT BINDS ITSELF BY WHAT ITSELF CREATES
A SLAVE OF A FIXED MASS OF ABSOLUTE RULES
IT SEES AS LAW THE HABITS OF THE WORLD
IT SEES AS TRUTH THE HABITS OF THE MIND
IN ITS REALM OF CONCRETE IMAGES AND EVENTS
TURNING IN A WORN CIRCLE OF IDEAS
AND EVER REPEATING OLD FAMILIAR ACTS
IT LIVES CONTENT WITH THE COMMON AND THE KNOWN
IT LOVES THE OLD GROUND THAT WAS ITS DWELLING-PLACE
ABHORRING CHANGE AS AN AUDACIOUS SIN
DISTRUSTFUL OF EACH NEW DISCOVERY
ONLY IT ADVANCES STEP BY CAREFUL STEP
246
AND FEARS AS IF A DEADLY ABYSS THE UNKNOWN
A PRUDENT TREASURER OF ITS IGNORANCE
IT SHRINKS FROM ADVENTURE BLINKS AT GLORIOUS HOPE
PREFERRING A SAFE FOOTHOLD UPON THINGS
TO THE DANGEROUS JOY OF WIDENESS AND OF HEIGHT
THE WORLD'S SLOW IMPRESSIONS ON ITS LABOURING MIND
TARDY IMPRINTS ALMOST INDELIBLE
INCREASE THEIR VALUE BY THEIR POVERTY
THE OLD SURE MEMORIES ARE ITS CAPITAL STOCK
ONLY WHAT SENSE CAN GRASP SEEMS ABSOLUTE
EXTERNAL FACT IT FIGURES AS SOLE TRUTH
WISDOM IDENTIFIES WITH THE EARTHWARD LOOK
AND THINGS LONG KNOWN AND ACTIONS ALWAYS DONE
ARE TO ITS CLINGING HOLD A BALUSTRADE
OF SAFETY ON THE PERILOUS STAIR OF TIME
HEAVEN'S TRUST TO IT ARE THE ESTABLISHED ANCIENT WAYS
IMMUTABLE LAWS MAN HAS NO RIGHT TO CHANGE
A SACRED LEGACY FROM THE GREAT DEAD PAST
OR THE ONE ROAD THAT GOD HAS MADE FOR LIFE
A FIRM SHAPE OF NATURE NEVER TO BE CHANGED
PART OF THE HUGE ROUTINE OF THE UNIVERSE
A SMILE FROM THE PRESERVER OF THE WORLDS
SENT DOWN OF OLD THIS GUARDIAN MIND TO EARTH
THAT ALL MIGHT STAND IN THEIR FIXED CHANGELESS TYPE
AND FROM THEIR SECULAR POSTURE NEVER MOVE
ONE SEES IT CIRCLING FAITHFUL TO ITS TASK
TIRELESS IN AN ASSIGNED TRADITION'S ROUND
IN DECAYED AND CRUMBLING OFFICES OF TIME
IT KEEPS CLOSE GUARD IN FRONT OF CUSTOM'S WALL
OR IN AN ANCIENT NIGHT'S DIM ENVIRONS
IT DOZES ON A LITTLE COURTYARD'S STONES
AND BARKS AT EVERY UNFAMILIAR LIGHT
AS AT A FOE WHO WOULD BREAK UP ITS HOME
A WATCH-DOG OF THE SPIRIT'S SENSE-RAILED HOUSE
AGAINST INTRUDERS FROM THE INVISIBLE
NOURISHED ON SCRAPS OF LIFE AND MATTER'S BONES
247
IN ITS KENNEL OF OBJECTIVE CERTITUDE
AND YET BEHIND IT STANDS A COSMIC MIGHT
A MEASURED GREATNESS KEEPS ITS VASTER PLAN
A FATHOMLESS SAMENESS RHYTHMS THE TREAD OF LIFE
THE STARS' CHANGELESS ORBITS FURROW INERT SPACE
A MILLION SPECIES FOLLOW ONE MUTE LAW
A HUGE INERTNESS IS THE WORLD'S DEFENCE
EVEN IN CHANGE IS TREASURED CHANGELESSNESS
INTO INERTIA REVOLUTION SINKS
IN A NEW DRESS THE OLD RESUMES ITS ROLE
THE ENERGY ACTS THE STABLE IS ITS SEAL
ON SHIVA'S BREAST IS STAYED THE ENORMOUS DANCE
A FIERY SPIRIT CAME NEXT OF THE THREE
A HUNCHBACK RIDER OF THE RED WILD-ASS
A RASH INTELLIGENCE LEAPED DOWN LION-MANED
FROM THE GREAT MYSTIC FLAME THAT RINGS THE WORLDS
AND WITH ITS DIRE EDGE EATS AT BEING'S HEART
THENCE SPRANG THE BURNING VISION OF DESIRE
A THOUSAND SHAPES IT WORE TOOK NUMBERLESS NAMES
A NEED OF MULTITUDE AND UNCERTAINTY
PRICKS IT FOR EVER TO PURSUE THE ONE
ON COUNTLESS ROADS ACROSS THE VASTS OF TIME
THROUGH CIRCUITS OF UNENDING DIFFERENCE
IT BURNS ALL BREASTS WITH AN AMBIGUOUS FIRE
A RADIANCE GLEAMING ON A MURKY STREAM
IT FLAMED TOWARDS HEAVEN THEN SANK ENGULFED TOWARDS HELL
IT CLIMBED TO DRAG DOWN TRUTH INTO THE MIRE
AND USED FOR MUDDY ENDS ITS BRILLIANT FORCE
A HUGE CHAMELEON GOLD AND BLUE AND RED
TURNING TO BLACK AND GREY AND LURID BROWN
HUNGRY IT STARED FROM A MOTTLED BOUGH OF LIFE
TO SNAP UP INSECT JOYS ITS FAVOURITE FOOD
THE DINGY SUSTENANCE OF A SUMPTUOUS FRAME
NURSING THE SPLENDID PASSION OF ITS HUES
A SNAKE OF FLAME WITH A DULL CLOUD FOR TAIL
FOLLOWED BY A DREAM-BROOD OF GLITTERING THOUGHTS
248
A LIFTED HEAD WITH MANY-TINGED FLICKERING CRESTS
IT LICKED AT KNOWLEDGE WITH A SMOKY TONGUE
A WHIRLPOOL SUCKING IN AN EMPTY AIR
IT BASED ON VACANCY STUPENDOUS CLAIMS
IN NOTHINGNESS BORN TO NOTHINGNESS RETURNED
YET ALL THE TIME UNWITTINGLY IT DROVE
TOWARDS THE HIDDEN SOMETHING THAT IS ALL
ARDENT TO FIND INCAPABLE TO RETAIN
A BRILLIANT INSTABILITY WAS ITS MARK
TO ERR ITS INBORN TREND ITS NATIVE CUE
AT ONCE TO AN UNREFLECTING CREDENCE PRONE
IT THOUGHT ALL TRUE THAT FLATTERED ITS OWN HOPES
IT CHERISHED GOLDEN NOTHINGS BORN OF WISH
IT SNATCHED AT THE UNREAL FOR PROVENDER
IN DARKNESS IT DISCOVERED LUMINOUS SHAPES
PEERING INTO A SHADOW-HUNG HALF-LIGHT
IT SAW HUED IMAGES SCRAWLED ON FANCY'S CAVE
OR IT SWEPT IN CIRCLES THROUGH CONJECTURE'S NIGHT
AND CAUGHT IN IMAGINATION'S CAMERA
BRIGHT SCENES OF PROMISE HELD BY TRANSIENT FLARES
FIXED IN LIFE'S AIR THE FEET OF HURRYING DREAMS
KEPT PRINTS OF PASSING FORMS AND HOODED POWERS
AND FLASH-IMAGES OF HALF-SEEN VERITIES
AN EAGER SPRING TO SEIZE AND TO POSSESS
UNGUIDED BY REASON OR THE SEEING SOUL
WAS ITS FIRST NATURAL MOTION AND ITS LAST
IT SQUANDERED LIFE'S FORCE TO ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE
IT SCORNED THE STRAIGHT ROAD AND RAN ON WANDERING CURVES
AND LEFT WHAT IT HAD WON FOR UNTRIED THINGS
IT SAW UNREALISED AIMS AS INSTANT FATE
AND CHOSE THE PRECIPICE FOR ITS LEAP TO HEAVEN
ADVENTURE ITS SYSTEM IN THE GAMBLE OF LIFE
IT TOOK FORTUITOUS GAINS AS SAFE RESULTS
ERROR DISCOURAGED NOT ITS CONFIDENT VIEW
IGNORANT OF THE DEEP LAW OF BEING'S WAYS
AND FAILURE COULD NOT SLOW ITS FIERY CLUTCH
249
ONE CHANCE MADE TRUE WARRANTED ALL THE REST
ATTEMPT NOT VICTORY WAS THE CHARM OF LIFE
AN UNCERTAIN WINNER OF UNCERTAIN STAKES
INSTINCT ITS DAM AND THE LIFE-MIND ITS SIRE
IT RAN ITS RACE AND CAME IN FIRST OR LAST
YET WERE ITS WORKS NOR SMALL AND VAIN NOR NULL
IT NURSED A PORTION OF INFINITY'S STRENGTH
AND COULD CREATE THE HIGH THINGS ITS FANCY WILLED
ITS PASSION CAUGHT WHAT CALM INTELLIGENCE MISSED
INSIGHT OF IMPULSE LAID ITS LEAPING GRASP
ON HEAVENS HIGH THOUGHT HAD HIDDEN IN DAZZLING MIST
CAUGHT GLIMMERS THAT REVEALED A LURKING SUN
IT PROBED THE VOID AND FOUND A TREASURE THERE
A HALF-INTUITION PURPLED IN ITS SENSE
IT THREW THE LIGHTNING'S FORK AND HIT THE UNSEEN
IT SAW IN THE DARK AND VAGUELY BLINKED IN THE LIGHT
IGNORANCE WAS ITS FIELD THE UNKNOWN ITS PRIZE
OF ALL THESE POWERS THE GREATEST WAS THE LAST
ARRIVING LATE FROM A FAR PLANE OF THOUGHT
INTO A PACKED IRRATIONAL WORLD OF CHANCE
WHERE ALL WAS GROSSLY FELT AND BLINDLY DONE
YET THE HAPHAZARD SEEMED THE INEVITABLE
CAME REASON THE SQUAT GODHEAD ARTISAN
TO HER NARROW HOUSE UPON A RIDGE IN TIME
ADEPT OF CLEAR CONTRIVANCE AND DESIGN
A PENSIVE FACE AND CLOSE AND PEERING EYES
SHE TOOK HER FIRM AND IRREMOVABLE SEAT
THE STRONGEST WISEST OF THE TROLL-LIKE THREE
ARMED WITH HER LENS AND MEASURING-ROD AND PROBE
SHE LOOKED UPON AN OBJECT UNIVERSE
AND THE MULTITUDES THAT IN IT LIVE AND DIE
AND THE BODY OF SPACE AND THE FLEEING SOUL OF TIME
AND TOOK THE EARTH AND STARS INTO HER HANDS
TO TRY WHAT SHE COULD MAKE OF THESE STRANGE THINGS
IN HER STRONG PURPOSEFUL LABORIOUS MIND
INVENTING HER SCHEME-LINES OF REALITY
250
AND THE GEOMETRIC CURVES OF HER TIME-PLAN
SHE MULTIPLIED HER SLOW HALF-CUTS AT TRUTH
IMPATIENT OF ENIGMA AND THE UNKNOWN
INTOLERANT OF THE LAWLESS AND THE UNIQUE
IMPOSING REFLECTION ON THE MARCH OF FORCE
IMPOSING CLARITY ON THE UNFATHOMABLE
SHE STROVE TO REDUCE TO RULES THE MYSTIC WORLD
NOTHING SHE KNEW BUT ALL THINGS HOPED TO KNOW
IN DARK INCONSCIENT REALMS ONCE VOID OF THOUGHT
MISSIONED BY A SUPREME INTELLIGENCE
TO THROW ITS RAY UPON THE OBSCURE VAST
AN IMPERFECT LIGHT LEADING AN ERRING MASS
BY THE POWER OF SENSE AND THE IDEA AND WORD
SHE FERRETS OUT NATURE'S PROCESS SUBSTANCE CAUSE
ALL LIFE TO HARMONISE BY THOUGHT'S CONTROL
SHE WITH THE HUGE IMBROGLIO STRUGGLES STILL
IGNORANT OF ALL BUT HER OWN SEEKING MIND
TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM IGNORANCE SHE CAME
A SOVEREIGN WORKER THROUGH THE CENTURIES
OBSERVING AND REMOULDING ALL THAT IS
CONFIDENT SHE TOOK UP HER STUPENDOUS CHARGE
THERE THE LOW BENT AND MIGHTY FIGURE SITS
BOWED UNDER THE ARC-LAMPS OF HER FACTORY HOME
AMID THE CLATTER AND RINGING OF HER TOOLS
A RIGOROUS STARE IN HER CREATIVE EYES
COERCING THE PLASTIC STUFF OF COSMIC MIND
SHE SETS THE HARD INVENTIONS OF HER BRAIN
IN A PATTERN OF ETERNAL FIXITY
INDIFFERENT TO THE COSMIC DUMB DEMAND
UNCONSCIOUS OF TOO CLOSE REALITIES
OF THE UNSPOKEN THOUGHT THE VOICELESS HEART
SHE LEANS TO FORGE HER CREDOS AND IRON CODES
AND METAL STRUCTURES TO IMPRISON LIFE
AND MECHANIC MODELS OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE
FOR THE WORLD SEEN SHE WEAVES A WORLD CONCEIVED
SHE SPINS IN STIFF BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL LINES
251
HER GOSSAMER WORD-WEBS OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT
HER SEGMENT SYSTEMS OF THE INFINITE
HER THEODICIES AND COSMOGONIC CHARTS
AND MYTHS BY WHICH SHE EXPLAINS THE INEXPLICABLE
AT WILL SHE SPACES IN THIN AIR OF MIND
LIKE MAPS IN THE SCHOOL-HOUSE OF INTELLECT HUNG
FORCING WIDE TRUTH INTO A NARROW SCHEME
HER NUMBERLESS WARRING STRICT PHILOSOPHIES
OUT OF NATURE'S BODY OF PHENOMENON
SHE CARVES WITH THOUGHT'S KEEN EDGE IN RIGID LINES
LIKE RAILS FOR THE WORLD-MAGICIAN'S POWER TO RUN
HER SCIENCES PRECISE AND ABSOLUTE
ON THE HUGE BARE WALLS OF HUMAN NESCIENCE
WRITTEN ROUND NATURE'S DEEP DUMB HIEROGLYPHS
SHE PENS IN CLEAR DEMOTIC CHARACTERS
THE VAST ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF HER THOUGHTS
AN ALGEBRA OF HER MATHEMATICS' SIGNS
HER NUMBERS AND UNERRING FORMULAS
SHE BUILDS TO CLINCH HER SUMMARY OF THINGS
ON ALL SIDES RUNS AS IF IN A COSMIC MOSQUE
TRACING THE SCRIPTURAL VERSES OF HER LAWS
THE DAEDAL OF HER PATTERNED ARABESQUES
ART OF HER WISDOM ARTIFICE OF HER LORE
THIS ART THIS ARTIFICE ARE HER ONLY STOCK
IN HER HIGH WORKS OF PURE INTELLIGENCE
IN HER WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SENSES' TRAP
THERE COMES NO BREAKING OF THE WALLS OF MIND
THERE LEAPS NO RENDING FLASH OF ABSOLUTE POWER
THERE DAWNS NO LIGHT OF HEAVENLY CERTITUDE
A MILLION FACES WEARS HER KNOWLEDGE HERE
AND EVERY FACE IS TURBANED WITH A DOUBT
ALL NOW IS QUESTIONED ALL REDUCED TO NOUGHT
ONCE MONUMENTAL IN THEIR MASSIVE CRAFT
HER OLD GREAT MYTHIC WRITINGS DISAPPEAR
AND INTO THEIR PLACE START STRICT EPHEMERAL SIGNS
THIS CONSTANT CHANGE SPELLS PROGRESS TO HER EYES
252
HER THOUGHT IS AN ENDLESS MARCH WITHOUT A GOAL
THERE IS NO SUMMIT ON WHICH SHE CAN STAND
AND SEE IN A SINGLE GLANCE THE INFINITE'S WHOLE
AN INCONCLUSIVE PLAY IS REASON'S TOIL
EACH STRONG IDEA CAN USE HER AS ITS TOOL
ACCEPTING EVERY BRIEF SHE PLEADS HER CASE
OPEN TO EVERY THOUGHT SHE CANNOT KNOW
THE ETERNAL ADVOCATE SEATED AS JUDGE
ARMOURS IN LOGIC'S INVULNERABLE MAIL
A THOUSAND COMBATANTS FOR TRUTH'S VEILED THRONE
AND SETS ON A HIGH HORSE-BACK OF ARGUMENT
TO TILT FOR EVER WITH A WORDY LANCE
IN A MOCK TOURNAMENT WHERE NONE CAN WIN
ASSAYING THOUGHT'S VALUES WITH HER RIGID TESTS
BALANCED SHE SITS ON WIDE AND EMPTY AIR
ALOOF AND PURE IN HER IMPARTIAL POISE
ABSOLUTE HER JUDGMENTS SEEM BUT NONE IS SURE
TIME CANCELS ALL HER VERDICTS IN APPEAL
ALTHOUGH LIKE SUNBEAMS TO OUR GLOW-WORM MIND
HER KNOWLEDGE FEIGNS TO FALL FROM A CLEAR HEAVEN
ITS RAYS ARE A LANTERN'S LUSTRES IN THE NIGHT
SHE THROWS A GLITTERING ROBE ON IGNORANCE
BUT NOW IS LOST HER ANCIENT SOVEREIGN CLAIM
TO RULE MIND'S HIGH REALM IN HER ABSOLUTE RIGHT
BIND THOUGHT WITH LOGIC'S FORGED INFALLIBLE CHAIN
OR SEE TRUTH NUDE IN A BRIGHT ABSTRACT HAZE
A MASTER AND SLAVE OF STARK PHENOMENON
SHE TRAVELS ON THE ROADS OF ERRING SIGHT
OR LOOKS UPON A SET MECHANICAL WORLD
CONSTRUCTED FOR HER BY HER INSTRUMENTS
A BULLOCK YOKED IN THE CART OF PROVEN FACT
SHE DRAGS HUGE KNOWLEDGE-BALES THROUGH MATTER'S DUST
TO REACH UTILITY'S IMMENSE BAZAAR
APPRENTICE SHE HAS GROWN TO HER OLD DRUDGE
AN AIDED SENSE IS HER SEEKING'S ARBITER
THIS NOW SHE USES AS THE ASSAYER'S STONE
253
AS IF SHE KNEW NOT FACTS ARE HUSKS OF TRUTH
THE HUSKS SHE KEEPS THE KERNEL THROWS ASIDE
AN ANCIENT WISDOM FADES INTO THE PAST
THE AGES' FAITH BECOMES AN IDLE TALE
GOD PASSES OUT OF THE AWAKENED THOUGHT
AN OLD DISCARDED DREAM NEEDED NO MORE
ONLY SHE SEEKS MECHANIC NATURE'S KEYS
INTERPRETING STONE-LAWS INEVITABLE
SHE DIGS INTO MATTER'S HARD CONCEALING SOIL
TO UNEARTH THE PROCESSES OF ALL THINGS DONE
A LOADED HUGE SELF-WORKED MACHINE APPEARS
TO HER EYE'S EAGER AND ADMIRING STARE
AN INTRICATE AND MEANINGLESS ENGINERY
OF ORDERED FATEFUL AND UNFAILING CHANCE
INGENIOUS AND METICULOUS AND MINUTE
ITS BRUTE UNCONSCIOUS ACCURATE DEVICE
UNROLLS AN UNERRING MARCH MAPS A SURE ROAD
IT PLANS WITHOUT THINKING ACTS WITHOUT A WILL
A MILLION PURPOSES SERVES WITH PURPOSE NONE
AND BUILDS A RATIONAL WORLD WITHOUT A MIND
IT HAS NO MOVER NO MAKER NO IDEA
ITS VAST SELF-ACTION TOILS WITHOUT A CAUSE
A LIFELESS ENERGY IRRESISTIBLY DRIVEN
DEATH'S HEAD ON THE BODY OF NECESSITY
ENGENDERS LIFE AND FATHERS CONSCIOUSNESS
THEN WONDERS WHY ALL WAS AND WHENCE IT CAME
OUR THOUGHTS ARE PARTS OF THE IMMENSE MACHINE
OUR PONDERINGS BUT A FREAK OF MATTER'S LAW
THE MYSTIC'S LORE WAS A FANCY OR A BLIND
OF SOUL OR SPIRIT WE HAVE NOW NO NEED
MATTER IS THE ADMIRABLE REALITY
THE PATENT UNESCAPABLE MIRACLE
THE HARD TRUTH OF THINGS SIMPLE ETERNAL SOLE
A SUICIDAL RASH EXPENDITURE
CREATING THE WORLD BY A MYSTERY OF SELF-LOSS
HAS POURED ITS SCATTERED WORKS ON EMPTY SPACE
254
LATE SHALL THE SELF-DISINTEGRATING FORCE
CONTRACT THE IMMENSE EXPANSION IT HAS MADE
THEN ENDS THIS MIGHTY AND UNMEANING TOIL
THE VOID IS LEFT BARE VACANT AS BEFORE
THUS VINDICATED CROWNED THE GRAND NEW THOUGHT
EXPLAINED THE WORLD AND MASTERED ALL ITS LAWS
TOUCHED THE DUMB ROOTS WOKE VEILED TREMENDOUS POWERS
IT BOUND TO SERVICE THE UNCONSCIOUS DJINNS
THAT SLEEP UNUSED IN MATTER'S IGNORANT TRANCE
ALL WAS PRECISE RIGID INDUBITABLE
BUT WHEN ON MATTER'S ROCK OF AGES BASED
A WHOLE STOOD UP FIRM AND CLEAR-CUT AND SAFE
ALL STAGGERED BACK INTO A SEA OF DOUBT
THIS SOLID SCHEME MELTED IN ENDLESS FLUX
SHE HAD MET THE FORMLESS POWER INVENTOR OF FORMS
SUDDENLY SHE STUMBLED UPON THINGS UNSEEN
A LIGHTNING FROM THE UNDISCOVERED TRUTH
STARTLED HER EYES WITH ITS PERPLEXING GLARE
AND DUG A GULF BETWEEN THE REAL AND KNOWN
TILL ALL HER KNOWLEDGE SEEMED AN IGNORANCE
ONCE MORE THE WORLD WAS MADE A WONDER-WEB
A MAGIC'S PROCESS IN A MAGICAL SPACE
AN UNINTELLIGIBLE MIRACLE'S DEPTHS
WHOSE SOURCE IS LOST IN THE INEFFABLE
ONCE MORE WE FACE THE BLANK UNKNOWABLE
IN A CRASH OF VALUES IN A HUGE DOOM-CRACK
IN THE SPUTTER AND SCATTER OF HER BREAKING WORK
SHE LOST HER CLEAR CONSERVED CONSTRUCTED WORLD
A QUANTUM DANCE REMAINED A SPRAWL OF CHANCE
IN ENERGY'S STUPENDOUS TRIPPING WHIRL
A CEASELESS MOTION IN THE UNBOUNDED VOID
INVENTED FORMS WITHOUT A THOUGHT OR AIM
NECESSITY AND CAUSE WERE SHAPELESS GHOSTS
MATTER WAS AN INCIDENT IN BEING'S FLOW
LAW BUT A CLOCK-WORK HABIT OF BLIND FORCE
IDEALS ETHICS SYSTEMS HAD NO BASE
255
AND SOON COLLAPSED OR WITHOUT SANCTION LIVED
ALL GREW A CHAOS A HEAVE AND CLASH AND STRIFE
IDEAS WARRING AND FIERCE LEAPED UPON LIFE
A HARD COMPRESSION HELD DOWN ANARCHY
AND LIBERTY WAS ONLY A PHANTOM'S NAME
CREATION AND DESTRUCTION WALTZED INARMED
ON THE BOSOM OF A TORN AND QUAKING EARTH
ALL REELED INTO A WORLD OF KALI'S DANCE
THUS TUMBLED SINKING SPRAWLING IN THE VOID
CLUTCHING FOR PROPS A SOIL ON WHICH TO STAND
SHE ONLY SAW A THIN ATOMIC VAST
THE RARE-POINT SPARSE SUBSTRATUM UNIVERSE
ON WHICH FLOATS A SOLID WORLD'S PHENOMENAL FACE
ALONE A PROCESS OF EVENTS WAS THERE
AND NATURE'S PLASTIC AND PROTEAN CHANGE
AND STRONG BY DEATH TO SLAY OR TO CREATE
THE RIVEN INVISIBLE ATOM'S OMNIPOTENT FORCE
ONE CHANCE REMAINED THAT HERE MIGHT BE A POWER
TO LIBERATE MAN FROM THE OLD INADEQUATE MEANS
AND LEAVE HIM SOVEREIGN OF THE EARTHLY SCENE
FOR REASON THEN MIGHT GRASP THE ORIGINAL FORCE
TO DRIVE HER CAR UPON THE ROADS OF TIME
ALL THEN MIGHT SERVE THE NEED OF THE THINKING RACE
AN ABSOLUTE STATE FOUND ORDER'S ABSOLUTE
TO A STANDARDISED PERFECTION CUT ALL THINGS
IN SOCIETY BUILD A JUST EXACT MACHINE
THEN SCIENCE AND REASON CARELESS OF THE SOUL
COULD IRON OUT A TRANQUIL UNIFORM WORLD
AEONIC SEEKINGS GLUT WITH OUTWARD TRUTHS
AND A SINGLE-PATTERNED THINKING FORCE ON MIND
INFLICTING MATTER'S LOGIC ON SPIRIT'S DREAMS
A REASONABLE ANIMAL MAKE OF MAN
AND A SYMMETRICAL FABRIC OF HIS LIFE
THIS WOULD BE NATURE'S PEAK ON AN OBSCURE GLOBE
THE GRAND RESULT OF THE LONG AGES' TOIL
EARTH'S EVOLUTION CROWNED HER MISSION DONE
256
SO MIGHT IT BE IF THE SPIRIT FELL ASLEEP
MAN THEN MIGHT REST CONTENT AND LIVE IN PEACE
MASTER OF NATURE WHO ONCE HER BONDSLAVE WORKED
THE WORLD'S DISORDER HARDENING INTO LAW
IF LIFE'S DIRE HEART AROSE NOT IN REVOLT
IF GOD WITHIN COULD FIND NO GREATER PLAN
BUT MANY-VISAGED IS THE COSMIC SOUL
A TOUCH CAN ALTER THE FIXED FRONT OF FATE
A SUDDEN TURN CAN COME A ROAD APPEAR
A GREATER MIND MAY SEE A GREATER TRUTH
OR WE MAY FIND WHEN ALL THE REST HAS FAILED
HID IN OURSELVES THE KEY OF PERFECT CHANGE
ASCENDING FROM THE SOIL WHERE CREEP OUR DAYS
EARTH'S CONSCIOUSNESS MAY MARRY WITH THE SUN
OUR MORTAL LIFE RIDE ON THE SPIRIT'S WINGS
OUR FINITE THOUGHTS COMMUNE WITH THE INFINITE
IN THE BRIGHT KINGDOMS OF THE RISING SUN
ALL IS A BIRTH INTO A POWER OF LIGHT
ALL HERE DEFORMED GUARDS THERE ITS HAPPY SHAPE
HERE ALL IS MIXED AND MARRED THERE PURE AND WHOLE
YET EACH IS A PASSING STEP A MOMENT'S PHASE
AWAKE TO A GREATER TRUTH BEYOND HER ACTS
THE MEDIATRIX SAT AND SAW HER WORKS
AND FELT THE MARVEL IN THEM AND THE FORCE
BUT KNEW THE POWER BEHIND THE FACE OF TIME
SHE DID THE TASK OBEYED THE KNOWLEDGE GIVEN
HER DEEP HEART YEARNED TOWARDS GREAT IDEAL THINGS
AND FROM THE LIGHT LOOKED OUT TO WIDER LIGHT
A BRILLIANT HEDGE DRAWN ROUND HER NARROWED HER POWER
FAITHFUL TO HER LIMITED SPHERE SHE TOILED BUT KNEW
ITS HIGHEST WIDEST SEEING WAS A HALF-SEARCH
ITS MIGHTIEST ACTS A PASSAGE OR A STAGE
FOR NOT BY REASON WAS CREATION MADE
AND NOT BY REASON CAN THE TRUTH BE SEEN
WHICH THROUGH THE VEILS OF THOUGHT THE SCREENS OF SENSE
HARDLY THE SPIRIT'S VISION CAN DESCRY
257
DIMMED BY THE IMPERFECTION OF ITS MEANS
THE LITTLE MIND IS TIED TO LITTLE THINGS
ITS SENSE IS BUT THE SPIRIT'S OUTWARD TOUCH
HALF-WAKED IN A WORLD OF DARK INCONSCIENCE
IT FEELS OUT FOR ITS BEINGS AND ITS FORMS
LIKE ONE LEFT FUMBLING IN THE IGNORANT NIGHT
IN THIS SMALL MOULD OF INFANT MIND AND SENSE
DESIRE IS A CHILD-HEART'S CRY CRYING FOR BLISS
OUR REASON ONLY A TOYS' ARTIFICER
A RULE-MAKER IN A STRANGE STUMBLING GAME
BUT SHE HER DWARF AIDES KNEW WHOSE CONFIDENT SIGHT
A BOUNDED PROSPECT TOOK FOR THE FAR GOAL
THE WORLD SHE HAS MADE IS AN INTERIM REPORT
OF A TRAVELLER TOWARDS THE HALF-FOUND TRUTH IN THINGS
MOVING TWIXT NESCIENCE AND NESCIENCE
FOR NOTHING IS KNOWN WHILE AUGHT REMAINS CONCEALED
THE TRUTH IS KNOWN ONLY WHEN ALL IS SEEN
ATTRACTED BY THE ALL THAT IS THE ONE
SHE YEARNS TOWARDS A HIGHER LIGHT THAN HERS
HID BY HER CULTS AND CREEDS SHE HAS GLIMPSED GOD'S FACE
SHE KNOWS SHE HAS BUT FOUND A FORM A ROBE
BUT EVER SHE HOPES TO SEE HIM IN HER HEART
AND FEEL THE BODY OF HIS REALITY
AS YET A MASK IS THERE AND NOT A BROW
ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES TWO HIDDEN EYES APPEAR
REASON CANNOT TEAR OFF THAT GLIMMERING MASK
HER EFFORTS ONLY MAKE IT GLIMMER MORE
IN PACKETS SHE TIES UP THE INDIVISIBLE
FINDING HER HANDS TOO SMALL TO HOLD VAST TRUTH
SHE BREAKS UP KNOWLEDGE INTO ALIEN PARTS
OR PEERS THROUGH CLOUD-RACK FOR A VANISHED SUN
SHE SEES NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT SHE HAS SEEN
THROUGH THE LOCKED VISAGES OF FINITE THINGS
THE MYRIAD ASPECTS OF INFINITY
ONE DAY THE FACE MUST BURN OUT THROUGH THE MASK
OUR IGNORANCE IS WISDOM'S CHRYSALIS
258
OUR ERROR WEDS NEW KNOWLEDGE ON ITS WAY
ITS DARKNESS IS A BLACKENED KNOT OF LIGHT
THOUGHT DANCES HAND IN HAND WITH NESCIENCE
ON THE GREY ROAD THAT WINDS TOWARDS THE SUN
EVEN WHILE HER FINGERS FUMBLE AT THE KNOTS
WHICH BIND THEM TO THEIR STRANGE COMPANIONSHIP
INTO THE MOMENTS OF THEIR MARRIED STRIFE
SOMETIMES BREAK FLASHES OF THE ENLIGHTENING FIRE
EVEN NOW GREAT THOUGHTS ARE HERE THAT WALK ALONE
ARMED THEY HAVE COME WITH THE INFALLIBLE WORD
IN AN INVESTITURE OF INTUITIVE LIGHT
THAT IS A SANCTION FROM THE EYES OF GOD
ANNOUNCERS OF A DISTANT TRUTH THEY FLAME
ARRIVING FROM THE RIM OF ETERNITY
A FIRE SHALL COME OUT OF THE INFINITUDES
A GREATER GNOSIS SHALL REGARD THE WORLD
CROSSING OUT OF SOME FAR OMNISCIENCE
ON LUSTROUS SEAS FROM THE STILL RAPT ALONE
TO ILLUMINE THE DEEP HEART OF SELF AND THINGS
A TIMELESS KNOWLEDGE IT SHALL BRING TO MIND
ITS AIM TO LIFE TO IGNORANCE ITS CLOSE
ABOVE IN A HIGH BREATHLESS STRATOSPHERE
OVERSHADOWING THE DWARFISH TRINITY
LIVED ASPIRANTS TO A LIMITLESS BEYOND
CAPTIVES OF SPACE WALLED BY THE LIMITING HEAVENS
IN THE UNCEASING CIRCUIT OF THE HOURS
YEARNING FOR THE STRAIGHT PATHS OF ETERNITY
AND FROM THEIR HIGH STATION LOOKED DOWN ON THIS WORLD
TWO SUN-GAZE DAEMONS WITNESSING ALL THAT IS
A POWER TO UPLIFT THE LAGGARD WORLD
IMPERIOUS RODE A HUGE HIGH-WINGED LIFE-THOUGHT
UNWONT TO TREAD THE FIRM UNCHANGING SOIL
ACCUSTOMED TO A BLUE INFINITY
IT PLANED IN SUNLIT SKY AND STARLIT AIR
IT SAW AFAR THE UNREACHED IMMORTAL'S HOME
259
AND HEARD AFAR THE VOICES OF THE GODS
ICONOCLAST AND SHATTERER OF TIME'S FORTS
OVERLEAPING LIMIT AND EXCEEDING NORM
IT LIT THE THOUGHTS THAT GLOW THROUGH THE CENTURIES
AND MOVED TO ACTS OF SUPERHUMAN FORCE
AS FAR AS ITS SELF-WINGED AIR-PLANES COULD FLY
VISITING THE FUTURE IN GREAT BRILLIANT RAIDS
IT RECONNOITRED VISTAS OF DREAM-FATE
APT TO CONCEIVE UNABLE TO ATTAIN
IT DREW ITS CONCEPT-MAPS AND VISION-PLANS
TOO LARGE FOR THE ARCHITECTURE OF MORTAL SPACE
BEYOND IN WIDENESS WHERE NO FOOTING IS
AN IMAGIST OF BODILESS IDEAS
IMPASSIVE TO THE CRY OF LIFE AND SENSE
A PURE THOUGHT-MIND SURVEYED THE COSMIC ACT
ARCHANGEL OF A WHITE TRANSCENDING REALM
IT SAW THE WORLD FROM SOLITARY HEIGHTS
LUMINOUS IN A REMOTE AND EMPTY AIR
260
THERE CEASED THE LIMITS OF THE LABOURING POWER
BUT BEING AND CREATION CEASE NOT THERE
FOR THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THE CIRCLES OF MORTAL MIND
IT IS GREATER THAN ITS EARTHLY INSTRUMENT
THE GODHEAD CRAMMED INTO MIND'S NARROW SPACE
ESCAPES ON EVERY SIDE INTO SOME VAST
THAT IS A PASSAGE TO INFINITY
IT MOVES ETERNAL IN THE SPIRIT'S FIELD
A RUNNER TOWARDS THE FAR SPIRITUAL LIGHT
A CHILD AND SERVANT OF THE SPIRIT'S FORCE
BUT MIND TOO FALLS BACK FROM A NAMELESS PEAK
HIS BEING STRETCHED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THOUGHT
FOR THE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL AND UNMADE
AND NOT BY THINKING WAS ITS GREATNESS BORN
AND NOT BY THINKING CAN ITS KNOWLEDGE COME
IT KNOWS ITSELF AND IN ITSELF IT LIVES
IT MOVES WHERE NO THOUGHT IS NOR ANY FORM
ITS FEET ARE STEADIED UPON FINITE THINGS
ITS WINGS CAN DARE TO CROSS THE INFINITE
ARRIVING INTO HIS KEN A WONDER SPACE
OF GREAT AND MARVELLOUS MEETINGS CALLED HIS STEPS
WHERE THOUGHT LEANED ON A VISION BEYOND THOUGHT
AND SHAPED A WORLD FROM THE UNTHINKABLE
ON PEAKS IMAGINATION CANNOT TREAD
IN THE HORIZONS OF A TIRELESS SIGHT
UNDER A BLUE VEIL OF ETERNITY
THE SPLENDOURS OF IDEAL MIND WERE SEEN
OUTSTRETCHED ACROSS THE BOUNDARIES OF THINGS KNOWN
ORIGIN OF THE LITTLE THAT WE ARE
INSTINCT WITH THE ENDLESS MORE THAT WE MUST BE
A PROP OF ALL THAT HUMAN STRENGTH ENACTS
261
CREATOR OF HOPES BY EARTH UNREALISED
IT SPREADS BEYOND THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE
IT WINGS BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF DREAM
IT OVERTOPS THE CEILING OF LIFE'S SOAR
AWAKE IN A LUMINOUS SPHERE UNBOUND BY THOUGHT
EXPOSED TO OMNISCIENT IMMENSITIES
IT CASTS ON OUR WORLD ITS GREAT CROWNED INFLUENCES
ITS SPEED THAT OUTSTRIPS THE AMBLING OF THE HOURS
ITS FORCE THAT STRIDES INVINCIBLY THROUGH TIME
ITS MIGHTS THAT BRIDGE THE GULF TWIXT MAN AND GOD
ITS LIGHTS THAT COMBAT IGNORANCE AND DEATH
IN ITS VAST AMBIT OF IDEAL SPACE
WHERE BEAUTY AND MIGHTINESS WALK HAND IN HAND
THE SPIRIT'S TRUTHS TAKE FORM AS LIVING GODS
AND EACH CAN BUILD A WORLD IN ITS OWN RIGHT
IN AN AIR WHICH DOUBT AND ERROR CANNOT MARK
WITH THE STIGMATA OF THEIR DEFORMITY
IN COMMUNION WITH THE MUSING PRIVACY
OF A TRUTH THAT SEES IN AN UNERRING LIGHT
WHERE THE SIGHT FALTERS NOT NOR WANDERS THOUGHT
EXEMPT FROM OUR WORLD'S EXORBITANT TAX OF TEARS
DREAMING ITS LUMINOUS CREATIONS GAZE
ON THE IDEAS THAT PEOPLE ETERNITY
IN A SUN-BLAZE OF JOY AND ABSOLUTE POWER
ABOVE THE MASTERS OF THE IDEAL THRONE
IN SESSIONS OF SECURE FELICITY
IN REGIONS OF ILLUMINED CERTITUDE
FAR ARE THOSE REALMS FROM OUR LABOUR AND YEARNING AND CALL
PERFECTION'S REIGN AND HALLOWED SANCTUARY
CLOSED TO THE UNCERTAIN THOUGHTS OF HUMAN MIND
REMOTE FROM THE TURBID TREAD OF MORTAL LIFE
BUT SINCE OUR SECRET SELVES ARE NEXT OF KIN
A BREATH OF UNATTAINED DIVINITY
VISITS THE IMPERFECT EARTH ON WHICH WE TOIL
ACROSS A GLEAMING ETHER'S GOLDEN LAUGH
A LIGHT FALLS ON OUR VEXED UNSATISFIED LIVES
262
A THOUGHT COMES DOWN FROM THE IDEAL WORLDS
AND MOVES US TO NEW-MODEL EVEN HERE
SOME IMAGE OF THEIR GREATNESS AND APPEAL
AND WONDER BEYOND THE KEN OF MORTAL HOPE
AMID THE HEAVY SAMENESS OF THE DAYS
AND CONTRADICTED BY THE HUMAN LAW
A FAITH IN THINGS THAT ARE NOT AND MUST BE
LIVES COMRADE OF THIS WORLD'S DELIGHT AND PAIN
THE CHILD OF THE SECRET SOUL'S FORBIDDEN DESIRE
BORN OF ITS AMOUR WITH ETERNITY
OUR SPIRITS BREAK FREE FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT
THE FUTURE BRINGS ITS FACE OF MIRACLE NEAR
ITS GODHEAD LOOKS AT US WITH PRESENT EYES
ACTS DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE GROW NATURAL
WE FEEL THE HERO'S IMMORTALITY
THE COURAGE AND THE STRENGTH DEATH CANNOT TOUCH
AWAKE IN LIMBS THAT ARE MORTAL HEARTS THAT FAIL
WE MOVE BY THE RAPID IMPULSE OF A WILL
THAT SCORNS THE TARDY TRUDGE OF MORTAL TIME
THESE PROMPTINGS COME NOT FROM AN ALIEN SPHERE
OURSELVES ARE CITIZENS OF THAT MOTHER STATE
ADVENTURERS WE HAVE COLONISED MATTER'S NIGHT
BUT NOW OUR RIGHTS ARE BARRED OUR PASSPORTS VOID
WE LIVE SELF-EXILED FROM OUR HEAVENLIER HOME
AN ERRANT RAY FROM THE IMMORTAL MIND
ACCEPTED THE EARTH'S BLINDNESS AND BECAME
OUR HUMAN THOUGHT SERVANT OF IGNORANCE
AN EXILE LABOURER ON THIS UNSURE GLOBE
CAPTURED AND DRIVEN IN LIFE'S NESCIENT GRASP
HAMPERED BY OBSCURE CELL AND TREACHEROUS NERVE
IT DREAMS OF HAPPIER STATES AND NOBLER POWERS
THE NATURAL PRIVILEGE OF UNFALLEN GODS
RECALLING STILL ITS OLD LOST SOVEREIGNTY
AMIDST EARTH'S MIST AND FOG AND MUD AND STONE
IT STILL REMEMBERS ITS EXALTED SPHERE
AND THE HIGH CITY OF ITS SPLENDID BIRTH
263
A MEMORY STEALS IN FROM LOST HEAVENS OF TRUTH
A WIDE RELEASE COMES NEAR A GLORY CALLS
A MIGHT LOOKS OUT AN ESTRANGED FELICITY
IN GLAMOROUS PASSAGES OF HALF-VEILED LIGHT
WANDERING A BRILLIANT SHADOW OF ITSELF
THIS QUICK UNCERTAIN LEADER OF BLIND GODS
THIS TENDER OF SMALL LAMPS THIS MINISTER SERF
HIRED BY A MIND AND BODY FOR EARTH-USE
FORGETS ITS WORK MID CRUDE REALITIES
IT RECOVERS ITS RENOUNCED IMPERIAL RIGHT
IT WEARS ONCE MORE A PURPLE ROBE OF THOUGHT
AND KNOWS ITSELF THE IDEAL'S SEER AND KING
COMMUNICANT AND PROPHET OF THE UNBORN
HEIR TO DELIGHT AND IMMORTALITY
ALL THINGS ARE REAL THAT HERE ARE ONLY DREAMS
IN OUR UNKNOWN DEPTHS SLEEPS THEIR RESERVE OF TRUTH
ON OUR UNREACHED HEIGHTS THEY REIGN AND COME TO US
IN THOUGHT AND MUSE TRAILING THEIR ROBES OF LIGHT
BUT OUR DWARF WILL AND COLD PRAGMATIC SENSE
ADMIT NOT THE CELESTIAL VISITANTS
AWAITING US ON THE IDEAL'S PEAKS
OR GUARDED IN OUR SECRET SELF UNSEEN
YET FLASHED SOMETIMES ACROSS THE AWAKENED SOUL
HIDE FROM OUR LIVES THEIR GREATNESS BEAUTY POWER
OUR PRESENT FEELS SOMETIMES THEIR REGAL TOUCH
OUR FUTURE STRIVES TOWARDS THEIR LUMINOUS THRONES
OUT OF SPIRITUAL SECRECY THEY GAZE
IMMORTAL FOOTFALLS IN MIND'S CORRIDORS SOUND
OUR SOULS CAN CLIMB INTO THE SHINING PLANES
THE BREADTHS FROM WHICH THEY CAME CAN BE OUR HOME
HIS PRIVILEGE REGAINED OF SHADOWLESS SIGHT
THE THINKER ENTERED THE IMMORTALS' AIR
AND DRANK AGAIN HIS PURE AND MIGHTY SOURCE
IMMUTABLE IN RHYTHMIC CALM AND JOY
HE SAW SOVEREIGNLY FREE IN LIMITLESS LIGHT
THE UNFALLEN PLANES THE THOUGHT-CREATED WORLDS
264
WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS THE LEADER OF THE ACT
AND MATTER IS OF THINKING SUBSTANCE MADE
FEELING A HEAVEN-BIRD POISED ON DREAMING WINGS
ANSWERS TRUTH'S CALL AS TO A PARENT'S VOICE
FORM LUMINOUS LEAPS FROM THE ALL-SHAPING BEAM
AND WILL IS A CONSCIOUS CHARIOT OF THE GODS
AND LIFE A SPLENDOUR STREAM OF MUSING FORCE
CARRIES THE VOICES OF THE MYSTIC SUNS
A HAPPINESS IT BRINGS OF WHISPERED TRUTH
THERE RUNS IN ITS FLOW HONEYING THE BOSOM OF SPACE
A LAUGHTER FROM THE IMMORTAL HEART OF BLISS
AND THE UNFATHOMED JOY OF TIMELESSNESS
THE SOUND OF WISDOM'S MURMUR IN THE UNKNOWN
AND THE BREATH OF AN UNSEEN INFINITY
IN GLEAMING CLARITIES OF AMETHYST AIR
THE CHAINLESS AND OMNIPOTENT SPIRIT OF MIND
BROODED ON THE BLUE LOTUS OF THE IDEA
A GOLD SUPERNAL SUN OF TIMELESS TRUTH
POURED DOWN THE MYSTERY OF THE ETERNAL RAY
THROUGH A SILENCE QUIVERING WITH THE WORD OF LIGHT
ON AN ENDLESS OCEAN OF DISCOVERY
FAR-OFF HE SAW THE JOINING HEMISPHERES
ON MEDITATION'S MOUNTING EDGE OF TRANCE
GREAT STAIRS OF THOUGHT CLIMBED UP TO UNBORN HEIGHTS
WHERE TIME'S LAST RIDGES TOUCH ETERNITY'S SKIES
AND NATURE SPEAKS TO THE SPIRIT'S ABSOLUTE
A TRIPLE REALM OF ORDERED THOUGHT CAME FIRST
A SMALL BEGINNING OF IMMENSE ASCENT
ABOVE WERE BRIGHT ETHEREAL SKIES OF MIND
A PACKED AND ENDLESS SOAR AS IF SKY PRESSED SKY
BUTTRESSED AGAINST THE VOID ON BASTIONED LIGHT
THE HIGHEST STROVE TO NEIGHBOUR ETERNITY
THE LARGEST WIDENED INTO THE INFINITE
BUT THOUGH IMMORTAL MIGHTY AND DIVINE
THE FIRST REALMS WERE CLOSE AND KIN TO HUMAN MIND
265
THEIR DEITIES SHAPE OUR GREATER THINKING'S ROADS
A FRAGMENT OF THEIR PUISSANCE CAN BE OURS
THESE BREADTHS WERE NOT TOO BROAD FOR OUR SOULS TO RANGE
THESE HEIGHTS WERE NOT TOO HIGH FOR HUMAN HOPE
A TRIPLE FLIGHT LED TO THIS TRIPLE WORLD
ALTHOUGH ABRUPT FOR COMMON STRENGTHS TO TREAD
ITS UPWARD SLOPE LOOKS DOWN ON OUR EARTH-POISE
ON A SLANT NOT TOO PRECIPITOUSLY STEEP
ONE COULD TURN BACK TRAVELLING DEEP DESCENDING LINES
TO COMMUNE WITH THE MORTAL'S UNIVERSE
THE MIGHTY WARDENS OF THE ASCENDING STAIR
WHO INTERCEDE WITH THE ALL-CREATING WORD
THERE WAITED FOR THE PILGRIM HEAVEN-BOUND SOUL
HOLDING THE THOUSAND KEYS OF THE BEYOND
THEY PROFFERED THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO THE CLIMBING MIND
AND FILLED THE LIFE WITH THOUGHT'S IMMENSITIES
THE PROPHET HIEROPHANTS OF THE OCCULT LAW
THE FLAME-BRIGHT HIERARCHS OF THE DIVINE TRUTH
INTERPRETERS BETWEEN MAN'S MIND AND GOD'S
THEY BRING THE IMMORTAL FIRE TO MORTAL MEN
IRIDESCENT BODYING THE INVISIBLE
THE GUARDIANS OF THE ETERNAL'S BRIGHT DEGREES
FRONTED THE SUN IN RADIANT PHALANXES
AFAR THEY SEEMED A SYMBOL IMAGERY
ILLUMINED ORIGINALS OF THE SHADOWY SCRIPT
IN WHICH OUR SIGHT TRANSCRIBES THE IDEAL RAY
OR ICONS FIGURING A MYSTIC TRUTH
BUT NEARER GODS AND LIVING PRESENCES
A MARCH OF FRIEZES MARKED THE LOWEST STEPS
FANTASTICALLY ORNATE AND RICHLY SMALL
THEY HAD ROOM FOR THE WHOLE MEANING OF A WORLD
SYMBOLS MINUTE OF ITS PERFECTION'S JOY
STRANGE BEASTS THAT WERE NATURE'S FORCES MADE ALIVE
AND WAKENED TO THE WONDER OF HIS ROLE
MAN GROWN AN IMAGE UNDEFACED OF GOD
AND OBJECTS THE FINE COIN OF BEAUTY'S REIGN
266
BUT WIDE THE TERRAINS WERE THOSE LEVELS SERVE
IN FRONT OF THE ASCENDING EPIPHANY
WORLD-TIME'S ENJOYERS FAVOURITES OF WORLD-BLISS
THE MASTERS OF THINGS ACTUAL LORDS OF THE HOURS
PLAYMATES OF YOUTHFUL NATURE AND CHILD GOD
CREATORS OF MATTER BY HID STRESS OF MIND
WHOSE SUBTLE THOUGHTS SUPPORT UNCONSCIOUS LIFE
AND GUIDE THE FANTASY OF BRUTE EVENTS
STOOD THERE A RACE OF YOUNG KEEN-VISIONED GODS
KING-CHILDREN BORN ON WISDOM'S EARLY PLANE
TAUGHT IN HER SCHOOL WORLD-MAKING'S MYSTIC PLAY
ARCHMASONS OF THE ETERNAL THAUMATURGE
MOULDERS AND MEASURERS OF FRAGMENTED SPACE
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR PLAN OF THE CONCEALED AND KNOWN
A DWELLING-HOUSE FOR THE INVISIBLE KING
OBEYING THE ETERNAL'S DEEP COMMAND
THEY HAVE BUILT IN THE MATERIAL FRONT OF THINGS
THIS WIDE WORLD-KINDERGARTEN OF YOUNG SOULS
WHERE THE INFANT SPIRIT LEARNS THROUGH MIND AND SENSE
TO READ THE LETTERS OF THE COSMIC SCRIPT
AND STUDY THE BODY OF THE COSMIC SELF
AND SEARCH FOR THE SECRET MEANING OF THE WHOLE
TO ALL THAT SPIRIT CONCEIVES THEY GIVE A MOULD
PERSUADING NATURE INTO VISIBLE MOODS
THEY LEND A FINITE SHAPE TO INFINITE THINGS
EACH POWER THAT LEAPS FROM THE UNMANIFEST
LEAVING THE LARGENESS OF THE ETERNAL'S PEACE
THEY SEIZED AND HELD BY THEIR PRECISIAN EYE
AND MADE A FIGURANTE IN THE COSMIC DANCE
ITS FREE CAPRICE THEY BOUND BY RHYTHMIC LAWS
AND COMPELLED TO ACCEPT ITS POSTURE AND ITS LINE
IN THE WIZARDRY OF AN ORDERED UNIVERSE
THE ALL-CONTAINING WAS CONTAINED IN FORM
ONENESS WAS CARVED INTO UNITS MEASURABLE
THE LIMITLESS BUILT INTO A COSMIC SUM
UNENDING SPACE WAS BEATEN INTO A CURVE
267
INDIVISIBLE TIME INTO SMALL MINUTES CUT
THE INFINITESIMAL MASSED TO KEEP SECURE
THE MYSTERY OF THE FORMLESS CAST INTO FORM
INVINCIBLY THEIR CRAFT DEVISED FOR USE
THE MAGIC OF SEQUENT NUMBER AND SIGN'S SPELL
DESIGN'S MIRACULOUS POTENCY WAS CAUGHT
LADEN WITH BEAUTY AND SIGNIFICANCE
AND BY THE DETERMINING MANDATE OF THEIR GAZE
FIGURE AND QUALITY EQUATING JOINED
IN AN INEXTRICABLE IDENTITY
ON EACH EVENT THEY STAMPED ITS CURVES OF LAW
AND ITS TRUST AND CHARGE OF BURDENED CIRCUMSTANCE
A FREE AND DIVINE INCIDENT NO MORE
AT EACH MOMENT WILLED OR ADVENTURE OF THE SOUL
IT LENGTHENED A FATE-BOUND MYSTERIOUS CHAIN
A LINE FORESEEN OF AN IMMUTABLE PLAN
ONE STEP MORE IN NECESSITY'S LONG MARCH
A TERM WAS SET FOR EVERY EAGER POWER
RESTRAINING ITS WILL TO MONOPOLISE THE WORLD
A GROOVE OF BRONZE PRESCRIBED FOR FORCE AND ACT
AND SHOWN TO EACH MOMENT ITS APPOINTED PLACE
FOREWILLED INALTERABLY IN THE SPIRAL
HUGE TIME-LOOP FUGITIVE FROM ETERNITY
INEVITABLE THEIR THOUGHTS LIKE LINKS OF FATE
IMPOSED ON THE LEAP AND LIGHTNING RACE OF MIND
AND ON THE FRAIL FORTUITOUS FLUX OF LIFE
AND ON THE LIBERTY OF ATOMIC THINGS
IMMUTABLE CAUSE AND ADAMANT CONSEQUENCE
IDEA GAVE UP THE PLASTIC INFINITY
TO WHICH IT WAS BORN AND NOW TRACED OUT INSTEAD
SMALL SEPARATE STEPS OF CHAIN-WORK IN A PLOT
IMMORTAL ONCE NOW TIED TO BIRTH AND END
TORN FROM ITS IMMEDIACY OF ERRORLESS SIGHT
KNOWLEDGE WAS REBUILT FROM CELLS OF INFERENCE
INTO A FIXED BODY FLASQUE AND PERISHABLE
THUS BOUND IT GREW BUT COULD NOT LAST AND BROKE
268
AND TO A NEW THINKING'S BODY LEFT ITS PLACE
A CAGE FOR THE INFINITE'S GREAT-EYED SERAPHIM THOUGHTS
WAS CLOSED WITH A CRISS-CROSS OF WORLD-LAWS FOR BARS
AND HEDGED INTO A CURT HORIZON'S ARC
THE IRISED VISION OF THE INEFFABLE
A TIMELESS SPIRIT WAS MADE THE SLAVE OF THE HOURS
THE UNBOUND WAS CAST INTO A PRISON OF BIRTH
TO MAKE A WORLD THAT MIND COULD GRASP AND RULE
ON AN EARTH WHICH LOOKED TOWARDS A THOUSAND SUNS
THAT THE CREATED MIGHT GROW NATURE'S LORD
AND MATTER'S DEPTHS BE ILLUMINED WITH A SOUL
THEY TIED TO DATE AND NORM AND FINITE SCOPE
THE MILLION-MYSTERIED MOVEMENT OF THE ONE
ABOVE STOOD RANKED A SUBTLE ARCHANGEL RACE
WITH LARGER LIDS AND LOOKS THAT SEARCHED THE UNSEEN
A LIGHT OF LIBERATING KNOWLEDGE SHONE
ACROSS THE GULFS OF SILENCE IN THEIR EYES
THEY LIVED IN THE MIND AND KNEW TRUTH FROM WITHIN
A SIGHT WITHDRAWN IN THE CONCENTRATED HEART
COULD PIERCE BEHIND THE SCREEN OF TIME'S RESULTS
AND THE RIGID CAST AND SHAPE OF VISIBLE THINGS
ALL THAT ESCAPED CONCEPTION'S NARROW NOOSE
VISION DESCRIED AND GRIPPED THEIR SEEING THOUGHTS
FILLED IN THE BLANKS LEFT BY THE SEEKING SENSE
HIGH ARCHITECTS OF POSSIBILITY
AND ENGINEERS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE
MATHEMATICIANS OF THE INFINITUDES
AND THEORICIANS OF UNKNOWABLE TRUTHS
THEY FORMULATE ENIGMA'S POSTULATES
AND JOIN THE UNKNOWN TO THE APPARENT WORLDS
ACOLYTES THEY WAIT UPON THE TIMELESS POWER
THE CYCLE OF HER WORKS INVESTIGATE
PASSING HER FENCE OF WORDLESS PRIVACY
THEIR MIND COULD PENETRATE HER OCCULT MIND
AND DRAW THE DIAGRAM OF HER SECRET THOUGHTS
THEY READ THE CODES AND CIPHERS SHE HAD SEALED
269
COPIES THEY MADE OF ALL HER GUARDED PLANS
FOR EVERY TURN OF HER MYSTERIOUS COURSE
ASSIGNED A REASON AND UNCHANGING RULE
THE UNSEEN GREW VISIBLE TO STUDENT EYES
EXPLAINED WAS THE IMMENSE INCONSCIENT'S SCHEME
AUDACIOUS LINES WERE TRACED UPON THE VOID
THE INFINITE WAS REDUCED TO SQUARE AND CUBE
ARRANGING SYMBOL AND SIGNIFICANCE
TRACING THE CURVE OF A TRANSCENDENT POWER
THEY FRAMED THE CABBALA OF THE COSMIC LAW
THE BALANCING LINE DISCOVERED OF LIFE'S TECHNIQUE
AND STRUCTURED HER MAGIC AND HER MYSTERY
IMPOSING SCHEMES OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE VAST
THEY CLAMPED TO SYLLOGISMS OF FINITE THOUGHT
THE FREE LOGIC OF AN INFINITE CONSCIOUSNESS
GRAMMARED THE HIDDEN RHYTHMS OF NATURE'S DANCE
CRITIQUED THE PLOT OF THE DRAMA OF THE WORLDS
MADE FIGURE AND NUMBER A KEY TO ALL THAT IS
THE PSYCHO-ANALYSIS OF COSMIC SELF
WAS TRACED ITS SECRETS HUNTED DOWN AND READ
THE UNKNOWN PATHOLOGY OF THE UNIQUE
ASSESSED WAS THE SYSTEM OF THE PROBABLE
THE HAZARD OF FLEEING POSSIBILITIES
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ACTUAL'S UNACCOUNTABLE SUM
NECESSITY'S LOGARITHMIC TABLES DRAWN
CAST INTO A SCHEME THE TRIPLE ACT OF THE ONE
UNVEILED THE ABRUPT INVISIBLE MULTITUDE
OF FORCES WHIRLING FROM THE HANDS OF CHANCE
SEEMED TO OBEY SOME VAST IMPERATIVE
THEIR TANGLED MOTIVES WORKED OUT UNITY
A WISDOM READ THEIR MIND TO THEMSELVES UNKNOWN
THEIR ANARCHY RAMMED INTO A FORMULA
AND FROM THEIR GIANT RANDOMNESS OF FORCE
FOLLOWING THE HABIT OF THEIR MILLION PATHS
DISTINGUISHING EACH FAINTEST LINE AND STROKE
OF A CONCEALED UNALTERABLE DESIGN
270
OUT OF THE CHAOS OF THE INVISIBLE'S MOODS
DERIVED THE CALCULUS OF DESTINY
IN ITS BRIGHT PRIDE OF UNIVERSAL LORE
MIND'S KNOWLEDGE OVERTOPPED THE OMNISCIENT'S POWER
THE ETERNAL'S WINGING EAGLE PUISSANCES
SURPRISED IN THEIR UNTRACKED EMPYREAN
STOOPED FROM THEIR GYRES TO OBEY THE BECK OF THOUGHT
EACH MYSTERIED GOD FORCED TO REVEALING FORM
ASSIGNED HIS SETTLED MOVES IN NATURE'S GAME
ZIGZAGGED AT THE GESTURE OF A CHESS-PLAYER WILL
ACROSS THE CHEQUERBOARD OF COSMIC FATE
IN THE WIDE SEQUENCE OF NECESSITY'S STEPS
PREDICTED EVERY ACT AND THOUGHT OF GOD
ITS VALUES WEIGHED BY THE ACCOUNTANT MIND
CHECKED IN HIS MATHEMATISED OMNIPOTENCE
LOST ITS DIVINE ASPECT OF MIRACLE
AND WAS A FIGURE IN A COSMIC SUM
THE MIGHTY MOTHER'S WHIMS AND LIGHTNING MOODS
ARISEN FROM HER ALL-WISE UNRULED DELIGHT
IN THE FREEDOM OF HER SWEET AND PASSIONATE BREAST
ROBBED OF THEIR WONDER WERE CHAINED TO A CAUSE AND AIM
AN IDOL OF BRONZE REPLACED HER MYSTIC SHAPE
THAT CAPTURES THE MOVEMENTS OF THE COSMIC VASTS
IN THE SKETCH PRECISE OF AN IDEAL FACE
FORGOTTEN WAS HER EYELASHES' DREAM-PRINT
CARRYING ON THEIR CURVE INFINITY'S DREAMS
LOST THE ALLURING MARVEL OF HER EYES
THE SURGING WAVE-THROBS OF HER VAST SEA-HEART
THEY BOUND TO A THEOREM OF ORDERED BEATS
HER DEEP DESIGNS WHICH FROM HERSELF SHE HAD VEILED
BOWED SELF-REVEALED IN THEIR CONFESSIONAL
FOR THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF THE WORLDS THEY FIXED A DATE
THE DIAMETER OF INFINITY WAS DRAWN
MEASURED THE DISTANT ARC OF THE UNSEEN HEIGHTS
AND VISUALISED THE PLUMBLESS VIEWLESS DEPTHS
TILL ALL SEEMED KNOWN THAT IN ALL TIME COULD BE
271
ALL WAS COERCED BY NUMBER NAME AND FORM
NOTHING WAS LEFT UNTOLD INCALCULABLE
YET WAS THEIR WISDOM CIRCLED WITH A NOUGHT
TRUTHS THEY COULD FIND AND HOLD BUT NOT THE ONE TRUTH
THE HIGHEST WAS TO THEM UNKNOWABLE
BY KNOWING TOO MUCH THEY MISSED THE WHOLE TO BE KNOWN
THE FATHOMLESS HEART OF THE WORLD WAS LEFT UNGUESSED
AND THE TRANSCENDENT KEPT ITS SECRECY
IN A SUBLIMER AND MORE DARING SOAR
TO THE WIDE SUMMIT OF THE TRIPLE STAIRS
BARE STEPS CLIMBED UP LIKE FLAMING ROCKS OF GOLD
BURNING THEIR WAY TO A PURE ABSOLUTE SKY
AUGUST AND FEW THE SOVEREIGN KINGS OF THOUGHT
HAVE MADE OF SPACE THEIR WIDE ALL-SEEING GAZE
SURVEYING THE ENORMOUS WORK OF TIME
A BREADTH OF ALL-CONTAINING CONSCIOUSNESS
SUPPORTED BEING IN A STILL EMBRACE
INTERCESSORS WITH A LUMINOUS UNSEEN
THEY CAPT IN THE LONG PASSAGE TO THE WORLD
THE IMPERATIVES OF THE CREATOR SELF
OBEYED BY UNKNOWING EARTH BY CONSCIOUS HEAVEN
THEIR THOUGHTS ARE PARTNERS IN ITS VAST CONTROL
A GREAT ALL-RULING CONSCIOUSNESS IS THERE
AND MIND UNWITTING SERVES A HIGHER POWER
IT IS A CHANNEL NOT THE SOURCE OF ALL
THE COSMOS IS NO ACCIDENT IN TIME
THERE IS A MEANING IN EACH PLAY OF CHANCE
THERE IS A FREEDOM IN EACH FACE OF FATE
A WISDOM KNOWS AND GUIDES THE MYSTERIED WORLD
A TRUTH-GAZE SHAPES ITS BEINGS AND EVENTS
A WORD SELF-BORN UPON CREATION'S HEIGHTS
VOICE OF THE ETERNAL IN THE TEMPORAL SPHERES
PROPHET OF THE SEEINGS OF THE ABSOLUTE
SOWS THE IDEA'S SIGNIFICANCE IN FORM
AND FROM THAT SEED THE GROWTHS OF TIME ARISE
ON PEAKS BEYOND OUR KEN THE ALL-WISDOM SITS
272
A SINGLE AND INFALLIBLE LOOK COMES DOWN
A SILENT TOUCH FROM THE SUPERNAL'S AIR
AWAKES TO IGNORANT KNOWLEDGE IN ITS ACTS
THE SECRET POWER IN THE INCONSCIENT DEPTHS
COMPELLING THE BLINDED GODHEAD TO EMERGE
DETERMINING NECESSITY'S NUDE DANCE
AS SHE PASSES THROUGH THE CIRCUIT OF THE HOURS
AND VANISHES FROM THE CHASE OF FINITE EYES
DOWN CIRCLING VISTAS OF AEONIC TIME
THE UNSEIZABLE FORCES OF THE COSMIC WHIRL
BEAR IN THEIR BACCHANT LIMBS THE FIXITY
OF AN ORIGINAL FORESIGHT THAT IS FATE
EVEN NATURE'S IGNORANCE IS TRUTH'S INSTRUMENT
OUR STRUGGLING EGO CANNOT CHANGE HER COURSE
YET IS IT A CONSCIOUS POWER THAT MOVES IN US
A SEED-IDEA IS PARENT OF OUR ACTS
AND DESTINY THE UNRECOGNISED CHILD OF WILL
INFALLIBLY BY TRUTH'S DIRECTING GAZE
ALL CREATURES HERE THEIR SECRET SELF DISCLOSE
FORCED TO BECOME WHAT IN THEMSELVES THEY HIDE
FOR HE WHO IS GROWS MANIFEST IN THE YEARS
AND THE SLOW GODHEAD SHUT WITHIN THE CELL
CLIMBS FROM THE PLASM TO IMMORTALITY
BUT HIDDEN BUT DENIED TO MORTAL GRASP
MYSTIC INEFFABLE IS THE SPIRIT'S TRUTH
UNSPOKEN CAUGHT ONLY BY THE SPIRIT'S EYE
WHEN NAKED OF EGO AND MIND IT HEARS THE VOICE
IT LOOKS THROUGH LIGHT TO EVER GREATER LIGHT
AND SEES ETERNITY ENSPHERING LIFE
THIS GREATER TRUTH IS FOREIGN TO OUR THOUGHTS
WHERE A FREE WISDOM WORKS THEY SEEK FOR A RULE
OR WE ONLY SEE A TRIPPING GAME OF CHANCE
OR A LABOUR IN CHAINS FORCED BY BOUND NATURE'S LAW
AN ABSOLUTISM OF DUMB UNTHINKING POWER
AUDACIOUS IN THEIR SENSE OF GOD-BORN STRENGTH
THESE DARED TO GRASP WITH THEIR THOUGHT TRUTH'S ABSOLUTE
273
BY AN ABSTRACT PURITY OF GODLESS SIGHT
BY A PERCEPT NUDE INTOLERANT OF FORMS
THEY BROUGHT TO MIND WHAT MIND COULD NEVER REACH
AND HOPED TO CONQUER TRUTH'S SUPERNAL BASE
A STRIPPED IMPERATIVE OF CONCEPTUAL PHRASE
ARCHITECTONIC AND INEVITABLE
TRANSLATED THE UNTHINKABLE INTO THOUGHT
A SILVER-WINGED FIRE OF NAKED SUBTLE SENSE
AN EAR OF MIND WITHDRAWN FROM THE OUTWARD'S RHYMES
DISCOVERED THE SEED-SOUNDS OF THE ETERNAL WORD
THE RHYTHM AND MUSIC HEARD THAT BUILT THE WORLDS
AND SEIZED IN THINGS THE BODILESS WILL TO BE
THE ILLIMITABLE THEY MEASURED WITH NUMBER'S RODS
AND TRACED THE LAST FORMULA OF LIMITED THINGS
IN TRANSPARENT SYSTEMS BODIED TERMLESS TRUTHS
THE TIMELESS MADE ACCOUNTABLE TO TIME
AND VALUED THE INCOMMENSURABLE SUPREME
TO PARK AND HEDGE THE UNGRASPED INFINITUDES
THEY ERECTED ABSOLUTE WALLS OF THOUGHT AND SPEECH
AND MADE A VACUUM TO HOLD THE ONE
IN THEIR SIGHT THEY DROVE TOWARDS AN EMPTY PEAK
A MIGHTY SPACE OF COLD AND SUNLIT AIR
TO UNIFY THEIR TASK EXCLUDING LIFE
WHICH CANNOT BEAR THE NAKEDNESS OF THE VAST
THEY MADE A CIPHER OF A MULTITUDE
IN NEGATION FOUND THE MEANING OF THE ALL
AND IN NOTHINGNESS THE ABSOLUTE POSITIVE
A SINGLE LAW SIMPLESSED THE COSMIC THEME
COMPRESSING NATURE INTO A FORMULA
THEIR TITAN LABOUR MADE ALL KNOWLEDGE ONE
A MENTAL ALGEBRA OF THE SPIRIT'S WAYS
AN ABSTRACT OF THE LIVING DIVINITY
HERE THE MIND'S WISDOM STOPPED IT FELT COMPLETE
FOR NOTHING MORE WAS LEFT TO THINK OR KNOW
IN A SPIRITUAL ZERO IT SAT THRONED
AND TOOK ITS VAST SILENCE FOR THE INEFFABLE
274
THIS WAS THE PLAY OF THE BRIGHT GODS OF THOUGHT
ATTRACTING INTO TIME THE TIMELESS LIGHT
IMPRISONING ETERNITY IN THE HOURS
THIS THEY HAVE PLANNED TO SNARE THE FEET OF TRUTH
IN AN AUREATE NET OF CONCEPT AND OF PHRASE
AND KEEP HER CAPTIVE FOR THE THINKER'S JOY
IN HIS LITTLE WORLD BUILT OF IMMORTAL DREAMS
THERE MUST SHE DWELL MURED IN THE HUMAN MIND
AN EMPRESS PRISONER IN HER SUBJECT'S HOUSE
ADORED AND PURE AND STILL ON HIS HEART'S THRONE
HIS SPLENDID PROPERTY CHERISHED AND APART
IN THE WALL OF SILENCE OF HIS SECRET MUSE
IMMACULATE IN WHITE VIRGINITY
THE SAME FOR EVER AND FOR EVER ONE
HIS WORSHIPPED CHANGELESS GODDESS THROUGH ALL TIME
OR ELSE A FAITHFUL CONSORT OF HIS MIND
ASSENTING TO HIS NATURE AND HIS WILL
SHE SANCTIONS AND INSPIRES HIS WORDS AND ACTS
PROLONGING THEIR RESONANCE THROUGH THE LISTENING YEARS
COMPANION AND RECORDER OF HIS MARCH
CROSSING A BRILLIANT TRACT OF THOUGHT AND LIFE
CARVED OUT OF THE ETERNITY OF TIME
A WITNESS TO HIS HIGH TRIUMPHANT STAR
HER GODHEAD SERVITOR TO A CROWNED IDEA
HE SHALL DOMINATE BY HER A PROSTRATE WORLD
A WARRANT FOR HIS DEEDS AND HIS BELIEFS
SHE ATTESTS HIS RIGHT DIVINE TO LEAD AND RULE
OR AS A LOVER CLASPS HIS ONE BELOVED
GODHEAD OF HIS LIFE'S WORSHIP AND DESIRE
ICON OF HIS HEART'S SOLE IDOLATRY
SHE NOW IS HIS AND MUST LIVE FOR HIM ALONE
SHE HAS INVADED HIM WITH HER SUDDEN BLISS
AN EXHAUSTLESS MARVEL IN HIS HAPPY GRASP
AN ALLUREMENT A CAUGHT RAVISHING MIRACLE
HER NOW HE CLAIMS AFTER LONG RAPT PURSUIT
THE ONE JOY OF HIS BODY AND HIS SOUL
275
INESCAPABLE IS HER DIVINE APPEAL
HER IMMENSE POSSESSION AN UNDYING THRILL
AN INTOXICATION AND AN ECSTASY
THE PASSION OF HER SELF-REVEALING MOODS
A HEAVENLY GLORY AND VARIETY
MAKES EVER NEW HER BODY TO HIS EYES
OR ELSE REPEATS THE FIRST ENCHANTMENT'S TOUCH
THE LUMINOUS RAPTURE OF HER MYSTIC BREASTS
AND BEAUTIFUL VIBRANT LIMBS A LIVING FIELD
OF THROBBING NEW DISCOVERY WITHOUT END
A NEW BEGINNING FLOWERS IN WORD AND LAUGH
A NEW CHARM BRINGS BACK THE OLD EXTREME DELIGHT
HE IS LOST IN HER SHE IS HIS HEAVEN HERE
TRUTH SMILED UPON THE GRACIOUS GOLDEN GAME
OUT OF HER HUSHED ETERNAL SPACES LEANED
THE GREAT AND BOUNDLESS GODDESS FEIGNED TO YIELD
THE SUNLIT SWEETNESS OF HER SECRECIES
INCARNATING HER BEAUTY IN HIS CLASP
SHE GAVE FOR A BRIEF KISS HER IMMORTAL LIPS
AND DREW TO HER BOSOM ONE GLORIFIED MORTAL HEAD
SHE MADE EARTH HER HOME FOR WHOM HEAVEN WAS TOO SMALL
IN A HUMAN BREAST HER OCCULT PRESENCE LIVED
HE CARVED FROM HIS OWN SELF HIS FIGURE OF HER
SHE SHAPED HER BODY TO A MIND'S EMBRACE
INTO THOUGHT'S NARROW LIMITS SHE HAS COME
HER GREATNESS SHE HAS SUFFERED TO BE PRESSED
INTO THE LITTLE CABIN OF THE IDEA
THE CLOSED ROOM OF A LONELY THINKER'S GRASP
SHE HAS LOWERED HER HEIGHTS TO THE STATURE OF OUR SOULS
AND DAZZLED OUR LIDS WITH HER CELESTIAL GAZE
THUS EACH IS SATISFIED WITH HIS HIGH GAIN
AND THINKS HIMSELF BEYOND MORTALITY BLEST
A KING OF TRUTH UPON HIS SEPARATE THRONE
TO HER POSSESSOR IN THE FIELD OF TIME
A SINGLE SPLENDOUR CAUGHT FROM HER GLORY SEEMS
THE ONE TRUE LIGHT HER BEAUTY'S GLOWING WHOLE
276
BUT THOUGHT NOR WORD CAN SEIZE ETERNAL TRUTH
THE WHOLE WORLD LIVES IN A LONELY RAY OF HER SUN
IN OUR THINKING'S CLOSE AND NARROW LAMP-LIT HOUSE
THE VANITY OF OUR SHUT MORTAL MIND
DREAMS THAT THE CHAINS OF THOUGHT HAVE MADE HER OURS
BUT ONLY WE PLAY WITH OUR OWN BRILLIANT BONDS
TYING HER DOWN IT IS OURSELVES WE TIE
IN OUR HYPNOSIS BY ONE LUMINOUS POINT
WE SEE NOT WHAT SMALL FIGURE OF HER WE HOLD
WE FEEL NOT HER INSPIRING BOUNDLESSNESS
WE SHARE NOT HER IMMORTAL LIBERTY
THUS IS IT EVEN WITH THE SEER AND SAGE
FOR STILL THE HUMAN LIMITS THE DIVINE
OUT OF OUR THOUGHTS WE MUST LEAP UP TO SIGHT
BREATHE HER DIVINE ILLIMITABLE AIR
HER SIMPLE VAST SUPREMACY CONFESS
DARE TO SURRENDER TO HER ABSOLUTE
THEN THE UNMANIFEST REFLECTS HIS FORM
IN THE STILL MIND AS IN A LIVING GLASS
THE TIMELESS RAY DESCENDS INTO OUR HEARTS
AND WE ARE RAPT INTO ETERNITY
FOR TRUTH IS WIDER GREATER THAN HER FORMS
A THOUSAND ICONS THEY HAVE MADE OF HER
AND FIND HER IN THE IDOLS THEY ADORE
BUT SHE REMAINS HERSELF AND INFINITE
277
ALWAYS THE IDEAL BECKONED FROM AFAR
AWAKENED BY THE TOUCH OF THE UNSEEN
DESERTING THE BOUNDARY OF THINGS ACHIEVED
ASPIRED THE STRONG DISCOVERER TIRELESS THOUGHT
REVEALING AT EACH STEP A LUMINOUS WORLD
IT LEFT KNOWN SUMMITS FOR THE UNKNOWN PEAKS
IMPASSIONED IT SOUGHT THE LONE UNREALISED TRUTH
IT LONGED FOR THE LIGHT THAT KNOWS NOT DEATH AND BIRTH
EACH STAGE OF THE SOUL'S REMOTE ASCENT WAS BUILT
INTO A CONSTANT HEAVEN FELT ALWAYS HERE
AT EACH PACE OF THE JOURNEY MARVELLOUS
A NEW DEGREE OF WONDER AND OF BLISS
A NEW RUNG FORMED IN BEING'S MIGHTY STAIR
A GREAT WIDE STEP TREMBLING WITH JEWELLED FIRE
AS IF A BURNING SPIRIT QUIVERED THERE
UPHOLDING WITH HIS FLAME THE IMMORTAL HOPE
AS IF A RADIANT GOD HAD GIVEN HIS SOUL
THAT HE MIGHT FEEL THE TREAD OF PILGRIM FEET
MOUNTING IN HASTE TO THE ETERNAL'S HOUSE
AT EITHER END OF EACH EFFULGENT STAIR
THE HEAVENS OF THE IDEAL MIND WERE SEEN
IN A BLUE LUCENCY OF DREAMING SPACE
LIKE STRIPS OF BRILLIANT SKY CLINGING TO THE MOON
ON ONE SIDE GLIMMERED HUE ON FLOATING HUE
A GLORY OF SUNRISE BREAKING ON THE SOUL
IN A TREMULOUS RAPTURE OF THE HEART'S INSIGHT
AND THE SPONTANEOUS BLISS THAT BEAUTY GIVES
THE LOVELY KINGDOMS OF THE DEATHLESS ROSE
ABOVE THE SPIRIT CASED IN MORTAL SENSE
ARE SUPERCONSCIOUS REALMS OF HEAVENLY PEACE
BELOW THE INCONSCIENT'S SULLEN DIM ABYSS
278
BETWEEN BEHIND OUR LIFE THE DEATHLESS ROSE
ACROSS THE COVERT AIR THE SPIRIT BREATHES
A BODY OF THE COSMIC BEAUTY AND JOY
UNSEEN UNGUESSED BY THE BLIND SUFFERING WORLD
CLIMBING FROM NATURE'S DEEP SURRENDERED HEART
IT BLOOMS FOR EVER AT THE FEET OF GOD
FED BY LIFE'S SACRIFICIAL MYSTERIES
HERE TOO ITS BUD IS BORN IN HUMAN BREASTS
THEN BY A TOUCH A PRESENCE OR A VOICE
THE WORLD IS TURNED INTO A TEMPLE GROUND
AND ALL DISCLOSES THE UNKNOWN BELOVED
IN AN OUTBURST OF HEAVENLY JOY AND EASE
LIFE YIELDS TO THE DIVINITY WITHIN
AND GIVES THE RAPTURE-OFFERING OF ITS ALL
AND THE SOUL OPENS TO FELICITY
A BLISS IS FELT THAT NEVER CAN WHOLLY CEASE
A SUDDEN MYSTERY OF SECRET GRACE
FLOWERS GOLDENING OUR EARTH OF RED DESIRE
ALL THE HIGH GODS WHO HID THEIR VISAGES
FROM THE SOILED PASSIONATE RITUAL OF OUR HOPES
REVEAL THEIR NAMES AND THEIR UNDYING POWERS
A FIERY STILLNESS WAKES THE SLUMBERING CELLS
A PASSION OF THE FLESH BECOMING SPIRIT
AND MARVELLOUSLY IS FULFILLED AT LAST
THE MIRACLE FOR WHICH OUR LIFE WAS MADE
A FLAME IN A WHITE VOICELESS CUPOLA
IS SEEN AND FACES OF IMMORTAL LIGHT
THE RADIANT LIMBS THAT KNOW NOT BIRTH AND DEATH
THE BREASTS THAT SUCKLE THE FIRST-BORN OF THE SUN
THE WINGS THAT CROWD THOUGHT'S ARDENT SILENCES
THE EYES THAT LOOK INTO SPIRITUAL SPACE
OUR HIDDEN CENTRES OF CELESTIAL FORCE
OPEN LIKE FLOWERS TO A HEAVENLY ATMOSPHERE
MIND PAUSES THRILLED WITH THE SUPERNAL RAY
AND EVEN THIS TRANSIENT BODY THEN CAN FEEL
IDEAL LOVE AND FLAWLESS HAPPINESS
279
AND LAUGHTER OF THE HEART'S SWEETNESS AND DELIGHT
FREED FROM THE RUDE AND TRAGIC HOLD OF TIME
AND BEAUTY AND THE RHYTHMIC FEET OF THE HOURS
THIS IN HIGH REALMS TOUCHES IMMORTAL KIND
WHAT HERE IS IN THE BUD HAS BLOSSOMED THERE
THERE IS THE SECRECY OF THE HOUSE OF FLAME
THE BLAZE OF GODLIKE THOUGHT AND GOLDEN BLISS
THE RAPT IDEALISM OF HEAVENLY SENSE
THERE ARE THE WONDERFUL VOICES THE SUN-LAUGH
A GURGLING EDDY IN RIVERS OF GOD'S JOY
AND THE MYSTERIED VINEYARDS OF THE GOLD MOON-WINE
ALL THE FIRE AND SWEETNESS OF WHICH HARDLY HERE
A B RILLIANT SHADOW VISITS MORTAL LIFE
ALTHOUGH ARE WITNESSED THERE THE JOYS OF TIME
PRESSED ON THE BOSOM THE IMMORTAL'S TOUCH IS FELT
HEARD ARE THE FLUTINGS OF THE INFINITE
HERE UPON EARTH ARE EARLY AWAKENINGS
MOMENTS THAT TREMBLE IN AN AIR DIVINE
AND GROWN UPON THE YEARNING OF HER SOIL
TIME'S SUN-FLOWERS' GAZE AT GOLD ETERNITY
THERE ARE THE IMPERISHABLE BEATITUDES
A MILLION LOTUSES SWAYING ON ONE STEM
WORLD AFTER COLOURED AND ECSTATIC WORLD
CLIMBS TOWARDS SOME FAR UNSEEN EPIPHANY
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ETERNAL STAIRS
THE MIGHTY KINGDOMS OF THE DEATHLESS FLAME
ASPIRED TO REACH THE BEING'S ABSOLUTES
OUT OF THE SORROW AND DARKNESS OF THE WORLD
OUT OF THE DEPTHS WHERE LIFE AND THOUGHT ARE TOMBED
LONELY MOUNTS UP TO HEAVEN THE DEATHLESS FLAME
IN A VEILED NATURE'S HALLOWED SECRECIES
IT BURNS FOR EVER ON THE ALTAR MIND
ITS PRIESTS THE SOULS OF DEDICATED GODS
HUMANITY ITS HOUSE OF SACRIFICE
ONCE KINDLED NEVER CAN ITS FLAMINGS CEASE
A FIRE ALONG THE MYSTIC PATHS OF EARTH
280
IT RISES THROUGH THE MORTAL'S HEMISPHERE
TILL BORNE BY RUNNERS OF THE DAY AND DUSK
IT ENTERS THE OCCULT ETERNAL LIGHT
AND CLAMBERS WHITENING TO THE INVISIBLE THRONE
ITS WORLDS ARE STEPS OF AN ASCENDING FORCE
A DREAM OF GIANT CONTOURS TITAN LINES
HOMES OF UNFALLEN AND ILLUMINED MIGHT
HEAVENS OF UNCHANGING GOOD PURE AND UNBORN
HEIGHTS OF THE GRANDEUR OF TRUTH'S AGELESS RAY
AS IN A SYMBOL SKY THEY START TO VIEW
AND CALL OUR SOULS INTO A VASTER AIR
ON THEIR SUMMITS THEY BEAR UP THE SLEEPLESS FLAME
DREAMING OF A MYSTERIOUS BEYOND
TRANSCENDENT OF THE PATHS OF FATE AND TIME
THEY POINT ABOVE THEMSELVES WITH INDEX PEAKS
THROUGH A PALE-SAPPHIRE ETHER OF GOD-MIND
TOWARDS SOME GOLD INFINITE'S APOCALYPSE
A THUNDER ROLLING MID THE HILLS OF GOD
TIRELESS SEVERE IS THEIR TREMENDOUS VOICE
EXCEEDING US TO EXCEED OURSELVES THEY CALL
AND BID US RISE INCESSANTLY ABOVE
FAR FROM OUR EAGER REACH THOSE SUMMITS LIVE
TOO LOFTY FOR OUR MORTAL STRENGTH AND HEIGHT
HARDLY IN A DIRE ECSTASY OF TOIL
CLIMBED BY THE SPIRIT'S NAKED ATHLETE WILL
AUSTERE INTOLERANT THEY CLAIM FROM US
EFFORTS TOO LASTING FOR OUR MORTAL NERVE
OUR HEARTS CANNOT CLEAVE TO NOR OUR FLESH SUPPORT
ONLY THE ETERNAL'S STRENGTH IN US CAN DARE
TO ATTEMPT THE IMMENSE ADVENTURE OF THAT CLIMB
AND THE SACRIFICE OF ALL WE CHERISH HERE
OUR HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IS A CANDLE BURNT
ON A DIM ALTAR TO A SUN-VAST TRUTH
MAN'S VIRTUE A COARSE-SPUN ILL-FITTING DRESS
APPARELS WOODEN IMAGES OF GOOD
PASSIONATE AND BLINDED BLEEDING STAINED WITH MIRE
281
HIS ENERGY STUMBLES TOWARDS A DEATHLESS FORCE
AN IMPERFECTION DOGS OUR HIGHEST STRENGTH
PORTIONS AND PALE REFLECTIONS ARE OUR SHARE
HAPPY THE WORLDS THAT HAVE NOT FELT OUR FALL
WHERE WILL IS ONE WITH TRUTH AND GOOD WITH POWER
IMPOVERISHED NOT BY EARTH-MIND'S INDIGENCE
THEY KEEP GOD'S NATURAL BREATH OF MIGHTINESS
HIS BARE SPONTANEOUS SWIFT INTENSITIES
THERE IS HIS GREAT TRANSPARENT MIRROR SELF
AND THERE HIS SOVEREIGN AUTARCHY OF BLISS
IN WHICH IMMORTAL NATURES HAVE THEIR PART
HEIRS AND COSHARERS OF DIVINITY
HE THROUGH THE IDEAL'S KINGDOMS MOVED AT WILL
ACCEPTED THEIR BEAUTY AND THEIR GREATNESS BORE
PARTOOK OF THE GLORIES OF THEIR WONDER FIELDS
BUT PASSED NOR STAYED BENEATH THEIR SPLENDOUR'S RULE
ALL THERE WAS AN INTENSE BUT PARTIAL LIGHT
IN EACH A SERAPH-WINGED HIGH-BROWED IDEA
UNITED ALL KNOWLEDGE BY ONE MASTER THOUGHT
PERSUADED ALL ACTION TO ONE GOLDEN SENSE
ALL POWERS SUBJECTED TO A SINGLE POWER
AND MADE A WORLD WHERE IT COULD REIGN ALONE
AN ABSOLUTE IDEAL'S PERFECT HOME
INSIGNIA OF THEIR VICTORY AND THEIR FAITH
THEY OFFERED TO THE TRAVELLER AT THEIR GATES
A QUENCHLESS FLAME OR AN UNFADING FLOWER
EMBLEM OF A HIGH KINGDOM'S PRIVILEGE
A GLORIOUS SHINING ANGEL OF THE WAY
PRESENTED TO THE SEEKING OF THE SOUL
THE SWEETNESS AND THE MIGHT OF AN IDEA
EACH DEEMED TRUTH'S INTIMATE FOUNT AND SUMMIT FORCE
THE HEART OF THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE
PERFECTION'S KEY PASSPORT TO PARADISE
YET WERE THERE REGIONS WHERE THESE ABSOLUTES MET
AND MADE A CIRCLE OF BLISS WITH MARRIED HANDS
LIGHT STOOD EMBRACED BY LIGHT FIRE WEDDED FIRE
282
BUT NONE IN THE OTHER WOULD HIS BODY LOSE
TO FIND HIS SOUL IN THE WORLD'S SINGLE SOUL
A MULTIPLIED RAPTURE OF INFINITY
ONWARD HE PASSED TO A DIVINER SPHERE
THERE JOINED IN A COMMON GREATNESS LIGHT AND BLISS
ALL HIGH AND BEAUTIFUL AND DESIRABLE POWERS
FORGETTING THEIR DIFFERENCE AND THEIR SEPARATE REIGN
BECOME A SINGLE MULTITUDINOUS WHOLE
ABOVE THE PARTING OF THE ROADS OF TIME
ABOVE THE SILENCE AND ITS THOUSANDFOLD WORD
IN THE IMMUTABLE AND INVIOLATE TRUTH
FOR EVER UNITED AND INSEPARABLE
THE RADIANT CHILDREN OF ETERNITY DWELL
ON THE WIDE SPIRIT HEIGHT WHERE ALL ARE ONE
283
AT LAST THERE CAME A BARE INDIFFERENT SKY
WHERE SILENCE LISTENED TO THE COSMIC VOICE
BUT ANSWERED NOTHING TO A MILLION CALLS
THE SOUL'S ENDLESS QUESTION MET WITH NO RESPONSE
AN ABRUPT CONCLUSION ENDED EAGER HOPES
A DEEP CESSATION IN A MIGHTY CALM
A FINIS-LINE ON THE LAST PAGE OF THOUGHT
AND A MARGIN AND A BLANK OF WORDLESS PEACE
THERE PAUSED THE CLIMBING HIERARCHY OF WORLDS
HE STOOD ON A WIDE ARC OF SUMMIT SPACE
ALONE WITH AN ENORMOUS SELF OF MIND
WHICH HELD ALL LIFE IN A CORNER OF ITS VASTS
OMNIPOTENT IMMOBILE AND ALOOF
IN THE WORLD WHICH SPRANG FROM IT IT TOOK NO PART
IT GAVE NO HEED TO THE PAEANS OF VICTORY
IT WAS INDIFFERENT TO ITS OWN DEFEATS
IT HEARD THE CRY OF GRIEF AND MADE NO SIGN
IMPARTIAL FELL ITS GAZE ON EVIL AND GOOD
IT SAW DESTRUCTION COME AND DID NOT MOVE
AN EQUAL CAUSE OF THINGS A LONELY SEER
AND MASTER OF ITS MULTITUDE OF FORMS
IT ACTED NOT BUT BORE ALL THOUGHTS AND DEEDS
THE WITNESS LORD OF NATURE'S MYRIAD ACTS
CONSENTING TO THE MOVEMENTS OF HER FORCE
HIS MIND REFLECTED THIS VAST QUIETISM
THIS WITNESS HUSH IS THE THINKER'S SECRET BASE
HIDDEN IN SILENT DEPTHS THE WORD IS FORMED
FROM HIDDEN SILENCES THE ACT IS BORN
INTO THE VOICEFUL MIND THE LABOURING WORLD
IN SECRECY WRAPS THE SEED THE ETERNAL SOWS
SILENCE THE MYSTIC BIRTHPLACE OF THE SOUL
284
IN GOD'S SUPREME WITHDRAWN AND TIMELESS HUSH
A SEEING SELF AND POTENT ENERGY MET
THE SILENCE KNEW ITSELF AND THOUGHT TOOK FORM
SELF-MADE FROM THE DUAL POWER CREATION ROSE
IN THE STILL SELF HE LIVED AND IT IN HIM
ITS MUTE IMMEMORABLE LISTENING DEPTHS
ITS VASTNESS AND ITS STILLNESS WERE HIS OWN
ONE BEING WITH IT HE GREW WIDE POWERFUL FREE
APART UNBOUND HE LOOKED ON ALL THINGS DONE
AS ONE WHO BUILDS HIS OWN IMAGINED SCENES
AND LOSES NOT HIMSELF IN WHAT HE SEES
SPECTATOR OF A DRAMA SELF-CONCEIVED
HE LOOKED ON THE WORLD AND WATCHED ITS MOTIVE THOUGHTS
WITH THE BURDEN OF LUMINOUS PROPHECY IN THEIR EYES
ITS FORCES WITH THEIR FEET OF WIND AND FIRE
ARISEN FROM THE DUMBNESS IN HIS SOUL
ALL NOW HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND AND KNOW
DESIRE CAME NOT NOR ANY GUST OF WILL
THE GREAT PERTURBED INQUIRER LOST HIS TASK
NOTHING WAS ASKED NOR WANTED ANY MORE
THERE HE COULD STAY THE SELF THE SILENCE WON
HIS SOUL HAD PEACE IT KNEW THE COSMIC WHOLE
THEN SUDDENLY A LUMINOUS FINGER FELL
ON ALL THINGS SEEN OR TOUCHED OR HEARD OR FELT
AND SHOWED HIS MIND THAT NOTHING COULD BE KNOWN
THAT MUST BE REACHED FROM WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES
THE SCEPTIC RAY DISRUPTED ALL THAT SEEMS
AND SMOTE AT THE VERY ROOTS OF THOUGHT AND SENSE
IN A UNIVERSE OF NESCIENCE THEY HAVE GROWN
ASPIRING TOWARDS A SUPERCONSCIENT SUN
PLAYING IN SHINE AND RAIN FROM HEAVENLIER SKIES
THEY NEVER CAN WIN HOWEVER HIGH THEIR REACH
OR OVERPASS HOWEVER KEEN THEIR PROBE
A DOUBT CORRODED EVEN THE MEANS TO THINK
DISTRUST WAS THROWN UPON MIND'S INSTRUMENTS
ALL THAT IT TAKES FOR REALITY'S SHINING COIN
285
PROVED FACT FIXED INFERENCE DEDUCTION CLEAR
FIRM THEORY ASSURED SIGNIFICANCE
APPEARED AS FRAUDS UPON TIME'S CREDIT BANK
OR ASSETS VALUELESS IN TRUTH'S TREASURY
AN IGNORANCE ON AN UNEASY THRONE
TRAVESTIED WITH A FORTUITOUS SOVEREIGNTY
A FIGURE OF KNOWLEDGE GARBED IN DUBIOUS WORDS
AND TINSEL THOUGHT-FORMS BRIGHTLY INADEQUATE
A LABOURER IN THE DARK DAZZLED BY HALF-LIGHT
WHAT IT KNEW WAS AN IMAGE IN A BROKEN GLASS
WHAT IT SAW WAS REAL BUT ITS SIGHT UNTRUE
ALL THE IDEAS IN ITS VAST REPERTORY
WERE LIKE THE MUTTERINGS OF A TRANSIENT CLOUD
THAT SPENT ITSELF IN SOUND AND LEFT NO TRACE
A FRAIL HOUSE HANGING IN UNCERTAIN AIR
THE THIN INGENIOUS WEB ROUND WHICH IT MOVES
PUT OUT AWHILE ON THE TREE OF THE UNIVERSE
AND GATHERED UP INTO ITSELF AGAIN
WAS ONLY A TRAP TO CATCH LIFE'S INSECT FOOD
WINGED THOUGHTS THAT FLUTTER FRAGILE IN BRIEF LIGHT
BUT DEAD ONCE CAPTURED IN FIXED FORMS OF MIND
AIMS PUNY BUT LOOMING LARGE IN MAN'S SMALL SCALE
FLICKERS OF IMAGINATION'S BRILLIANT GAUZE
AND COBWEB-WRAPPED BELIEFS ALIVE NO MORE
THE MAGIC HUT OF BUILT-UP CERTITUDES
MADE OUT OF GLITTERING DUST AND BRIGHT MOONSHINE
IN WHICH IT SHRINES ITS IMAGE OF THE REAL
COLLAPSED INTO THE NESCIENCE WHENCE IT ROSE
ONLY A GLEAM WAS THERE OF SYMBOL FACTS
THAT SHROUD THE MYSTERY LURKING IN THEIR GLOW
AND FALSEHOODS BASED ON HIDDEN REALITIES
BY WHICH THEY LIVE UNTIL THEY FALL FROM TIME
OUR MIND IS A HOUSE HAUNTED BY THE SLAIN PAST
IDEAS SOON MUMMIFIED GHOSTS OF OLD TRUTHS
GOD'S SPONTANEITIES TIED WITH FORMAL STRINGS
AND PACKED INTO DRAWERS OF REASON'S TRIM BUREAU
286
A GRAVE OF GREAT LOST OPPORTUNITIES
OR AN OFFICE FOR MISUSE OF SOUL AND LIFE
AND ALL THE WASTE MAN MAKES OF HEAVEN'S GIFTS
AND ALL HIS SQUANDERINGS OF NATURE'S STORE
A STAGE FOR THE COMEDY OF IGNORANCE
THE WORLD SEEMED A LONG AEONIC FAILURE'S SCENE
ALL STERILE GREW NO BASE WAS LEFT SECURE
ASSAILED BY THE EDGE OF THE CONVICTING BEAM
THE BUILDER REASON LOST HER CONFIDENCE
IN THE SUCCESSFUL SLEIGHT AND TURN OF THOUGHT
THAT MAKES THE SOUL THE PRISONER OF A PHRASE
ITS HIGHEST WISDOM WAS A BRILLIANT GUESS
ITS MIGHTY STRUCTURED SCIENCE OF THE WORLDS
A PASSING LIGHT ON BEING'S SURFACES
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT A SCHEMA DRAWN BY SENSE
A SUBSTITUTE FOR ETERNAL MYSTERIES
A SCRAWL FIGURE OF REALITY A PLAN
AND ELEVATION BY THE ARCHITECT WORD
IMPOSED UPON THE SEMBLANCES OF TIME
EXISTENCE' SELF WAS SHADOWED BY A DOUBT
ALMOST IT SEEMED A LOTUS-LEAF AFLOAT
ON A NUDE POOL OF COSMIC NOTHINGNESS
THIS GREAT SPECTATOR AND CREATOR MIND
WAS ONLY SOME HALF-SEEING'S DELEGATE
A VEIL THAT HUNG BETWEEN THE SOUL AND LIGHT
AN IDOL NOT THE LIVING BODY OF GOD
EVEN THE STILL SPIRIT THAT LOOKS UPON ITS WORKS
WAS SOME PALE FRONT OF THE UNKNOWABLE
A SHADOW SEEMED THE WIDE AND WITNESS SELF
ITS LIBERATION AND IMMOBILE CALM
A VOID RECOIL OF BEING FROM TIME-MADE THINGS
NOT THE SELF-VISION OF ETERNITY
DEEP PEACE WAS THERE BUT NOT THE NAMELESS FORCE
OUR SWEET AND MIGHTY MOTHER WAS NOT THERE
WHO GATHERS TO HER BOSOM HER CHILDREN'S LIVES
HER CLASP THAT TAKES THE WORLD INTO HER ARMS
287
IN THE FATHOMLESS RAPTURE OF THE INFINITE
THE BLISS THAT IS CREATION'S SPLENDID GRAIN
OR THE WHITE PASSION OF GOD-ECSTASY
THAT LAUGHS IN THE BLAZE OF THE BOUNDLESS HEART OF LOVE
A GREATER SPIRIT THAN THE SELF OF MIND
MUST ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONING OF HIS SOUL
FOR HERE WAS NO FIRM CLUE AND NO SURE ROAD
HIGH-CLIMBING PATHWAYS CEASED IN THE UNKNOWN
AN ARTIST SIGHT CONSTRUCTED THE BEYOND
IN CONTRARY PATTERNS AND CONFLICTING HUES
A PART-EXPERIENCE FRAGMENTED THE WHOLE
HE LOOKED ABOVE BUT ALL WAS BLANK AND STILL
A SAPPHIRE FIRMAMENT OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT
ESCAPED INTO A FORMLESS VACANCY
HE LOOKED BELOW BUT ALL WAS DARK AND MUTE
A NOISE WAS HEARD BETWEEN OF THOUGHT AND PRAYER
A STRIFE A LABOUR WITHOUT END OR PAUSE
A VAIN AND IGNORANT SEEKING RAISED ITS VOICE
A RUMOUR AND A MOVEMENT AND A CALL
A FOAMING MASS A CRY INNUMERABLE
ROLLED EVER UPON THE OCEAN SURGE OF LIFE
ALONG THE COASTS OF MORTAL IGNORANCE
ON ITS UNSTABLE AND ENORMOUS BREAST
BEINGS AND FORCES FORMS IDEAS LIKE WAVES
JOSTLED FOR FIGURE AND SUPREMACY
AND ROSE AND SANK AND ROSE AGAIN IN TIME
AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLEEPLESS STIR
A NOTHINGNESS PARENT OF THE STRUGGLING WORLDS
A HUGE CREATOR DEATH A MYSTIC VOID
FOR EVER SUSTAINING THE IRRATIONAL CRY
FOR EVER EXCLUDING THE SUPERNAL WORD
MOTIONLESS REFUSING QUESTION AND RESPONSE
REPOSED BENEATH THE VOICES AND THE MARCH
THE DIM INCONSCIENT'S DUMB INCERTITUDE
TWO FIRMAMENTS OF DARKNESS AND OF LIGHT
OPPOSED THEIR LIMITS TO THE SPIRIT'S WALK
288
IT MOVED VEILED IN FROM SELF'S INFINITY
IN A WORLD OF BEINGS AND MOMENTARY EVENTS
WHERE ALL MUST DIE TO LIVE AND LIVE TO DIE
IMMORTAL BY RENEWED MORTALITY
IT WANDERED IN THE SPIRAL OF ITS ACTS
OR RAN AROUND THE CYCLES OF ITS THOUGHT
YET WAS NO MORE THAN ITS ORIGINAL SELF
AND KNEW NO MORE THAN WHEN IT FIRST BEGAN
TO BE WAS A PRISON EXTINCTION THE ESCAPE
289
A COVERT ANSWER TO HIS SEEKING CAME
IN A FAR SHIMMERING BACKGROUND OF MIND-SPACE
A GLOWING MOUTH WAS SEEN A LUMINOUS SHAFT
A RECLUSE GATE IT SEEMED MUSING ON JOY
A VEILED RETREAT AND ESCAPE TO MYSTERY
AWAY FROM THE UNSATISFIED SURFACE WORLD
IT FLED INTO THE BOSOM OF THE UNKNOWN
A WELL A TUNNEL OF THE DEPTHS OF GOD
IT PLUNGED AS IF A MYSTIC GROOVE OF HOPE
THROUGH MANY LAYERS OF FORMLESS VOICELESS SELF
TO REACH THE LAST PROFOUND OF THE WORLD'S HEART
AND FROM THAT HEART THERE SURGED A WORDLESS CALL
PLEADING WITH SOME STILL IMPENETRABLE MIND
VOICING SOME PASSIONATE UNSEEN DESIRE
AS IF A BECKONING FINGER OF SECRECY
OUTSTRETCHED INTO A CRYSTAL MOOD OF AIR
POINTING AT HIM FROM SOME NEAR HIDDEN DEPTH
AS IF A MESSAGE FROM THE WORLD'S DEEP SOUL
AN INTIMATION OF A LURKING JOY
THAT FLOWED OUT FROM A CUP OF BROODING BLISS
THERE SHIMMERED STEALING OUT INTO THE MIND
A MUTE AND QUIVERING ECSTASY OF LIGHT
A PASSION AND DELICACY OF ROSEATE FIRE
AS ONE DRAWN TO HIS LOST SPIRITUAL HOME
FEELS NOW THE CLOSENESS OF A WAITING LOVE
INTO A PASSAGE DIM AND TREMULOUS
THAT CLASPED HIM IN FROM DAY AND NIGHT'S PURSUIT
HE TRAVELLED LED BY A MYSTERIOUS SOUND
A MURMUR MULTITUDINOUS AND LONE
ALL SOUNDS IT WAS IN TURN YET STILL THE SAME
A HIDDEN CALL TO UNFORESEEN DELIGHT
290
IN THE SUMMONING VOICE OF ONE LONG-KNOWN WELL-LOVED
BUT NAMELESS TO THE UNREMEMBERING MIND
IT LED TO RAPTURE BACK THE TRUANT HEART
THE IMMORTAL CRY RAVISHED THE CAPTIVE EAR
THEN LOWERING ITS IMPERIOUS MYSTERY
IT SANK TO A WHISPER CIRCLING ROUND THE SOUL
IT SEEMED THE YEARNING OF A LONELY FLUTE
THAT ROAMED ALONG THE SHORES OF MEMORY
AND FILLED THE EYES WITH TEARS OF LONGING JOY
A CRICKET'S RASH AND FIERY SINGLE NOTE
IT MARKED WITH SHRILL MELODY NIGHT'S MOONLESS HUSH
AND BEAT UPON A NERVE OF MYSTIC SLEEP
ITS HIGH INSISTENT MAGICAL REVEILLE
A JINGLING SILVER LAUGH OF ANKLET BELLS
TRAVELLED THE ROADS OF A SOLITARY HEART
ITS DANCE SOLACED AN ETERNAL LONELINESS
AN OLD FORGOTTEN SWEETNESS SOBBING CAME
OR FROM A FAR HARMONIOUS DISTANCE HEARD
THE TINKLING PACE OF A LONG CARAVAN
IT SEEMED AT TIMES OR A VAST FOREST'S HYMN
THE SOLEMN REMINDER OF A TEMPLE GONG
A BEE-CROON HONEY-DRUNK IN SUMMER ISLES
ARDENT WITH ECSTASY IN A SLUMBROUS NOON
OR THE FAR ANTHEM OF A PILGRIM SEA
AN INCENSE FLOATED IN THE QUIVERING AIR
A MYSTIC HAPPINESS TREMBLED IN THE BREAST
AS IF THE INVISIBLE BELOVED HAD COME
ASSUMING THE SUDDEN LOVELINESS OF A FACE
AND CLOSE GLAD HANDS COULD SEIZE HIS FUGITIVE FEET
AND THE WORLD CHANGE WITH THE BEAUTY OF A SMILE
INTO A WONDERFUL BODILESS REALM HE CAME
THE HOME OF A PASSION WITHOUT NAME OR VOICE
A DEPTH HE FELT ANSWERING TO EVERY HEIGHT
A NOOK WAS FOUND THAT COULD EMBRACE ALL WORLDS
A POINT THAT WAS THE CONSCIOUS KNOT OF SPACE
AN HOUR ETERNAL IN THE HEART OF TIME
291
THE SILENT SOUL OF ALL THE WORLD WAS THERE
A BEING LIVED A PRESENCE AND A POWER
A SINGLE PERSON WHO WAS HIMSELF AND ALL
AND CHERISHED NATURE'S SWEET AND DANGEROUS THROBS
TRANSFIGURED INTO BEATS DIVINE AND PURE
ONE WHO COULD LOVE WITHOUT RETURN FOR LOVE
MEETING AND TURNING TO THE BEST THE WORST
IT HEALED THE BITTER CRUELTIES OF EARTH
TRANSFORMING ALL EXPERIENCE TO DELIGHT
INTERVENING IN THE SORROWFUL PATHS OF BIRTH
IT ROCKED THE CRADLE OF THE COSMIC CHILD
AND STILLED ALL WEEPING WITH ITS HAND OF JOY
IT LED THINGS EVIL TOWARDS THEIR SECRET GOOD
IT TURNED RACKED FALSEHOOD INTO HAPPY TRUTH
ITS POWER WAS TO REVEAL DIVINITY
INFINITE COEVAL WITH THE MIND OF GOD
IT BORE WITHIN ITSELF A SEED A FLAME
A SEED FROM WHICH THE ETERNAL IS NEW-BORN
A FLAME THAT CANCELS DEATH IN MORTAL THINGS
ALL GREW TO ALL KINDRED AND SELF AND NEAR
THE INTIMACY OF GOD WAS EVERYWHERE
NO VEIL WAS FELT NO BRUTE BARRIER INERT
DISTANCE COULD NOT DIVIDE TIME COULD NOT CHANGE
A FIRE OF PASSION BURNED IN SPIRIT-DEPTHS
A CONSTANT TOUCH OF SWEETNESS LINKED ALL HEARTS
THE THROB OF ONE ADORATION'S SINGLE BLISS
IN A RAPT ETHER OF UNDYING LOVE
AN INNER HAPPINESS ABODE IN ALL
A SENSE OF UNIVERSAL HARMONIES
A MEASURELESS SECURE ETERNITY
OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY AND GOOD AND JOY MADE ONE
HERE WAS THE WELLING CORE OF FINITE LIFE
A FORMLESS SPIRIT BECAME THE SOUL OF FORM
ALL THERE WAS SOUL OR MADE OF SHEER SOUL-STUFF
A SKY OF SOUL COVERED A DEEP SOUL-GROUND
292
ALL HERE WAS KNOWN BY A SPIRITUAL SENSE
THOUGHT WAS NOT THERE BUT A KNOWLEDGE NEAR AND ONE
SEIZED ON ALL THINGS BY A MOVED IDENTITY
A SYMPATHY OF SELF WITH OTHER SELVES
THE TOUCH OF CONSCIOUSNESS ON CONSCIOUSNESS
AND BEING'S LOOK ON BEING WITH INMOST GAZE
AND HEART LAID BARE TO HEART WITHOUT WALLS OF SPEECH
AND THE UNANIMITY OF SEEING MINDS
IN MYRIAD FORMS LUMINOUS WITH THE ONE GOD
LIFE WAS NOT THERE BUT AN IMPASSIONED FORCE
FINER THAN FINENESS DEEPER THAN THE DEEPS
FELT AS A SUBTLE AND SPIRITUAL POWER
A Q UIVERING OUT FROM SOUL TO ANSWERING SOUL
A MYSTIC MOVEMENT A CLOSE INFLUENCE
A FREE AND HAPPY AND INTENSE APPROACH
OF BEING TO BEING WITH NO SCREEN OR CHECK
WITHOUT WHICH LIFE AND LOVE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
BODY WAS NOT THERE FOR BODIES WERE NEEDED NOT
THE SOUL ITSELF WAS ITS OWN DEATHLESS FORM
AND MET AT ONCE THE TOUCH OF OTHER SOULS
CLOSE BLISSFUL CONCRETE WONDERFULLY TRUE
AS WHEN ONE WALKS IN SLEEP THROUGH LUMINOUS DREAMS
AND CONSCIOUS KNOWS THE TRUTH THEIR FIGURES MEAN
HERE WHERE REALITY WAS ITS OWN DREAM
HE KNEW THINGS BY THEIR SOUL AND NOT THEIR SHAPE
AS THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED LONG MADE ONE IN LOVE
NEED WORD NOR SIGN FOR HEART'S REPLY TO HEART
HE MET AND COMMUNED WITHOUT BAR OF SPEECH
WITH BEINGS UNVEILED BY A MATERIAL FRAME
THERE WAS A STRANGE SPIRITUAL SCENERY
A LOVELINESS OF LAKES AND STREAMS AND HILLS
A FLOW A FIXITY IN A SOUL-SPACE
AND PLAINS AND VALLEYS STRETCHES OF SOUL-JOY
AND GARDENS THAT WERE FLOWER-TRACTS OF THE SPIRIT
ITS MEDITATIONS OF TINGED REVERIE
AIR WAS THE BREATH OF A PURE INFINITE
293
A FRAGRANCE WANDERED IN A COLOURED HAZE
AS IF THE SCENT AND HUE OF ALL SWEET FLOWERS
HAD MINGLED TO COPY HEAVEN'S ATMOSPHERE
APPEALING TO THE SOUL AND NOT THE EYE
BEAUTY LIVED THERE AT HOME IN HER OWN HOUSE
THERE ALL WAS BEAUTIFUL BY ITS OWN RIGHT
AND NEEDED NOT THE SPLENDOUR OF A ROBE
ALL OBJECTS WERE LIKE BODIES OF THE GODS
A SPIRIT SYMBOL ENVIRONING A SOUL
FOR WORLD AND SELF WERE ONE REALITY
IMMERSED IN VOICELESS INTERNATAL TRANCE
THE BEINGS THAT ONCE WORE FORMS ON EARTH SAT THERE
IN SHINING CHAMBERS OF SPIRITUAL SLEEP
PASSED WERE THE PILLAR-POSTS OF BIRTH AND DEATH
PASSED WAS THEIR LITTLE SCENE OF SYMBOL DEEDS
PASSED WERE THE HEAVENS AND HELLS OF THEIR LONG ROAD
THEY HAD RETURNED INTO THE WORLD'S DEEP SOUL
ALL NOW WAS GATHERED INTO PREGNANT REST
PERSON AND NATURE SUFFERED A SLUMBER CHANGE
IN TRANCE THEY GATHERED BACK THEIR BYGONE SELVES
IN A BACKGROUND MEMORY'S FORESEEING MUSE
PROPHETIC OF NEW PERSONALITY
ARRANGED THE MAP OF THEIR COMING DESTINY'S COURSE
HEIRS OF THEIR PAST THEIR FUTURE'S DISCOVERERS
ELECTORS OF THEIR OWN SELF-CHOSEN LOT
THEY WAITED FOR THE ADVENTURE OF NEW LIFE
A PERSON PERSISTENT THROUGH THE LAPSE OF WORLDS
ALTHOUGH THE SAME FOR EVER IN MANY SHAPES
BY THE OUTWARD MIND UNRECOGNISABLE
ASSUMING NAMES UNKNOWN IN UNKNOWN CLIMES
IMPRINTS THROUGH TIME UPON THE EARTH'S WORN PAGE
A GROWING FIGURE OF ITS SECRET SELF
AND LEARNS BY EXPERIENCE WHAT THE SPIRIT KNEW
TILL IT CAN SEE ITS TRUTH ALIVE AND GOD
ONCE MORE THEY MUST FACE THE PROBLEM-GAME OF BIRTH
294
THE SOUL'S EXPERIMENT OF JOY AND GRIEF
AND THOUGHT AND IMPULSE LIGHTING THE BLIND ACT
AND VENTURE ON THE ROADS OF CIRCUMSTANCE
THROUGH INNER MOVEMENTS AND EXTERNAL SCENES
TRAVELLING TO SELF ACROSS THE FORMS OF THINGS
INTO CREATION'S CENTRE HE HAD COME
THE SPIRIT WANDERING FROM STATE TO STATE
FINDS HERE THE SILENCE OF ITS STARTING-POINT
IN THE FORMLESS FORCE AND THE STILL FIXITY
AND BROODING PASSION OF THE WORLD OF SOUL
ALL THAT IS MADE AND ONCE AGAIN UNMADE
THE CALM PERSISTENT VISION OF THE ONE
INEVITABLY RE-MAKES IT LIVES ANEW
FORCES AND LIVES AND BEINGS AND IDEAS
ARE TAKEN INTO THE STILLNESS FOR A WHILE
THERE THEY REMOULD THEIR PURPOSE AND THEIR DRIFT
RECAST THEIR NATURE AND RE-FORM THEIR SHAPE
EVER THEY CHANGE AND CHANGING EVER GROW
AND PASSING THROUGH A FRUITFUL STAGE OF DEATH
AND AFTER LONG RECONSTITUTING SLEEP
RESUME THEIR PLACE IN THE PROCESS OF THE GODS
UNTIL THEIR WORK IN COSMIC TIME IS DONE
HERE WAS THE FASHIONING CHAMBER OF THE WORLDS
AN INTERVAL WAS LEFT TWIXT ACT AND ACT
TWIXT BIRTH AND BIRTH TWIXT DREAM AND WAKING DREAM
A PAUSE THAT GAVE NEW STRENGTH TO DO AND BE
BEYOND WERE REGIONS OF DELIGHT AND PEACE
MUTE BIRTHPLACES OF LIGHT AND HOPE AND LOVE
AND CRADLES OF HEAVENLY RAPTURE AND REPOSE
IN A SLUMBER OF THE VOICES OF THE WORLD
HE OF THE ETERNAL MOMENT GREW AWARE
HIS KNOWLEDGE STRIPPED BARE OF THE GARBS OF SENSE
KNEW BY IDENTITY WITHOUT THOUGHT OR WORD
HIS BEING SAW ITSELF WITHOUT ITS VEILS
LIFE'S LINE FELL FROM THE SPIRIT'S INFINITY
ALONG A ROAD OF PURE INTERIOR LIGHT
295
ALONE BETWEEN TREMENDOUS PRESENCES
UNDER THE WATCHING EYES OF NAMELESS GODS
HIS SOUL PASSED ON A SINGLE CONSCIOUS POWER
TOWARDS THE END WHICH EVER BEGINS AGAIN
APPROACHING THROUGH A STILLNESS DUMB AND CALM
TO THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS HUMAN AND DIVINE
THERE HE BEHELD IN THEIR MIGHTY UNION'S POISE
THE FIGURE OF THE DEATHLESS TWO-IN-ONE
A SINGLE BEING IN TWO BODIES CLASPED
A DIARCHY OF TWO UNITED SOULS
SEATED ABSORBED IN DEEP CREATIVE JOY
THEIR TRANCE OF BLISS SUSTAINED THE MOBILE WORLD
BEHIND THEM IN A MORNING DUSK ONE STOOD
WHO BROUGHT THEM FORTH FROM THE UNKNOWABLE
EVER DISGUISED SHE AWAITS THE SEEKING SPIRIT
WATCHER ON THE SUPREME UNREACHABLE PEAKS
GUIDE OF THE TRAVELLER OF THE UNSEEN PATHS
SHE GUARDS THE AUSTERE APPROACH TO THE ALONE
AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH FAR-SPREAD PLANE
PERVADING WITH HER POWER THE COSMIC SUNS
SHE REIGNS INSPIRER OF ITS MULTIPLE WORKS
AND THINKER OF THE SYMBOL OF ITS SCENE
ABOVE THEM ALL SHE STANDS SUPPORTING ALL
THE SOLE OMNIPOTENT GODDESS EVER-VEILED
OF WHOM THE WORLD IS THE INSCRUTABLE MASK
THE AGES ARE THE FOOTFALLS OF HER TREAD
THEIR HAPPENINGS THE FIGURE OF HER THOUGHTS
AND ALL CREATION IS HER ENDLESS ACT
HIS SPIRIT WAS MADE A VESSEL OF HER FORCE
MUTE IN THE FATHOMLESS PASSION OF HIS WILL
HE OUTSTRETCHED TO HER HIS FOLDED HANDS OF PRAYER
THEN IN A SOVEREIGN ANSWER TO HIS HEART
A GESTURE CAME AS OF WORLDS THROWN AWAY
AND FROM HER RAIMENT'S LUSTROUS MYSTERY RAISED
ONE ARM HALF-PARTED THE ETERNAL VEIL
A LIGHT APPEARED STILL AND IMPERISHABLE
296
ATTRACTED TO THE LARGE AND LUMINOUS DEPTHS
OF THE RAVISHING ENIGMA OF HER EYES
HE SAW THE MYSTIC OUTLINE OF A FACE
OVERWHELMED BY HER IMPLACABLE LIGHT AND BLISS
AN ATOM OF HER ILLIMITABLE SELF
MASTERED BY THE HONEY AND LIGHTNING OF HER POWER
TOSSED TOWARDS THE SHORES OF HER OCEAN-ECSTASY
DRUNK WITH A DEEP GOLDEN SPIRITUAL WINE
HE CAST FROM THE RENT STILLNESS OF HIS SOUL
A CRY OF ADORATION AND DESIRE
AND THE SURRENDER OF HIS BOUNDLESS MIND
AND THE SELF-GIVING OF HIS SILENT HEART
HE FELL DOWN AT HER FEET UNCONSCIOUS PRONE
297
AFTER A MEASURELESS MOMENT OF THE SOUL
AGAIN RETURNING TO THESE SURFACE FIELDS
OUT OF THE TIMELESS DEPTHS WHERE HE HAD SUNK
HE HEARD ONCE MORE THE SLOW TREAD OF THE HOURS
ALL ONCE PERCEIVED AND LIVED WAS FAR AWAY
HIMSELF WAS TO HIMSELF HIS ONLY SCENE
ABOVE THE WITNESS AND HIS UNIVERSE
HE STOOD IN A REALM OF BOUNDLESS SILENCES
AWAITING THE VOICE THAT SPOKE AND BUILT THE WORLDS
A LIGHT WAS ROUND HIM WIDE AND ABSOLUTE
A DIAMOND PURITY OF ETERNAL SIGHT
A CONSCIOUSNESS LAY STILL DEVOID OF FORMS
FREE WORDLESS UNCOERCED BY SIGN OR RULE
FOR EVER CONTENT WITH ONLY BEING AND BLISS
A SHEER EXISTENCE LIVED IN ITS OWN PEACE
ON THE SINGLE SPIRIT'S BARE AND INFINITE GROUND
OUT OF THE SPHERE OF MIND HE HAD ARISEN
HE HAD LEFT THE REIGN OF NATURE'S HUES AND SHADES
HE DWELT IN HIS SELF'S COLOURLESS PURITY
IT WAS A PLANE OF UNDETERMINED SPIRIT
THAT COULD BE A ZERO OR ROUND SUM OF THINGS
A STATE IN WHICH ALL CEASED AND ALL BEGAN
ALL IT BECAME THAT FIGURES THE ABSOLUTE
A H IGH VAST PEAK WHENCE SPIRIT COULD SEE THE WORLDS
CALM'S WIDE EPIPHANY WISDOM'S MUTE HOME
A LONELY STATION OF OMNISCIENCE
A DIVING-BOARD OF THE ETERNAL'S POWER
A WHITE FLOOR IN THE HOUSE OF ALL-DELIGHT
HERE CAME THE THOUGHT THAT PASSES BEYOND THOUGHT
HERE THE STILL VOICE WHICH OUR LISTENING CANNOT HEAR
THE KNOWLEDGE BY WHICH THE KNOWER IS THE KNOWN
298
THE LOVE IN WHICH BELOVED AND LOVER ARE ONE
ALL STOOD IN AN ORIGINAL PLENITUDE
HUSHED AND FULFILLED BEFORE THEY COULD CREATE
THE GLORIOUS DREAM OF THEIR UNIVERSAL ACTS
HERE WAS ENGENDERED THE SPIRITUAL BIRTH
HERE CLOSED THE FINITE'S CRAWL TO THE INFINITE
A THOUSAND ROADS LEAPED INTO ETERNITY
OR SINGING RAN TO MEET GOD'S VEILLESS FACE
THE KNOWN RELEASED HIM FROM ITS LIMITING CHAIN
HE KNOCKED AT THE DOORS OF THE UNKNOWABLE
THENCE GAZING WITH AN IMMEASURABLE OUTLOOK
ONE WITH SELF'S INLOOK INTO ITS OWN PURE VASTS
HE SAW THE SPLENDOUR OF THE SPIRIT'S REALMS
THE GREATNESS AND WONDER OF ITS BOUNDLESS WORKS
THE POWER AND PASSION LEAPING FROM ITS CALM
THE RAPTURE OF ITS MOVEMENT AND ITS REST
AND ITS FIRE-SWEET MIRACLE OF TRANSCENDENT LIFE
THE MILLION-POINTING UNDIVIDED GRASP
OF ITS VISION OF ONE SAME STUPENDOUS ALL
ITS INEXHAUSTIBLE ACTS IN A TIMELESS TIME
A SPACE THAT IS ITS OWN INFINITY
A GLORIOUS MULTIPLE OF ONE RADIANT SELF
ANSWERING TO JOY WITH JOY TO LOVE WITH LOVE
ALL THERE WERE MOVING MANSIONS OF GOD-BLISS
ETERNAL AND UNIQUE THEY LIVED THE ONE
THERE FORCES ARE GREAT OUTBURSTS OF GOD'S TRUTH
AND OBJECTS ARE ITS PURE SPIRITUAL SHAPES
SPIRIT NO MORE IS HID FROM ITS OWN VIEW
ALL SENTIENCE IS A SEA OF HAPPINESS
AND ALL CREATION IS AN ACT OF LIGHT
OUT OF THE NEUTRAL SILENCE OF HIS SOUL
HE PASSED TO ITS FIELDS OF PUISSANCE AND OF CALM
AND SAW THE POWERS THAT STAND ABOVE THE WORLD
TRAVERSED THE REALMS OF THE SUPREME IDEA
AND SOUGHT THE SUMMIT OF CREATED THINGS
AND THE ALMIGHTY SOURCE OF COSMIC CHANGE
299
THERE KNOWLEDGE CALLED HIM TO HER MYSTIC PEAKS
WHERE THOUGHT IS HELD IN A VAST INTERNAL SENSE
AND FEELING SWIMS ACROSS A SEA OF PEACE
AND VISION CLIMBS BEYOND THE REACH OF TIME
AN EQUAL OF THE FIRST CREATOR SEERS
ACCOMPANIED BY AN ALL-REVEALING LIGHT
HE MOVED THROUGH REGIONS OF TRANSCENDENT TRUTH
INWARD IMMENSE INNUMERABLY ONE
THERE DISTANCE WAS HIS OWN HUGE SPIRIT'S EXTENT
DELIVERED FROM THE FICTIONS OF THE MIND
TIME'S TRIPLE DIVIDING STEP BAFFLED NO MORE
ITS INEVITABLE AND CONTINUOUS STREAM
THE LONG FLOW OF ITS MANIFESTING COURSE
WAS HELD IN SPIRIT'S SINGLE WIDE REGARD
A UNIVERSAL BEAUTY SHOWED ITS FACE
THE INVISIBLE DEEP-FRAUGHT SIGNIFICANCES
HERE SHELTERED BEHIND FORM'S INSENSIBLE SCREEN
UNCOVERED TO HIM THEIR DEATHLESS HARMONY
AND THE KEY TO THE WONDER-BOOK OF COMMON THINGS
IN THEIR UNITING LAW STOOD UP REVEALED
THE MULTIPLE MEASURES OF THE UPBUILDING FORCE
THE LINES OF THE WORLD-GEOMETER'S TECHNIQUE
THE ENCHANTMENTS THAT UPHOLD THE COSMIC WEB
AND THE MAGIC UNDERLYING SIMPLE SHAPES
ON PEAKS WHERE SILENCE LISTENS WITH STILL HEART
TO THE RHYTHMIC METRES OF THE ROLLING WORLDS
HE SERVED THE SESSIONS OF THE TRIPLE FIRE
ON THE RIM OF TWO CONTINENTS OF SLUMBER AND TRANCE
HE HEARD THE EVER UNSPOKEN REALITY'S VOICE
AWAKEN REVELATION'S MYSTIC CRY
THE BIRTHPLACE FOUND OF THE SUDDEN INFALLIBLE WORD
AND LIVED IN THE RAYS OF AN INTUITIVE SUN
ABSOLVED FROM THE LIGAMENTS OF DEATH AND SLEEP
HE RODE THE LIGHTNING SEAS OF COSMIC MIND
AND CROSSED THE OCEAN OF ORIGINAL SOUND
ON THE LAST STEP TO THE SUPERNAL BIRTH
300
HE TROD ALONG EXTINCTION'S NARROW EDGE
NEAR THE HIGH VERGES OF ETERNITY
AND MOUNTED THE GOLD RIDGE OF THE WORLD-DREAM
BETWEEN THE SLAYER AND THE SAVIOUR FIRES
THE BELT HE REACHED OF THE UNCHANGING TRUTH
MET BORDERS OF THE INEXPRESSIBLE LIGHT
AND THRILLED WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE INEFFABLE
ABOVE HIM HE SAW THE FLAMING HIERARCHIES
THE WINGS THAT FOLD AROUND CREATED SPACE
THE SUN-EYED GUARDIANS AND THE GOLDEN SPHINX
AND THE TIERED PLANES AND THE IMMUTABLE LORDS
A WISDOM WAITING ON OMNISCIENCE
SAT VOICELESS IN A VAST PASSIVITY
IT JUDGED NOT MEASURED NOT NOR STROVE TO KNOW
BUT LISTENED FOR THE VEILED ALL-SEEING THOUGHT
AND THE BURDEN OF A CALM TRANSCENDENT VOICE
HE HAD REACHED THE TOP OF ALL THAT CAN BE KNOWN
HIS SIGHT SURPASSED CREATION'S HEAD AND BASE
ABLAZE THE TRIPLE HEAVENS REVEALED THEIR SUNS
THE OBSCURE ABYSS EXPOSED ITS MONSTROUS RULE
ALL BUT THE ULTIMATE MYSTERY WAS HIS FIELD
ALMOST THE UNKNOWABLE DISCLOSED ITS RIM
HIS SELF'S INFINITIES BEGAN TO EMERGE
THE HIDDEN UNIVERSES CRIED TO HIM
ETERNITIES CALLED TO ETERNITIES
SENDING THEIR SPEECHLESS MESSAGE STILL REMOTE
ARISEN FROM THE MARVEL OF THE DEPTHS
AND BURNING FROM THE SUPERCONSCIOUS HEIGHTS
AND SWEEPING IN GREAT HORIZONTAL GYRES
A MILLION ENERGIES JOINED AND WERE THE ONE
ALL FLOWED IMMEASURABLY TO ONE SEA
ALL LIVING FORMS BECAME ITS ATOM HOMES
A PANERGY THAT HARMONISED ALL LIFE
HELD NOW EXISTENCE IN ITS VAST CONTROL
A PORTION OF THAT MAJESTY HE WAS MADE
AT WILL HE LIVED IN THE UNOBLIVIOUS RAY
301
IN THAT HIGH REALM WHERE NO UNTRUTH CAN COME
WHERE ALL ARE DIFFERENT AND ALL IS ONE
IN THE IMPERSONAL'S OCEAN WITHOUT SHORE
THE PERSON IN THE WORLD-SPIRIT ANCHORED RODE
IT THRILLED WITH THE MIGHTY MARCHINGS OF WORLD-FORCE
ITS ACTS WERE THE COMRADES OF GOD'S INFINITE PEACE
AN ADJUNCT GLORY AND A SYMBOL SELF
THE BODY WAS DELIVERED TO THE SOUL
AN IMMORTAL POINT OF POWER A BLOCK OF POISE
IN A COSMICITY'S WIDE FORMLESS SURGE
A CONSCIOUS EDGE OF THE TRANSCENDENT'S MIGHT
CARVING PERFECTION FROM A BRIGHT WORLD-STUFF
IT FIGURED IN IT A UNIVERSE'S SENSE
THERE CONSCIOUSNESS WAS A CLOSE AND SINGLE WEFT
THE FAR AND NEAR WERE ONE IN SPIRIT-SPACE
THE MOMENTS THERE WERE PREGNANT WITH ALL TIME
THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S SCREEN WAS RIPPED BY THOUGHT
IDEA ROTATED SYMPHONIES OF SIGHT
SIGHT WAS A FLAME-THROW FROM IDENTITY
LIFE WAS A MARVELLOUS JOURNEY OF THE SPIRIT
FEELING A WAVE FROM THE UNIVERSAL BLISS
IN THE KINGDOM OF THE SPIRIT'S POWER AND LIGHT
AS IF ONE WHO ARRIVED OUT OF INFINITY'S WOMB
HE CAME NEW-BORN INFANT AND LIMITLESS
AND GREW IN THE WISDOM OF THE TIMELESS CHILD
HE WAS A VAST THAT SOON BECAME A SUN
A GREAT LUMINOUS SILENCE WHISPERED TO HIS HEART
HIS KNOWLEDGE AN INVIEW CAUGHT UNFATHOMABLE
AN OUTVIEW BY NO BRIEF HORIZONS CUT
HE THOUGHT AND FELT IN ALL HIS GAZE HAD POWER
HE COMMUNED WITH THE INCOMMUNICABLE
BEINGS OF A WIDER CONSCIOUSNESS WERE HIS FRIENDS
FORMS OF A LARGER SUBTLER MAKE DREW NEAR
THE GODS CONVERSED WITH HIM BEHIND LIFE'S VEIL
NEIGHBOUR HIS BEING GREW TO NATURE'S CRESTS
THE PRIMAL ENERGY TOOK HIM IN ITS ARMS
302
HIS BRAIN WAS WRAPPED IN OVERWHELMING LIGHT
AN ALL-EMBRACING KNOWLEDGE SEIZED HIS HEART
THOUGHTS ROSE IN HIM NO EARTHLY MIND CAN HOLD
MIGHTS PLAYED THAT NEVER COURSED THROUGH MORTAL NERVES
HE SCANNED THE SECRETS OF THE OVERMIND
HE BORE THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERSOUL
A BORDERER OF THE EMPIRE OF THE SUN
ATTUNED TO THE SUPERNAL HARMONIES
HE LINKED CREATION TO THE ETERNAL'S SPHERE
HIS FINITE PARTS APPROACHED THEIR ABSOLUTES
HIS ACTIONS FRAMED THE MOVEMENTS OF THE GODS
HIS WILL TOOK UP THE REINS OF COSMIC FORCE
305
ALL IS TOO LITTLE THAT THE WORLD CAN GIVE
ITS POWER AND KNOWLEDGE ARE THE GIFTS OF TIME
AND CANNOT FILL THE SPIRIT'S SACRED THIRST
ALTHOUGH OF ONE THESE FORMS OF GREATNESS ARE
AND BY ITS BREATH OF GRACE OUR LIVES ABIDE
ALTHOUGH MORE NEAR TO US THAN NEARNESS' SELF
IT IS SOME UTTER TRUTH OF WHAT WE ARE
HIDDEN BY ITS OWN WORKS IT SEEMED FAR-OFF
IMPENETRABLE OCCULT VOICELESS OBSCURE
THE PRESENCE WAS LOST BY WHICH ALL THINGS HAVE CHARM
THE GLORY LACKED OF WHICH THEY ARE DIM SIGNS
THE WORLD LIVED ON MADE EMPTY OF ITS CAUSE
LIKE LOVE WHEN THE BELOVED'S FACE IS GONE
THE LABOUR TO KNOW SEEMED A VAIN STRIFE OF MIND
ALL KNOWLEDGE ENDED IN THE UNKNOWABLE
THE EFFORT TO RULE SEEMED A VAIN PRIDE OF WILL
A TRIVIAL ACHIEVEMENT SCORNED BY TIME
ALL POWER RETIRED INTO THE OMNIPOTENT
A CAVE OF DARKNESS GUARDS THE ETERNAL LIGHT
A SILENCE SETTLED ON HIS STRIVING HEART
ABSOLVED FROM THE VOICES OF THE WORLD'S DESIRE
HE TURNED TO THE INEFFABLE'S TIMELESS CALL
A BEING INTIMATE AND UNNAMEABLE
A WIDE COMPELLING ECSTASY AND PEACE
FELT IN HIMSELF AND ALL AND YET UNGRASPED
APPROACHED AND FADED FROM HIS SOUL'S PURSUIT
AS IF FOR EVER LURING HIM BEYOND
NEAR IT RETREATED FAR IT CALLED HIM STILL
NOTHING COULD SATISFY BUT ITS DELIGHT
ITS ABSENCE LEFT THE GREATEST ACTIONS DULL
ITS PRESENCE MADE THE SMALLEST SEEM DIVINE
306
WHEN IT WAS THERE THE HEART'S ABYSS WAS FILLED
BUT WHEN THE UPLIFTING DEITY WITHDREW
EXISTENCE LOST ITS AIM IN THE INANE
THE ORDER OF THE IMMEMORIAL PLANES
THE GODLIKE FULLNESS OF THE INSTRUMENTS
WERE TURNED TO PROPS FOR AN IMPERMANENT SCENE
BUT WHO THAT MIGHTINESS WAS HE KNEW NOT YET
IMPALPABLE YET FILLING ALL THAT IS
IT MADE AND BLOTTED OUT A MILLION WORLDS
AND TOOK AND LOST A THOUSAND SHAPES AND NAMES
IT WORE THE GUISE OF AN INDISCERNIBLE VAST
OR WAS A SUBTLE KERNEL IN THE SOUL
A DISTANT GREATNESS LEFT IT HUGE AND DIM
A MYSTIC CLOSENESS SHUT IT SWEETLY IN
IT SEEMED SOMETIMES A FIGMENT OR A ROBE
AND SEEMED SOMETIMES HIS OWN COLOSSAL SHADE
A GIANT DOUBT OVERSHADOWED HIS ADVANCE
ACROSS A NEUTRAL ALL-SUPPORTING VOID
WHOSE BLANKNESS NURSED HIS LONE IMMORTAL SPIRIT
ALLURED TOWARDS SOME RECONDITE SUPREME
AIDED COERCED BY ENIGMATIC POWERS
ASPIRING AND HALF-SINKING AND UPBORNE
INVINCIBLY HE ASCENDED WITHOUT PAUSE
ALWAYS A SIGNLESS VAGUE IMMENSITY
BROODED WITHOUT APPROACH BEYOND RESPONSE
CONDEMNING FINITE THINGS TO NOTHINGNESS
FRONTING HIM WITH THE INCOMMENSURABLE
THEN TO THE ASCENT THERE CAME A MIGHTY TERM
A HEIGHT WAS REACHED WHERE NOTHING MADE COULD LIVE
A LINE WHERE EVERY HOPE AND SEARCH MUST CEASE
NEARED SOME INTOLERANT BARE REALITY
A ZERO FORMED PREGNANT WITH BOUNDLESS CHANGE
ON A DIZZY VERGE WHERE ALL DISGUISES FAIL
AND HUMAN MIND MUST ABDICATE IN LIGHT
OR DIE LIKE A MOTH IN THE NAKED BLAZE OF TRUTH
HE STOOD COMPELLED TO A TREMENDOUS CHOICE
307
ALL HE HAD BEEN AND ALL TOWARDS WHICH HE GREW
MUST NOW BE LEFT BEHIND OR ELSE TRANSFORM
INTO A SELF OF THAT WHICH HAS NO NAME
ALONE AND FRONTING AN INTANGIBLE FORCE
WHICH OFFERED NOTHING TO THE GRASP OF THOUGHT
HIS SPIRIT FACED THE ADVENTURE OF THE INANE
ABANDONED BY THE WORLDS OF FORM HE STROVE
A FRUITFUL WORLD-WIDE IGNORANCE FOUNDERED HERE
THOUGHT'S LONG FAR-CIRCLING JOURNEY TOUCHED ITS CLOSE
AND INEFFECTIVE PAUSED THE ACTOR WILL
THE SYMBOL MODES OF BEING HELPED NO MORE
THE STRUCTURES NESCIENCE BUILDS COLLAPSING FAILED
AND EVEN THE SPIRIT THAT HOLDS THE UNIVERSE
FAINTED IN LUMINOUS INSUFFICIENCY
IN AN ABYSMAL LAPSE OF ALL THINGS BUILT
TRANSCENDING EVERY PERISHABLE SUPPORT
AND JOINING AT LAST ITS MIGHTY ORIGIN
THE SEPARATE SELF MUST MELT OR BE REBORN
INTO A TRUTH BEYOND THE MIND'S APPEAL
ALL GLORY OF OUTLINE SWEETNESS OF HARMONY
REJECTED LIKE A GRACE OF TRIVIAL NOTES
EXPUNGED FROM BEING'S SILENCE NUDE AUSTERE
DIED INTO A FINE AND BLISSFUL NOTHINGNESS
THE DEMIURGES LOST THEIR NAMES AND FORMS
THE GREAT SCHEMED WORLDS THAT THEY HAD PLANNED AND WROUGHT
PASSED TAKEN AND ABOLISHED ONE BY ONE
THE UNIVERSE REMOVED ITS COLOURED VEIL
AND AT THE UNIMAGINABLE END
OF THE HUGE RIDDLE OF CREATED THINGS
APPEARED THE FAR-SEEN GODHEAD OF THE WHOLE
HIS FEET FIRM-BASED ON LIFE'S STUPENDOUS WINGS
OMNIPOTENT A LONELY SEER OF TIME
INWARD INSCRUTABLE WITH DIAMOND GAZE
ATTRACTED BY THE UNFATHOMABLE REGARD
THE UNSOLVED SLOW CYCLES TO THEIR FOUNT RETURNED
TO RISE AGAIN FROM THAT INVISIBLE SEA
308
ALL FROM HIS PUISSANCE BORN WAS NOW UNDONE
NOTHING REMAINED THE COSMIC MIND CONCEIVES
ETERNITY PREPARED TO FADE AND SEEMED
A HUE AND IMPOSITION ON THE VOID
SPACE WAS THE FLUTTERING OF A DREAM THAT SANK
BEFORE ITS ENDING INTO NOTHING'S DEEPS
THE SPIRIT THAT DIES NOT AND THE GODHEAD'S SELF
SEEMED MYTHS PROJECTED FROM THE UNKNOWABLE
FROM IT ALL SPRANG IN IT IS CALLED TO CEASE
BUT WHAT THAT WAS NO THOUGHT NOR SIGHT COULD TELL
ONLY A FORMLESS FORM OF SELF WAS LEFT
A TENUOUS GHOST OF SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN
THE LAST EXPERIENCE OF A LAPSING WAVE
BEFORE IT SINKS INTO A BOURNELESS SEA
AS IF IT KEPT EVEN ON THE BRINK OF NOUGHT
ITS BARE FEELING OF THE OCEAN WHENCE IT CAME
A VASTNESS BROODED FREE FROM SENSE OF SPACE
AN EVERLASTINGNESS CUT OFF FROM TIME
A STRANGE SUBLIME INALTERABLE PEACE
SILENT REJECTED FROM IT WORLD AND SOUL
A STARK COMPANIONLESS REALITY
ANSWERED AT LAST TO HIS SOUL'S PASSIONATE SEARCH
PASSIONLESS WORDLESS ABSORBED IN ITS FATHOMLESS HUSH
KEEPING THE MYSTERY NONE WOULD EVER PIERCE
IT BROODED INSCRUTABLE AND INTANGIBLE
FACING HIM WITH ITS DUMB TREMENDOUS CALM
IT HAD NO KINSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSE
THERE WAS NO ACT NO MOVEMENT IN ITS VAST
LIFE'S QUESTION MET BY ITS SILENCE DIED ON HER LIPS
THE WORLD'S EFFORT CEASED CONVICTED OF IGNORANCE
FINDING NO SANCTION OF SUPERNAL LIGHT
THERE WAS NO MIND THERE WITH ITS NEED TO KNOW
THERE WAS NO HEART THERE WITH ITS NEED TO LOVE
ALL PERSON PERISHED IN ITS NAMELESSNESS
THERE WAS NO SECOND IT HAD NO PARTNER OR PEER
ONLY ITSELF WAS REAL TO ITSELF
309
A PURE EXISTENCE SAFE FROM THOUGHT AND MOOD
A CONSCIOUSNESS OF UNSHARED IMMORTAL BLISS
IT DWELT ALOOF IN ITS BARE INFINITE
ONE AND UNIQUE UNUTTERABLY SOLE
A BEING FORMLESS FEATURELESS AND MUTE
THAT KNEW ITSELF BY ITS OWN TIMELESS SELF
AWARE FOR EVER IN ITS MOTIONLESS DEPTHS
UNCREATING UNCREATED AND UNBORN
THE ONE BY WHOM ALL LIVE WHO LIVES BY NONE
AN IMMEASURABLE LUMINOUS SECRECY
GUARDED BY THE VEILS OF THE UNMANIFEST
ABOVE THE CHANGING COSMIC INTERLUDE
ABODE SUPREME IMMUTABLY THE SAME
A SILENT CAUSE OCCULT IMPENETRABLE
INFINITE ETERNAL UNTHINKABLE ALONE
310
A STILLNESS ABSOLUTE INCOMMUNICABLE
MEETS THE SHEER SELF-DISCOVERY OF THE SOUL
A WALL OF STILLNESS SHUTS IT FROM THE WORLD
A GULF OF STILLNESS SWALLOWS UP THE SENSE
AND MAKES UNREAL ALL THAT MIND HAS KNOWN
ALL THAT THE LABOURING SENSES STILL WOULD WEAVE
PROLONGING AN IMAGED UNREALITY
SELF'S VAST SPIRITUAL SILENCE OCCUPIES SPACE
ONLY THE INCONCEIVABLE IS LEFT
ONLY THE NAMELESS WITHOUT SPACE AND TIME
ABOLISHED IS THE BURDENING NEED OF LIFE
THOUGHT FALLS FROM US WE CEASE FROM JOY AND GRIEF
THE EGO IS DEAD WE ARE FREED FROM BEING AND CARE
WE HAVE DONE WITH BIRTH AND DEATH AND WORK AND FATE
O SOUL IT IS TOO EARLY TO REJOICE
THOU HAST REACHED THE BOUNDLESS SILENCE OF THE SELF
THOU HAST LEAPED INTO A GLAD DIVINE ABYSS
BUT WHERE HAST THOU THROWN SELF'S MISSION AND SELF'S POWER
ON WHAT DEAD BANK ON THE ETERNAL'S ROAD
ONE WAS WITHIN THEE WHO WAS SELF AND WORLD
WHAT HAST THOU DONE FOR HIS PURPOSE IN THE STARS
ESCAPE BRINGS NOT THE VICTORY AND THE CROWN
SOMETHING THOU CAM'ST TO DO FROM THE UNKNOWN
BUT NOTHING IS FINISHED AND THE WORLD GOES ON
BECAUSE ONLY HALF GOD'S COSMIC WORK IS DONE
ONLY THE EVERLASTING NO HAS NEARED
AND STARED INTO THY EYES AND KILLED THY HEART
BUT WHERE IS THE LOVER'S EVERLASTING YES
AND IMMORTALITY IN THE SECRET HEART
THE VOICE THAT CHANTS TO THE CREATOR FIRE
THE SYMBOLLED OM THE GREAT ASSENTING WORD
311
THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE RAPTURE AND THE CALM
THE PASSION AND THE BEAUTY OF THE BRIDE
THE CHAMBER WHERE THE GLORIOUS ENEMIES KISS
THE SMILE THAT SAVES THE GOLDEN PEAK OF THINGS
THIS TOO IS TRUTH AT THE MYSTIC FOUNT OF LIFE
A BLACK VEIL HAS BEEN LIFTED WE HAVE SEEN
THE MIGHTY SHADOW OF THE OMNISCIENT LORD
BUT WHO HAS LIFTED UP THE VEIL OF LIGHT
AND WHO HAS SEEN THE BODY OF THE KING
THE MYSTERY OF GOD'S BIRTH AND ACTS REMAINS
LEAVING UNBROKEN THE LAST CHAPTER'S SEAL
UNSOLVED THE RIDDLE OF THE UNFINISHED PLAY
THE COSMIC PLAYER LAUGHS WITHIN HIS MASK
AND STILL THE LAST INVIOLATE SECRET HIDES
BEHIND THE HUMAN GLORY OF A FORM
BEHIND THE GOLD EIDOLON OF A NAME
A LARGE WHITE LINE HAS FIGURED AS A GOAL
BUT FAR BEYOND THE INEFFABLE SUNTRACKS BLAZE
WHAT SEEMED THE SOURCE AND END WAS A WIDE GATE
A LAST BARE STEP INTO ETERNITY
AN EYE HAS OPENED UPON TIMELESSNESS
INFINITY TAKES BACK THE FORMS IT GAVE
AND THROUGH GOD'S DARKNESS OR HIS NAKED LIGHT
HIS MILLION RAYS RETURN INTO THE SUN
THERE IS A ZERO SIGN OF THE SUPREME
NATURE LEFT NUDE AND STILL UNCOVERS GOD
BUT IN HER GRANDIOSE NOTHINGNESS ALL IS THERE
WHEN HER STRONG GARBS ARE TORN AWAY FROM US
THE SOUL'S IGNORANCE IS SLAIN BUT NOT THE SOUL
THE ZERO COVERS AN IMMORTAL FACE
A HIGH AND BLANK NEGATION IS NOT ALL
A HUGE EXTINCTION IS NOT GOD'S LAST WORD
LIFE'S ULTIMATE SENSE THE CLOSE OF BEING'S COURSE
THE MEANING OF THIS GREAT MYSTERIOUS WORLD
IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE SLEEPS AN ABSOLUTE POWER
AWAKING IT CAN WAKE THE TRANCE-BOUND SOUL
312
AND IN THE RAY REVEAL THE PARENT SUN
IT CAN MAKE THE WORLD A VESSEL OF SPIRIT'S FORCE
IT CAN FASHION IN THE CLAY GOD'S PERFECT SHAPE
TO FREE THE SELF IS BUT ONE RADIANT PACE
HERE TO FULFIL HIMSELF WAS GOD'S DESIRE
EVEN WHILE HE STOOD ON BEING'S NAKED EDGE
AND ALL THE PASSION AND SEEKING OF HIS SOUL
FACED THEIR EXTINCTION IN SOME FEATURELESS VAST
THE PRESENCE HE YEARNED FOR SUDDENLY DREW CLOSE
ACROSS THE SILENCE OF THE ULTIMATE CALM
OUT OF A MARVELLOUS TRANSCENDENCE' CORE
A BODY OF WONDER AND TRANSLUCENCY
AS IF A SWEET MYSTIC SUMMARY OF HER SELF
ESCAPING INTO THE ORIGINAL BLISS
HAD COME ENLARGED OUT OF ETERNITY
SOMEONE CAME INFINITE AND ABSOLUTE
A BEING OF WISDOM POWER AND DELIGHT
EVEN AS A MOTHER DRAWS HER CHILD TO HER ARMS
TOOK TO HER BREAST NATURE AND WORLD AND SOUL
ABOLISHING THE SIGNLESS EMPTINESS
BREAKING THE VACANCY AND VOICELESS HUSH
PIERCING THE LIMITLESS UNKNOWABLE
INTO THE LIBERTY OF THE MOTIONLESS DEPTHS
A BEAUTIFUL AND FELICITOUS LUSTRE STOLE
THE POWER THE LIGHT THE BLISS NO WORD CAN SPEAK
IMAGED ITSELF IN A SURPRISING BEAM
AND BUILT A GOLDEN PASSAGE TO HIS HEART
TOUCHING THROUGH HIM ALL LONGING SENTIENT THINGS
A MOMENT'S SWEETNESS OF THE ALL-BEAUTIFUL
CANCELLED THE VANITY OF THE COSMIC WHIRL
A NATURE THROBBING WITH A HEART DIVINE
WAS FELT IN THE UNCONSCIOUS UNIVERSE
IT MADE THE BREATH A HAPPY MYSTERY
A LOVE THAT BORE THE CROSS OF PAIN WITH JOY
EUDAEMONISED THE SORROW OF THE WORLD
313
MADE HAPPY THE WEIGHT OF LONG UNENDING TIME
THE SECRET CAUGHT OF GOD'S FELICITY
AFFIRMING IN LIFE A HIDDEN ECSTASY
IT HELD THE SPIRIT TO ITS MIRACULOUS COURSE
CARRYING IMMORTAL VALUES TO THE HOURS
IT JUSTIFIED THE LABOUR OF THE SUNS
FOR ONE WAS THERE SUPREME BEHIND THE GOD
A MOTHER MIGHT BROODED UPON THE WORLD
A CONSCIOUSNESS REVEALED ITS MARVELLOUS FRONT
TRANSCENDING ALL THAT IS DENYING NONE
IMPERISHABLE ABOVE OUR FALLEN HEADS
HE FELT A RAPTUROUS AND UNSTUMBLING FORCE
THE UNDYING TRUTH APPEARED THE ENDURING POWER
OF ALL THAT HERE IS MADE AND THEN DESTROYED
THE MOTHER OF ALL GODHEADS AND ALL STRENGTHS
WHO MEDIATRIX BINDS EARTH TO THE SUPREME
THE ENIGMA CEASED THAT RULES OUR NATURE'S NIGHT
THE COVERING NESCIENCE WAS UNMASKED AND SLAIN
ITS MIND OF ERROR WAS STRIPPED OFF FROM THINGS
AND THE DULL MOODS OF ITS PERVERTING WILL
ILLUMINED BY HER ALL-SEEING IDENTITY
KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE COULD STRIVE NO MORE
NO LONGER COULD THE TITAN OPPOSITES
ANTAGONIST POLES OF THE WORLD'S ARTIFICE
IMPOSE THE ILLUSION OF THEIR TWOFOLD SCREEN
THROWING THEIR FIGURES BETWEEN US AND HER
THE WISDOM WAS NEAR DISGUISED BY ITS OWN WORKS
OF WHICH THE DARKENED UNIVERSE IS THE ROBE
NO MORE EXISTENCE SEEMED AN AIMLESS FALL
EXTINCTION WAS NO MORE THE SOLE RELEASE
THE HIDDEN WORD WAS FOUND THE LONG-SOUGHT CLUE
REVEALED WAS THE MEANING OF OUR SPIRIT'S BIRTH
CONDEMNED TO AN IMPERFECT BODY AND MIND
IN THE INCONSCIENCE OF MATERIAL THINGS
AND THE INDIGNITY OF MORTAL LIFE
A HEART WAS FELT IN THE SPACES WIDE AND BARE
314
A BURNING LOVE FROM WHITE SPIRITUAL FOUNTS
ANNULLED THE SORROW OF THE IGNORANT DEPTHS
SUFFERING WAS LOST IN HER IMMORTAL SMILE
A LIFE FROM BEYOND GREW CONQUEROR HERE OF DEATH
TO ERR NO MORE WAS NATURAL TO MIND
WRONG COULD NOT COME WHERE ALL WAS LIGHT AND LOVE
THE FORMLESS AND THE FORMED WERE JOINED IN HER
IMMENSITY WAS EXCEEDED BY A LOOK
A FACE REVEALED THE CROWDED INFINITE
INCARNATING INEXPRESSIBLY IN HER LIMBS
THE BOUNDLESS JOY THE BLIND WORLD-FORCES SEEK
HER BODY OF BEAUTY MOONED THE SEAS OF BLISS
AT THE HEAD SHE STANDS OF BIRTH AND TOIL AND FATE
IN THEIR SLOW ROUND THE CYCLES TURN TO HER CALL
ALONE HER HANDS CAN CHANGE TIME'S DRAGON BASE
HERS IS THE MYSTERY THE NIGHT CONCEALS
THE SPIRIT'S ALCHEMIST ENERGY IS HERS
SHE IS THE GOLDEN BRIDGE THE WONDERFUL FIRE
THE LUMINOUS HEART OF THE UNKNOWN IS SHE
A POWER OF SILENCE IN THE DEPTHS OF GOD
SHE IS THE FORCE THE INEVITABLE WORD
THE MAGNET OF OUR DIFFICULT ASCENT
THE SUN FROM WHICH WE KINDLE ALL OUR SUNS
THE LIGHT THAT LEANS FROM THE UNREALISED VASTS
THE JOY THAT BECKONS FROM THE IMPOSSIBLE
THE MIGHT OF ALL THAT NEVER YET CAME DOWN
ALL NATURE DUMBLY CALLS TO HER ALONE
TO HEAL WITH HER FEET THE ACHING THROB OF LIFE
AND BREAK THE SEALS ON THE DIM SOUL OF MAN
AND KINDLE HER FIRE IN THE CLOSED HEART OF THINGS
ALL HERE SHALL BE ONE DAY HER SWEETNESS' HOME
ALL CONTRARIES PREPARE HER HARMONY
TOWARDS HER OUR KNOWLEDGE CLIMBS OUR PASSION GROPES
IN HER MIRACULOUS RAPTURE WE SHALL DWELL
HER CLASP SHALL TURN TO ECSTASY OUR PAIN
OUR SELF SHALL BE ONE SELF WITH ALL THROUGH HER
315
IN HER CONFIRMED BECAUSE TRANSFORMED IN HER
OUR LIFE SHALL FIND IN ITS FULFILLED RESPONSE
ABOVE THE BOUNDLESS HUSHED BEATITUDES
BELOW THE WONDER OF THE EMBRACE DIVINE
THIS KNOWN AS IN A THUNDER-FLASH OF GOD
THE RAPTURE OF THINGS ETERNAL FILLED HIS LIMBS
AMAZEMENT FELL UPON HIS RAVISHED SENSE
HIS SPIRIT WAS CAUGHT IN HER INTOLERANT FLAME
ONCE SEEN HIS HEART ACKNOWLEDGED ONLY HER
ONLY A HUNGER OF INFINITE BLISS WAS LEFT
ALL AIMS IN HER WERE LOST THEN FOUND IN HER
HIS BASE WAS GATHERED TO ONE POINTING SPIRE
THIS WAS A SEED CAST INTO ENDLESS TIME
A WORD IS SPOKEN OR A LIGHT IS SHOWN
A MOMENT SEES THE AGES TOIL TO EXPRESS
SO FLASHING OUT OF THE TIMELESS LEAPED THE WORLDS
AN ETERNAL INSTANT IS THE CAUSE OF THE YEARS
ALL HE HAD DONE WAS TO PREPARE A FIELD
HIS SMALL BEGINNINGS ASKED FOR A MIGHTY END
FOR ALL THAT HE HAD BEEN MUST NOW NEW-SHAPE
IN HIM HER JOY TO EMBODY TO ENSHRINE
HER BEAUTY AND GREATNESS IN HIS HOUSE OF LIFE
BUT NOW HIS BEING WAS TOO WIDE FOR SELF
HIS HEART'S DEMAND HAD GROWN IMMEASURABLE
HIS SINGLE FREEDOM COULD NOT SATISFY
HER LIGHT HER BLISS HE ASKED FOR EARTH AND MEN
BUT VAIN ARE HUMAN POWER AND HUMAN LOVE
TO BREAK EARTH'S SEAL OF IGNORANCE AND DEATH
HIS NATURE'S MIGHT SEEMED NOW AN INFANT'S GRASP
HEAVEN IS TOO HIGH FOR OUTSTRETCHED HANDS TO SEIZE
THIS LIGHT COMES NOT BY STRUGGLE OR BY THOUGHT
IN THE MIND'S SILENCE THE TRANSCENDENT ACTS
AND THE HUSHED HEART HEARS THE UNUTTERED WORD
A VAST SURRENDER WAS HIS ONLY STRENGTH
A POWER THAT LIVES UPON THE HEIGHTS MUST ACT
316
BRING INTO LIFE'S CLOSED ROOM THE IMMORTAL'S AIR
AND FILL THE FINITE WITH THE INFINITE
ALL THAT DENIES MUST BE TORN OUT AND SLAIN
AND CRUSHED THE MANY LONGINGS FOR WHOSE SAKE
WE LOSE THE ONE FOR WHOM OUR LIVES WERE MADE
NOW OTHER CLAIMS HAD HUSHED IN HIM THEIR CRY
ONLY HE LONGED TO DRAW HER PRESENCE AND POWER
INTO HIS HEART AND MIND AND BREATHING FRAME
ONLY HE YEARNED TO CALL FOR EVER DOWN
HER HEALING TOUCH OF LOVE AND TRUTH AND JOY
INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE SUFFERING WORLD
HIS SOUL WAS FREED AND GIVEN TO HER ALONE
317
A MIGHTIER TASK REMAINED THAN ALL HE HAD DONE
TO THAT HE TURNED FROM WHICH ALL BEING COMES
A SIGN ATTENDING FROM THE SECRECY
WHICH KNOWS THE TRUTH UNGRASPED BEHIND OUR THOUGHTS
AND GUARDS THE WORLD WITH ITS ALL-SEEING GAZE
IN THE UNAPPROACHABLE STILLNESS OF HIS SOUL
INTENSE ONE-POINTED MONUMENTAL LONE
PATIENT HE SAT LIKE AN INCARNATE HOPE
MOTIONLESS ON A PEDESTAL OF PRAYER
A STRENGTH HE SOUGHT THAT WAS NOT YET ON EARTH
HELP FROM A POWER TOO GREAT FOR MORTAL WILL
THE LIGHT OF A TRUTH NOW ONLY SEEN AFAR
A SANCTION FROM HIS HIGH OMNIPOTENT SOURCE
BUT FROM THE APPALLING HEIGHTS THERE STOOPED NO VOICE
THE TIMELESS LIDS WERE CLOSED NO OPENING CAME
A NEUTRAL HELPLESS VOID OPPRESSED THE YEARS
IN THE TEXTURE OF OUR BOUND HUMANITY
HE FELT THE STARK RESISTANCE HUGE AND DUMB
OF OUR INCONSCIENT AND UNSEEING BASE
THE STUBBORN MUTE REJECTION IN LIFE'S DEPTHS
THE IGNORANT NO IN THE ORIGIN OF THINGS
A VEILED COLLABORATION WITH THE NIGHT
EVEN IN HIMSELF SURVIVED AND HID FROM HIS VIEW
STILL SOMETHING IN HIS EARTHLY BEING KEPT
ITS KINSHIP WITH THE INCONSCIENT WHENCE IT CAME
A SHADOWY UNITY WITH A VANISHED PAST
TREASURED IN AN OLD-WORLD FRAME WAS LURKING THERE
SECRET UNNOTED BY THE ILLUMINED MIND
AND IN SUBCONSCIOUS WHISPERS AND IN DREAM
STILL MURMURED AT THE MIND'S AND SPIRIT'S CHOICE
ITS TREACHEROUS ELEMENTS SPREAD LIKE SLIPPERY GRAINS
318
HOPING THE INCOMING TRUTH MIGHT STUMBLE AND FALL
AND OLD IDEAL VOICES WANDERING MOANED
AND PLEADED FOR A HEAVENLY LENIENCY
TO THE GRACIOUS IMPERFECTIONS OF OUR EARTH
AND THE SWEET WEAKNESSES OF OUR MORTAL STATE
THIS NOW HE WILLED TO DISCOVER AND EXILE
THE ELEMENT IN HIM BETRAYING GOD
ALL NATURE'S RECONDITE SPACES WERE STRIPPED BARE
ALL HER DIM CRYPTS AND CORNERS SEARCHED WITH FIRE
WHERE REFUGEE INSTINCTS AND UNSHAPED REVOLTS
COULD SHELTER FIND IN DARKNESS' SANCTUARY
AGAINST THE WHITE PURITY OF HEAVEN'S CLEANSING FLAME
ALL SEEMED TO HAVE PERISHED THAT WAS UNDIVINE
YET SOME MINUTEST DISSIDENT MIGHT ESCAPE
AND STILL A CENTRE LURK OF THE BLIND FORCE
FOR THE INCONSCIENT TOO IS INFINITE
THE MORE ITS ABYSSES WE INSIST TO SOUND
THE MORE IT STRETCHES STRETCHES ENDLESSLY
THEN LEST A HUMAN CRY SHOULD SPOIL THE TRUTH
HE TORE DESIRE UP FROM ITS BLEEDING ROOTS
AND OFFERED TO THE GODS THE VACANT PLACE
THUS COULD HE BEAR THE TOUCH IMMACULATE
A LAST AND MIGHTIEST TRANSFORMATION CAME
HIS SOUL WAS ALL IN FRONT LIKE A GREAT SEA
FLOODING THE MIND AND BODY WITH ITS WAVES
HIS BEING SPREAD TO EMBRACE THE UNIVERSE
UNITED THE WITHIN AND THE WITHOUT
TO MAKE OF LIFE A COSMIC HARMONY
AN EMPIRE OF THE IMMANENT DIVINE
IN THIS TREMENDOUS UNIVERSALITY
NOT ONLY HIS SOUL-NATURE AND MIND-SENSE
INCLUDED EVERY SOUL AND MIND IN HIS
BUT EVEN THE LIFE OF FLESH AND NERVE WAS CHANGED
AND GREW ONE FLESH AND NERVE WITH ALL THAT LIVES
HE FELT THE JOY OF OTHERS AS HIS JOY
HE BORE THE GRIEF OF OTHERS AS HIS GRIEF
319
HIS UNIVERSAL SYMPATHY UPBORE
IMMENSE LIKE OCEAN THE CREATION'S LOAD
AS EARTH UPBEARS ALL BEINGS' SACRIFICE
THRILLED WITH THE HIDDEN TRANSCENDENT'S JOY AND PEACE
THERE WAS NO MORE DIVISION'S ENDLESS SCROLL
ONE GREW THE SPIRIT'S SECRET UNITY
ALL NATURE FELT AGAIN THE SINGLE BLISS
THERE WAS NO CLEAVAGE BETWEEN SOUL AND SOUL
THERE WAS NO BARRIER BETWEEN WORLD AND GOD
OVERPOWERED WERE FORM AND MEMORY'S LIMITING LINE
THE COVERING MIND WAS SEIZED AND TORN APART
IT WAS DISSOLVED AND NOW NO MORE COULD BE
THE ONE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MADE THE WORLD WAS SEEN
ALL NOW WAS LUMINOSITY AND FORCE
ABOLISHED IN ITS LAST THIN FAINTING TRACE
THE CIRCLE OF THE LITTLE SELF WAS GONE
THE SEPARATE BEING COULD NO MORE BE FELT
IT DISAPPEARED AND KNEW ITSELF NO MORE
LOST IN THE SPIRIT'S WIDE IDENTITY
HIS NATURE GREW A MOVEMENT OF THE ALL
EXPLORING ITSELF TO FIND THAT ALL WAS HE
HIS SOUL WAS A DELEGATION OF THE ALL
THAT TURNED FROM ITSELF TO JOIN THE ONE SUPREME
TRANSCENDED WAS THE HUMAN FORMULA
MAN'S HEART THAT HAD OBSCURED THE INVIOLABLE
ASSUMED THE MIGHTY BEATING OF A GOD'S
HIS SEEKING MIND CEASED IN THE TRUTH THAT KNOWS
HIS LIFE WAS A FLOW OF THE UNIVERSAL LIFE
HE STOOD FULFILLED ON THE WORLD'S HIGHEST LINE
AWAITING THE ASCENT BEYOND THE WORLD
AWAITING THE DESCENT THE WORLD TO SAVE
A SPLENDOUR AND A SYMBOL WRAPPED THE EARTH
SERENE EPIPHANIES LOOKED AND HALLOWED VASTS
SURROUNDED WISE INFINITUDES WERE CLOSE
AND BRIGHT REMOTENESSES LEANED NEAR AND KIN
SENSE FAILED IN THAT TREMENDOUS LUCENCY
320
EPHEMERAL VOICES FROM HIS HEARING FELL
AND THOUGHT POTENT NO MORE SANK LARGE AND PALE
LIKE A TIRED GOD INTO MYSTERIOUS SEAS
THE ROBES OF MORTAL THINKING WERE CAST DOWN
LEAVING HIS KNOWLEDGE BARE TO ABSOLUTE SIGHT
FATE'S DRIVING CEASED AND NATURE'S SLEEPLESS SPUR
THE ATHLETE HEAVINGS OF THE WILL WERE STILLED
IN THE OMNIPOTENT'S UNMOVING PEACE
LIFE IN HIS MEMBERS LAY DOWN VAST AND MUTE
NAKED UNWALLED UNTERRIFIED IT BORE
THE IMMENSE REGARD OF IMMORTALITY
THE LAST MOVEMENT DIED AND ALL AT ONCE GREW STILL
A WEIGHT THAT WAS THE UNSEEN TRANSCENDENT'S HAND
LAID ON HIS LIMBS THE SPIRIT'S MEASURELESS SEAL
INFINITY SWALLOWED HIM INTO SHORELESS TRANCE
AS ONE WHO SETS HIS SAIL TOWARDS MYSTERIED SHORES
DRIVEN THROUGH HUGE OCEANS BY THE BREATH OF GOD
THE FATHOMLESS BELOW THE UNKNOWN AROUND
HIS SOUL ABANDONED THE BLIND STAR-FIELD SPACE
AFAR FROM ALL THAT MAKES THE MEASURED WORLD
PLUNGING TO HIDDEN ETERNITIES IT WITHDREW
BACK FROM MIND'S FOAMING SURFACE TO THE VASTS
VOICELESS WITHIN US IN OMNISCIENT SLEEP
ABOVE THE IMPERFECT REACH OF WORD AND THOUGHT
BEYOND THE SIGHT THAT SEEKS SUPPORT OF FORM
LOST IN DEEP TRACTS OF SUPERCONSCIENT LIGHT
OR VOYAGING IN BLANK FEATURELESS NOTHINGNESS
SOLE IN THE TRACKLESS INCOMMENSURABLE
OR PAST NOT-SELF AND SELF AND SELFLESSNESS
TRANSGRESSING THE DREAM-SHORES OF CONSCIOUS MIND
HE REACHED AT LAST HIS SEMPITERNAL BASE
ON SORROWLESS HEIGHTS NO WINGING CRY DISTURBS
PURE AND UNTOUCHED ABOVE THIS MORTAL PLAY
IS SPREAD THE SPIRIT'S HUSHED IMMOBILE AIR
THERE NO BEGINNING IS AND THERE NO END
321
THERE IS THE STABLE FORCE OF ALL THAT MOVES
THERE THE AEONIC LABOURER IS AT REST
THERE TURNS NO KEYED CREATION IN THE VOID
NO GIANT MECHANISM WATCHED BY A SOUL
THERE CREAKS NO FATE-TURNED HUGE MACHINERY
THE MARRIAGE OF EVIL WITH GOOD WITHIN ONE BREAST
THE CLASH OF STRIFE IN THE VERY CLASP OF LOVE
THE DANGEROUS PAIN OF LIFE'S EXPERIMENT
IN THE VALUES OF INCONSEQUENCE AND CHANCE
THE PERIL OF MIND'S GAMBLE THROWING OUR LIVES
AS STAKE IN A WAGER OF INDIFFERENT GODS
AND THE SHIFTING LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF THE IDEA
FALLING UPON THE SURFACE CONSCIOUSNESS
AND IN THE DREAM OF A MUTE WITNESS SOUL
CREATING THE ERROR OF A HALF-SEEN WORLD
WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS A SEEKING IGNORANCE
LIFE'S STEPS A STUMBLING SERIES WITHOUT SUIT
ITS ASPECT OF FORTUITOUS DESIGN
ITS EQUAL MEASURE OF THE TRUE AND FALSE
IN THAT IMMOBILE AND IMMUTABLE REALM
FIND NO ACCESS NO CAUSE NO RIGHT TO LIVE
THERE ONLY REIGNS THE SPIRIT'S MOTIONLESS POWER
POISED IN ITSELF THROUGH STILL ETERNITY
AND ITS OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT PEACE
THOUGHT CLASHES NOT WITH THOUGHT AND TRUTH WITH TRUTH
THERE IS NO WAR OF RIGHT WITH RIVAL RIGHT
THERE ARE NO STUMBLING AND HALF-SEEING LIVES
PASSING FROM CHANCE TO UNEXPECTED CHANCE
NO SUFFERING OF HEARTS COMPELLED TO BEAT
IN BODIES OF THE INERT INCONSCIENT'S MAKE
ARMED WITH THE IMMUNE OCCULT UNSINKING FIRE
THE GUARDIANS OF ETERNITY KEEP ITS LAW
FOR EVER FIXED UPON TRUTH'S GIANT BASE
IN HER MAGNIFICENT AND TERMLESS HOME
THERE NATURE ON HER DUMB SPIRITUAL COUCH
IMMUTABLY TRANSCENDENT KNOWS HER SOURCE
322
AND TO THE STIR OF MULTITUDINOUS WORLDS
ASSENTS UNMOVED IN A PERPETUAL CALM
ALL-CAUSING ALL-SUSTAINING AND ALOOF
THE WITNESS LOOKS FROM HIS UNSHAKEN POISE
AN EYE IMMENSE REGARDING ALL THINGS DONE
APART AT PEACE ABOVE CREATION'S STIR
IMMERSED IN THE ETERNAL ALTITUDES
HE ABODE DEFENDED IN HIS SHORELESS SELF
COMPANIONED ONLY BY THE ALL-SEEING ONE
A MIND TOO MIGHTY TO BE BOUND BY THOUGHT
A LIFE TOO BOUNDLESS FOR THE PLAY IN SPACE
A SOUL WITHOUT BORDERS UNCONVINCED OF TIME
HE FELT THE EXTINCTION OF THE WORLD'S LONG PAIN
HE BECAME THE UNBORN SELF THAT NEVER DIES
HE JOINED THE SESSIONS OF INFINITY
ON THE COSMIC MURMUR PRIMAL LONELINESS FELL
ANNULLED WAS THE CONTACT FORMED WITH TIME-BORN THINGS
EMPTY GREW NATURE'S WIDE COMMUNITY
ALL THINGS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO THEIR FORMLESS SEED
THE WORLD WAS SILENT FOR A CYCLIC HOUR
ALTHOUGH THE AFFLICTED NATURE HE HAD LEFT
MAINTAINED BENEATH HIM HER BROAD NUMBERLESS FIELDS
HER ENORMOUS ACT RECEDING FAILED REMOTE
AS IF A SOULLESS DREAM AT LAST HAD CEASED
NO VOICE CAME DOWN FROM THE HIGH SILENCES
NONE ANSWERED FROM HER DESOLATE SOLITUDES
A STILLNESS OF CESSATION REIGNED THE WIDE
IMMORTAL HUSH BEFORE THE GODS ARE BORN
A UNIVERSAL FORCE AWAITED MUTE
THE VEILED TRANSCENDENT'S ULTIMATE DECREE
THEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME A DOWNWARD LOOK
AS IF A SEA EXPLORING ITS OWN DEPTHS
A LIVING ONENESS WIDENED AT ITS CORE
AND JOINED HIM TO UNNUMBERED MULTITUDES
A BLISS A LIGHT A POWER A FLAME-WHITE LOVE
323
CAUGHT ALL INTO A SOLE IMMENSE EMBRACE
EXISTENCE FOUND ITS TRUTH ON ONENESS' BREAST
AND EACH BECAME THE SELF AND SPACE OF ALL
THE GREAT WORLD-RHYTHMS WERE HEART-BEATS OF ONE SOUL
TO FEEL WAS A FLAME-DISCOVERY OF GOD
ALL MIND WAS A SINGLE HARP OF MANY STRINGS
ALL LIFE A SONG OF MANY MEETING LIVES
FOR WORLDS WERE MANY BUT THE SELF WAS ONE
THIS KNOWLEDGE NOW WAS MADE A COSMOS' SEED
THIS SEED WAS CASED IN THE SAFETY OF THE LIGHT
IT NEEDED NOT A SHEATH OF IGNORANCE
THEN FROM THE TRANCE OF THAT TREMENDOUS CLASP
AND FROM THE THROBBINGS OF THAT SINGLE HEART
AND FROM THE NAKED SPIRIT'S VICTORY
A NEW AND MARVELLOUS CREATION ROSE
INCALCULABLE OUTFLOWING INFINITUDES
LAUGHING OUT AN UNMEASURED HAPPINESS
LIVED THEIR INNUMERABLE UNITY
WORLDS WHERE THE BEING IS UNBOUND AND WIDE
BODIED UNTHINKABLY THE EGOLESS SELF
RAPTURE OF BEATIFIC ENERGIES
JOINED TIME TO THE TIMELESS POLES OF A SINGLE JOY
WHITE VASTS WERE SEEN WHERE ALL IS WRAPPED IN ALL
THERE WERE NO CONTRARIES NO SUNDERED PARTS
ALL BY SPIRITUAL LINKS WERE JOINED TO ALL
AND BOUND INDISSOLUBLY TO THE ONE
EACH WAS UNIQUE BUT TOOK ALL LIVES AS HIS OWN
AND FOLLOWING OUT THESE TONES OF THE INFINITE
RECOGNISED IN HIMSELF THE UNIVERSE
A SPLENDID CENTRE OF INFINITY'S WHIRL
PUSHED TO ITS ZENITH'S HEIGHT ITS LAST EXPANSE
FELT THE DIVINITY OF ITS OWN SELF-BLISS
REPEATED IN ITS NUMBERLESS OTHER SELVES
IT TOOK UP TIRELESSLY INTO ITS SCOPE
PERSONS AND FIGURES OF THE IMPERSONAL
AS IF PROLONGING IN A CEASELESS COUNT
324
IN A RAPTUROUS MULTIPLICATION'S SUM
THE RECURRING DECIMALS OF ETERNITY
NONE WAS APART NONE LIVED FOR HIMSELF ALONE
EACH LIVED FOR GOD IN HIM AND GOD IN ALL
EACH SOLENESS INEXPRESSIBLY HELD THE WHOLE
THERE ONENESS WAS NOT TIED TO MONOTONE
IT SHOWED A THOUSAND ASPECTS OF ITSELF
ITS CALM IMMUTABLE STABILITY
UPBORE ON A CHANGELESS GROUND FOR EVER SAFE
COMPELLED TO A SPONTANEOUS SERVITUDE
THE EVER-CHANGING INCALCULABLE STEPS
THE SEEMING-RECKLESS DANCE'S SUBTLE PLAN
OF IMMENSE WORLD-FORCES IN THEIR PERFECT PLAY
APPEARANCE LOOKED BACK TO ITS HIDDEN TRUTH
AND MADE OF DIFFERENCE ONENESS' SMILING PLAY
IT MADE ALL PERSONS FRACTIONS OF THE UNIQUE
YET ALL WERE BEING'S SECRET INTEGERS
ALL STRUGGLE WAS TURNED TO A SWEET STRIFE OF LOVE
IN THE HARMONISED CIRCLE OF A SURE EMBRACE
IDENTITY'S RECONCILING HAPPINESS GAVE
A RICH SECURITY TO DIFFERENCE
ON A MEETING LINE OF HAZARDOUS EXTREMES
THE GAME OF GAMES WAS PLAYED TO ITS BREAKING-POINT
WHERE THROUGH SELF-FINDING BY DIVINE SELF-LOSS
THERE LEAPS OUT UNITY'S SUPREME DELIGHT
WHOSE BLISSFUL UNDIVIDED SWEETNESS FEELS
A COMMUNALITY OF THE ABSOLUTE
THERE WAS NO SOB OF SUFFERING ANYWHERE
EXPERIENCE RAN FROM POINT TO POINT OF JOY
BLISS WAS THE PURE UNDYING TRUTH OF THINGS
ALL NATURE WAS A CONSCIOUS FRONT OF GOD
A WISDOM WORKED IN ALL SELF-MOVED SELF-SURE
A PLENITUDE OF ILLIMITABLE LIGHT
AN AUTHENTICITY OF INTUITIVE TRUTH
A GLORY AND PASSION OF CREATIVE FORCE
INFALLIBLE LEAPING FROM ETERNITY
325
THE MOMENT'S THOUGHT INSPIRED THE PASSING ACT
A WORD A LAUGHTER SPRANG FROM SILENCE' BREAST
A RHYTHM OF BEAUTY IN THE CALM OF SPACE
A KNOWLEDGE IN THE FATHOMLESS HEART OF TIME
ALL TURNED TO ALL WITHOUT RESERVE'S RECOIL
A SINGLE ECSTASY WITHOUT A BREAK
LOVE WAS A CLOSE AND THRILLED IDENTITY
IN THE THROBBING HEART OF ALL THAT LUMINOUS LIFE
A UNIVERSAL VISION THAT UNITES
A SYMPATHY OF NERVE REPLYING TO NERVE
HEARING THAT LISTENS TO THOUGHT'S INNER SOUND
AND FOLLOWS THE RHYTHMIC MEANINGS OF THE HEART
A TOUCH THAT NEEDS NOT HANDS TO FEEL TO CLASP
WERE THERE THE NATIVE MEANS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AND HEIGHTENED THE INTIMACY OF SOUL WITH SOUL
A GRAND ORCHESTRA OF SPIRITUAL POWERS
A DIAPASON OF SOUL-INTERCHANGE
HARMONISED A ONENESS DEEP IMMEASURABLE
IN THESE NEW WORLDS PROJECTED HE BECAME
A PORTION OF THE UNIVERSAL GAZE
A STATION OF THE ALL-INHABITING LIGHT
A RIPPLE ON A SINGLE SEA OF PEACE
HIS MIND ANSWERED TO COUNTLESS COMMUNING MINDS
HIS WORDS WERE SYLLABLES OF THE COSMOS' SPEECH
HIS LIFE A FIELD OF THE VAST COSMIC STIR
HE FELT THE FOOTSTEPS OF A MILLION WILLS
MOVING IN UNISON TO A SINGLE GOAL
A STREAM EVER NEW-BORN THAT NEVER DIES
CAUGHT IN ITS THOUSANDFOLD CURRENT'S RAVISHING FLOW
WITH EDDIES OF IMMORTAL SWEETNESS THRILLED
HE BORE COILING THROUGH HIS MEMBERS AS THEY PASSED
CALM MOVEMENTS OF INTERMINABLE DELIGHT
THE BLISS OF A MYRIAD MYRIADS WHO ARE ONE
IN THIS VAST OUTBREAK OF PERFECTION'S LAW
IMPOSING ITS FIXITY ON THE FLUX OF THINGS
326
HE SAW A HIERARCHY OF LUCENT PLANES
ENFEOFFED TO THIS HIGHEST KINGDOM OF GOD-STATE
ATTUNING TO ONE TRUTH THEIR OWN RIGHT RULE
EACH HOUSED THE GLADNESS OF A BRIGHT DEGREE
ALONE IN BEAUTY PERFECT IN SELF-KIND
AN IMAGE CAST BY ONE DEEP TRUTH'S ABSOLUTE
MARRIED TO ALL IN HAPPY DIFFERENCE
EACH GAVE ITS POWERS TO HELP ITS NEIGHBOURS' PARTS
BUT SUFFERED NO DIMINUTION BY THE GIFT
PROFITEERS OF A MYSTIC INTERCHANGE
THEY GREW BY WHAT THEY TOOK AND WHAT THEY GAVE
ALL OTHERS THEY FELT AS THEIR OWN COMPLEMENTS
ONE IN THE MIGHT AND JOY OF MULTITUDE
EVEN IN THE POISE WHERE ONENESS DRAWS APART
TO FEEL THE RAPTURE OF ITS SEPARATE SELVES
THE SOLE IN ITS SOLITUDE YEARNED TOWARDS THE ALL
AND THE MANY TURNED TO LOOK BACK AT THE ONE
AN ALL-REVEALING ALL-CREATING BLISS
SEEKING FOR FORMS TO MANIFEST TRUTHS DIVINE
ALIGNED IN THEIR SIGNIFICANT MYSTERY
THE GLEAMS OF THE SYMBOLS OF THE INEFFABLE
BLAZONED LIKE HUES UPON A COLOURLESS AIR
ON THE WHITE PURITY OF THE WITNESS SOUL
THESE HUES WERE THE VERY PRISM OF THE SUPREME
HIS BEAUTY POWER DELIGHT CREATION'S CAUSE
A VAST TRUTH-CONSCIOUSNESS TOOK UP THESE SIGNS
TO PASS THEM ON TO SOME DIVINE CHILD HEART
THAT LOOKED ON THEM WITH LAUGHTER AND DELIGHT
AND JOYED IN THESE TRANSCENDENT IMAGES
LIVING AND REAL AS THE TRUTHS THEY HOUSE
THE SPIRIT'S WHITE NEUTRALITY BECAME
A PLAYGROUND OF MIRACLES A RENDEZVOUS
FOR THE SECRET POWERS OF A MYSTIC TIMELESSNESS
IT MADE OF SPACE A MARVEL HOUSE OF GOD
IT POURED THROUGH TIME ITS WORKS OF AGELESS MIGHT
UNVEILED SEEN AS A LURING RAPTUROUS FACE
327
THE WONDER AND BEAUTY OF ITS LOVE AND FORCE
THE ETERNAL GODDESS MOVED IN HER COSMIC HOUSE
SPORTING WITH GOD AS A MOTHER WITH HER CHILD
TO HIM THE UNIVERSE WAS HER BOSOM OF LOVE
HIS TOYS WERE THE IMMORTAL VERITIES
ALL HERE SELF-LOST HAD THERE ITS DIVINE PLACE
THE POWERS THAT HERE BETRAY OUR HEARTS AND ERR
WERE THERE SOVEREIGN IN TRUTH PERFECT IN JOY
MASTERS IN A CREATION WITHOUT FLAW
POSSESSORS OF THEIR OWN INFINITUDE
THERE MIND A SPLENDID SUN OF VISION'S RAYS
SHAPED SUBSTANCE BY THE GLORY OF ITS THOUGHTS
AND MOVED AMIDST THE GRANDEUR OF ITS DREAMS
IMAGINATION'S GREAT ENSORCELLING ROD
SUMMONED THE UNKNOWN AND GAVE TO IT A HOME
OUTSPREAD LUXURIANTLY IN GOLDEN AIR
TRUTH'S IRIS-COLOURED WINGS OF FANTASY
OR SANG TO THE INTUITIVE HEART OF JOY
WONDER'S DREAM-NOTES THAT BRING THE REAL CLOSE
ITS POWER THAT MAKES THE UNKNOWABLE NEAR AND TRUE
IN THE TEMPLE OF THE IDEAL SHRINED THE ONE
IT PEOPLED THOUGHT AND MIND AND HAPPY SENSE
FILLED WITH BRIGHT ASPECTS OF THE MIGHT OF GOD
AND LIVING PERSONS OF THE ONE SUPREME
THE SPEECH THAT VOICES THE INEFFABLE
THE RAY REVEALING UNSEEN PRESENCES
THE VIRGIN FORMS THROUGH WHICH THE FORMLESS SHINES
THE WORD THAT USHERS DIVINE EXPERIENCE
AND THE IDEAS THAT CROWD THE INFINITE
THERE WAS NO GULF BETWEEN THE THOUGHT AND FACT
EVER THEY REPLIED LIKE BIRD TO CALLING BIRD
THE WILL OBEYED THE THOUGHT THE ACT THE WILL
THERE WAS A HARMONY WOVEN TWIXT SOUL AND SOUL
A MARRIAGE WITH ETERNITY DIVINISED TIME
THERE LIFE PURSUED UNWEARIED OF HER SPORT
JOY IN HER HEART AND LAUGHTER ON HER LIPS
328
THE BRIGHT ADVENTURE OF GOD'S GAME OF CHANCE
IN HER INGENIOUS ARDOUR OF CAPRICE
IN HER TRANSFIGURING MIRTH SHE MAPPED ON TIME
A FASCINATING PUZZLE OF EVENTS
LURED AT EACH TURN BY NEW VICISSITUDES
TO SELF-DISCOVERY THAT COULD NEVER CEASE
EVER SHE FRAMED STARK BONDS FOR THE WILL TO BREAK
BROUGHT NEW CREATIONS FOR THE THOUGHT'S SURPRISE
AND PASSIONATE VENTURES FOR THE HEART TO DARE
WHERE TRUTH RECURRED WITH AN UNEXPECTED FACE
OR ELSE REPEATED OLD FAMILIAR JOY
LIKE THE RETURN OF A DELIGHTFUL RHYME
AT HIDE-AND-SEEK ON A MOTHER-WISDOM'S BREAST
AN ARTIST TEEMING WITH HER WORLD-IDEA
SHE NEVER COULD EXHAUST ITS NUMBERLESS THOUGHTS
AND VAST ADVENTURE INTO THINKING SHAPES
AND TRIAL AND LURE OF A NEW LIVING'S DREAMS
UNTIRED OF SAMENESS AND UNTIRED OF CHANGE
ENDLESSLY SHE UNROLLED HER MOVING ACT
A MYSTERY DRAMA OF DIVINE DELIGHT
A LIVING POEM OF WORLD-ECSTASY
A KAKEMONO OF SIGNIFICANT FORMS
A COILED PERSPECTIVE OF DEVELOPING SCENES
A BRILLIANT CHASE OF SELF-REVEALING SHAPES
AN ARDENT HUNT OF SOUL LOOKING FOR SOUL
A SEEKING AND A FINDING AS OF GODS
THERE MATTER IS THE SPIRIT'S FIRM DENSITY
AN ARTISTRY OF GLAD OUTWARDNESS OF SELF
A TREASURE-HOUSE OF LASTING IMAGES
WHERE SENSE CAN BUILD A WORLD OF PURE DELIGHT
THE HOME OF A PERPETUAL HAPPINESS
IT LODGED THE HOURS AS IN A PLEASANT INN
THE SENSES THERE WERE OUTLETS OF THE SOUL
EVEN THE YOUNGEST CHILD-THOUGHT OF THE MIND
INCARNATED SOME TOUCH OF HIGHEST THINGS
THERE SUBSTANCE WAS A RESONANT HARP OF SELF
329
A NET FOR THE CONSTANT LIGHTNINGS OF THE SPIRIT
A MAGNET POWER OF LOVE'S INTENSITY
WHOSE YEARNING THROB AND ADORATION'S CRY
DREW GOD'S APPROACHES CLOSE SWEET WONDERFUL
ITS SOLIDITY WAS A MASS OF HEAVENLY MAKE
ITS FIXITY AND SWEET PERMANENCE OF CHARM
MADE A BRIGHT PEDESTAL FOR FELICITY
ITS BODIES WOVEN BY A DIVINE SENSE
PROLONGED THE NEARNESS OF SOUL'S CLASP WITH SOUL
ITS WARM PLAY OF EXTERNAL SIGHT AND TOUCH
REFLECTED THE GLOW AND THRILL OF THE HEART'S JOY
MIND'S CLIMBING BRILLIANT THOUGHTS THE SPIRIT'S BLISS
LIFE'S RAPTURE KEPT FOR EVER ITS FLAME AND CRY
ALL THAT NOW PASSES LIVED IMMORTAL THERE
IN THE PROUD BEAUTY AND FINE HARMONY
OF MATTER PLASTIC TO SPIRITUAL LIGHT
ITS ORDERED HOURS PROCLAIMED THE ETERNAL LAW
VISION REPOSED ON A SAFETY OF DEATHLESS FORMS
TIME WAS ETERNITY'S TRANSPARENT ROBE
AN ARCHITECT HEWING OUT SELF'S LIVING ROCK
PHENOMENON BUILT REALITY'S SUMMER-HOUSE
ON THE BEACHES OF THE SEA OF INFINITY
AGAINST THIS GLORY OF SPIRITUAL STATES
THEIR PARALLELS AND YET THEIR OPPOSITES
FLOATED AND SWAYED ECLIPSED AND SHADOWLIKE
AS IF A DOUBT MADE SUBSTANCE FLICKERING PALE
THIS OTHER SCHEME TWO VAST NEGATIONS FOUND
A WORLD THAT KNOWS NOT ITS INHABITING SELF
LABOURS TO FIND ITS CAUSE AND NEED TO BE
A SPIRIT IGNORANT OF THE WORLD IT MADE
OBSCURED BY MATTER TRAVESTIED BY LIFE
STRUGGLES TO EMERGE TO BE FREE TO KNOW AND REIGN
THESE WERE CLOSE-TIED IN ONE DISHARMONY
YET THE DIVERGENT LINES MET NOT AT ALL
THREE POWERS GOVERNED ITS IRRATIONAL COURSE
330
IN THE BEGINNING AN UNKNOWING FORCE
IN THE MIDDLE AN EMBODIED STRIVING SOUL
IN ITS END A SILENT SPIRIT DENYING LIFE
A DULL AND INFELICITOUS INTERLUDE
UNROLLS ITS DUBIOUS TRUTH TO A QUESTIONING MIND
COMPELLED BY THE IGNORANT POWER TO PLAY ITS PART
AND TO RECORD HER INCONCLUSIVE TALE
THE MYSTERY OF HER INCONSCIENT PLAN
AND THE RIDDLE OF A BEING BORN FROM NIGHT
BY A MARRIAGE OF NECESSITY WITH CHANCE
THIS DARKNESS HIDES OUR NOBLER DESTINY
A CHRYSALIS OF A GREAT AND GLORIOUS TRUTH
IT STIFLES THE WINGED MARVEL IN ITS SHEATH
LEST FROM THE PRISON OF MATTER IT ESCAPE
AND WASTING ITS BEAUTY ON THE FORMLESS VAST
MERGED INTO THE UNKNOWABLE'S MYSTERY
LEAVE UNFULFILLED THE WORLD'S MIRACULOUS FATE
AS YET THOUGHT ONLY SOME HIGH SPIRIT'S DREAM
OR A VEXED ILLUSION IN MAN'S TOILING MIND
A NEW CREATION FROM THE OLD SHALL RISE
A KNOWLEDGE INARTICULATE FIND SPEECH
BEAUTY SUPPRESSED BURST INTO PARADISE BLOOM
PLEASURE AND PAIN DIVE INTO ABSOLUTE BLISS
A TONGUELESS ORACLE SHALL SPEAK AT LAST
THE SUPERCONSCIENT CONSCIOUS GROW ON EARTH
THE ETERNAL'S WONDERS JOIN THE DANCE OF TIME
BUT NOW ALL SEEMED A VAINLY TEEMING VAST
UPHELD BY A DELUDED ENERGY
TO A SPECTATOR SELF-ABSORBED AND MUTE
CARELESS OF THE UNMEANING SHOW HE WATCHED
REGARDING THE BIZARRE PROCESSION PASS
LIKE ONE WHO WAITS FOR AN EXPECTED END
HE SAW A WORLD THAT IS FROM A WORLD TO BE
THERE HE DIVINED RATHER THAN SAW OR FELT
FAR OFF UPON THE RIM OF CONSCIOUSNESS
TRANSIENT AND FRAIL THIS LITTLE WHIRLING GLOBE
331
AND ON IT LEFT LIKE A LOST DREAM'S VAIN MOULD
A FRAGILE COPY OF THE SPIRIT'S SHELL
HIS BODY GATHERED INTO MYSTIC SLEEP
A FOREIGN SHAPE IT SEEMED A MYTHIC SHADE
ALIEN NOW SEEMED THAT DIM FAR UNIVERSE
SELF AND ETERNITY ALONE WERE TRUE
THEN MEMORY CLIMBED TO HIM FROM THE STRIVING PLANES
BRINGING A CRY FROM ONCE-LOVED CHERISHED THINGS
AND TO THE CRY AS TO ITS OWN LOST CALL
A RAY REPLIED FROM THE OCCULT SUPREME
FOR EVEN THERE THE BOUNDLESS ONENESS DWELLS
TO ITS OWN SIGHT UNRECOGNISABLE
IT LIVED STILL SUNK IN ITS OWN TENEBROUS SEAS
UPHOLDING THE WORLD'S INCONSCIENT UNITY
HIDDEN IN MATTER'S INSENTIENT MULTITUDE
THIS SEED-SELF SOWN IN THE INDETERMINATE
FORFEITS ITS GLORY OF DIVINITY
CONCEALING THE OMNIPOTENCE OF ITS FORCE
CONCEALING THE OMNISCIENCE OF ITS SOUL
AN AGENT OF ITS OWN TRANSCENDENT WILL
IT MERGES KNOWLEDGE IN THE INCONSCIENT DEEP
ACCEPTING ERROR SORROW DEATH AND PAIN
IT PAYS THE RANSOM OF THE IGNORANT NIGHT
REDEEMING BY ITS SUBSTANCE NATURE'S FALL
HIMSELF HE KNEW AND WHY HIS SOUL HAD GONE
INTO EARTH'S PASSIONATE OBSCURITY
TO SHARE THE LABOUR OF AN ERRANT POWER
WHICH BY DIVISION HOPES TO FIND THE ONE
TWO BEINGS HE WAS ONE WIDE AND FREE ABOVE
ONE STRUGGLING BOUND INTENSE ITS PORTION HERE
A TIE BETWEEN THEM STILL COULD BRIDGE TWO WORLDS
THERE WAS A DIM RESPONSE A DISTANT BREATH
ALL HAD NOT CEASED IN THE UNBOUNDED HUSH
HIS HEART LAY SOMEWHERE CONSCIOUS AND ALONE
FAR DOWN BELOW HIM LIKE A LAMP IN NIGHT
332
ABANDONED IT LAY ALONE IMPERISHABLE
IMMOBILE WITH EXCESS OF PASSIONATE WILL
HIS LIVING SACRIFICED AND OFFERED HEART
ABSORBED IN ADORATION MYSTICAL
TURNED TO ITS FAR-OFF FOUNT OF LIGHT AND LOVE
IN THE LUMINOUS STILLNESS OF ITS MUTE APPEAL
IT LOOKED UP TO THE HEIGHTS IT COULD NOT SEE
IT YEARNED FROM THE LONGING DEPTHS IT COULD NOT LEAVE
IN THE CENTRE OF HIS VAST AND FATEFUL TRANCE
HALF-WAY BETWEEN HIS FREE AND FALLEN SELVES
INTERCEDING TWIXT GOD'S DAY AND THE MORTAL'S NIGHT
ACCEPTING WORSHIP AS ITS SINGLE LAW
ACCEPTING BLISS AS THE SOLE CAUSE OF THINGS
REFUSING THE AUSTERE JOY WHICH NONE CAN SHARE
REFUSING THE CALM THAT LIVES FOR CALM ALONE
TO HER IT TURNED FOR WHOM IT WILLED TO BE
IN THE PASSION OF ITS SOLITARY DREAM
IT LAY LIKE A CLOSED SOUNDLESS ORATORY
WHERE SLEEPS A CONSECRATED ARGENT FLOOR
LIT BY A SINGLE AND UNTREMBLING RAY
AND AN INVISIBLE PRESENCE KNEELS IN PRAYER
ON SOME DEEP BREAST OF LIBERATING PEACE
ALL ELSE WAS SATISFIED WITH QUIETUDE
THIS ONLY KNEW THERE WAS A TRUTH BEYOND
ALL OTHER PARTS WERE DUMB IN CENTRED SLEEP
CONSENTING TO THE SLOW DELIBERATE POWER
WHICH TOLERATES THE WORLD'S ERROR AND ITS GRIEF
CONSENTING TO THE COSMIC LONG DELAY
TIMELESSLY WAITING THROUGH THE PATIENT YEARS
HER COMING THEY HAD ASKED FOR EARTH AND MEN
THIS WAS THE FIERY POINT THAT CALLED HER NOW
EXTINCTION COULD NOT QUENCH THAT LONELY FIRE
ITS SEEING FILLED THE BLANK OF MIND AND WILL
THOUGHT DEAD ITS CHANGELESS FORCE ABODE AND GREW
ARMED WITH THE INTUITION OF A BLISS
TO WHICH SOME MOVED TRANQUILLITY WAS THE KEY
333
IT PERSEVERED THROUGH LIFE'S HUGE EMPTINESS
AMID THE BLANK DENIALS OF THE WORLD
IT SENT ITS VOICELESS PRAYER TO THE UNKNOWN
IT LISTENED FOR THE FOOTSTEPS OF ITS HOPES
RETURNING THROUGH THE VOID IMMENSITIES
IT WAITED FOR THE FIAT OF THE WORD
THAT COMES THROUGH THE STILL SELF FROM THE SUPREME
334
THEN SUDDENLY THERE ROSE A SACRED STIR
AMID THE LIFELESS SILENCE OF THE VOID
IN A SOLITUDE AND AN IMMENSITY
A SOUND CAME QUIVERING LIKE A LOVED FOOTFALL
HEARD IN THE LISTENING SPACES OF THE SOUL
A TOUCH PERTURBED HIS FIBRES WITH DELIGHT
AN INFLUENCE HAD APPROACHED THE MORTAL RANGE
A BOUNDLESS HEART WAS NEAR HIS LONGING HEART
A MYSTIC FORM ENVELOPED HIS EARTHLY SHAPE
ALL AT HER CONTACT BROKE FROM SILENCE' SEAL
SPIRIT AND BODY THRILLED IDENTIFIED
LINKED IN THE GRASP OF AN UNSPOKEN JOY
MIND MEMBERS LIFE WERE MERGED IN ECSTASY
INTOXICATED AS WITH NECTAROUS RAIN
HIS NATURE'S PASSIONING STRETCHES FLOWED TO HER
FLASHING WITH LIGHTNINGS MAD WITH LUMINOUS WINE
ALL WAS A LIMITLESS SEA THAT HEAVED TO THE MOON
A DIVINISING STREAM POSSESSED HIS VEINS
HIS BODY'S CELLS AWOKE TO SPIRIT SENSE
EACH NERVE BECAME A BURNING THREAD OF JOY
TISSUE AND FLESH PARTOOK BEATITUDE
ALIGHT THE DUN UNPLUMBED SUBCONSCIENT CAVES
THRILLED WITH THE PRESCIENCE OF HER LONGED-FOR TREAD
AND FILLED WITH FLICKERING CRESTS AND PRAYING TONGUES
EVEN LOST IN SLUMBER MUTE INANIMATE
HIS VERY BODY ANSWERED TO HER POWER
THE ONE HE WORSHIPPED WAS WITHIN HIM NOW
FLAME-PURE ETHEREAL-TRESSED A MIGHTY FACE
APPEARED AND LIPS MOVED BY IMMORTAL WORDS
LIDS WISDOM'S LEAVES DROOPED OVER RAPTURE'S ORBS
A MARBLE MONUMENT OF PONDERINGS SHONE
335
A FOREHEAD SIGHT'S CRYPT AND LARGE LIKE OCEAN'S GAZE
TOWARDS HEAVEN TWO TRANQUIL EYES OF BOUNDLESS THOUGHT
LOOKED INTO MAN'S AND SAW THE GOD TO COME
A SHAPE WAS SEEN ON THRESHOLD MIND A VOICE
ABSOLUTE AND WISE IN THE HEART'S CHAMBERS SPOKE
O SON OF STRENGTH WHO CLIMBST CREATION'S PEAKS
NO SOUL IS THY COMPANION IN THE LIGHT
ALONE THOU STANDEST AT THE ETERNAL DOORS
WHAT THOU HAST WON IS THINE BUT ASK NO MORE
O SPIRIT ASPIRING IN AN IGNORANT FRAME
O VOICE ARISEN FROM THE INCONSCIENT'S WORLD
HOW SHALT THOU SPEAK FOR MEN WHOSE HEARTS ARE DUMB
MAKE PURBLIND EARTH THE SOUL'S SEER-VISION'S HOME
OR LIGHTEN THE BURDEN OF THE SENSELESS GLOBE
I AM THE MYSTERY BEYOND REACH OF MIND
I AM THE GOAL OF THE TRAVAIL OF THE SUNS
MY FIRE AND SWEETNESS ARE THE CAUSE OF LIFE
BUT TOO IMMENSE MY DANGER AND MY JOY
AWAKE NOT THE IMMEASURABLE DESCENT
SPEAK NOT MY SECRET NAME TO HOSTILE TIME
MAN IS TOO WEAK TO BEAR THE INFINITE'S WEIGHT
TRUTH BORN TOO SOON MIGHT BREAK THE IMPERFECT EARTH
LEAVE THE ALL-SEEING POWER TO HEW ITS WAY
IN THY SINGLE VAST ACHIEVEMENT REIGN APART
HELPING THE WORLD WITH THY GREAT LONELY DAYS
I ASK THEE NOT TO MERGE THY HEART OF FLAME
IN THE IMMOBILE'S WIDE UNCARING BLISS
TURNED FROM THE FRUITLESS MOTION OF THE YEARS
DESERTING THE FIERCE LABOUR OF THE WORLDS
ALOOF FROM BEINGS LOST IN THE ALONE
HOW SHALL THY MIGHTY SPIRIT BROOK REPOSE
WHILE DEATH IS STILL UNCONQUERED ON THE EARTH
AND TIME A FIELD OF SUFFERING AND PAIN
THY SOUL WAS BORN TO SHARE THE LADEN FORCE
OBEY THY NATURE AND FULFIL THY FATE
ACCEPT THE DIFFICULTY AND GODLIKE TOIL
336
FOR THE SLOW-PACED OMNISCIENT PURPOSE LIVE
THE ENIGMA'S KNOT IS TIED IN HUMANKIND
A LIGHTNING FROM THE HEIGHTS THAT THINK AND PLAN
PLOUGHING THE AIR OF LIFE WITH VANISHING TRAILS
MAN SOLE AWAKE IN AN UNCONSCIOUS WORLD
ASPIRES IN VAIN TO CHANGE THE COSMIC DREAM
ARRIVED FROM SOME HALF-LUMINOUS BEYOND
HE IS A STRANGER IN THE MINDLESS VASTS
A TRAVELLER IN HIS OFT-SHIFTING HOME
AMID THE TREAD OF MANY INFINITIES
HE HAS PITCHED A TENT OF LIFE IN DESERT SPACE
HEAVEN'S FIXED REGARD BEHOLDS HIM FROM ABOVE
IN THE HOUSE OF NATURE A PERTURBING GUEST
A VOYAGER TWIXT THOUGHT'S INCONSTANT SHORES
A HUNTER OF UNKNOWN AND BEAUTIFUL POWERS
A NOMAD OF THE FAR MYSTERIOUS LIGHT
IN THE WIDE WAYS A LITTLE SPARK OF GOD
AGAINST HIS SPIRIT ALL IS IN DIRE LEAGUE
A TITAN INFLUENCE STOPS HIS GODWARD GAZE
AROUND HIM HUNGERS THE UNPITYING VOID
THE ETERNAL DARKNESS SEEKS HIM WITH HER HANDS
INSCRUTABLE ENERGIES DRIVE HIM AND DECEIVE
IMMENSE IMPLACABLE DEITIES OPPOSE
AN INERT SOUL AND A SOMNAMBULIST FORCE
HAVE MADE A WORLD ESTRANGED FROM LIFE AND THOUGHT
THE DRAGON OF THE DARK FOUNDATIONS KEEPS
UNALTERABLE THE LAW OF CHANCE AND DEATH
ON HIS LONG WAY THROUGH TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCE
THE GREY-HUED RIDDLING NETHER SHADOW-SPHINX
HER DREADFUL PAWS UPON THE SWALLOWING SANDS
AWAITS HIM ARMED WITH THE SOUL-SLAYING WORD
ACROSS HIS PATH SITS THE DIM CAMP OF NIGHT
HIS DAY IS A MOMENT IN PERPETUAL TIME
HE IS THE PREY OF THE MINUTES AND THE HOURS
ASSAILED ON EARTH AND UNASSURED OF HEAVEN
DESCENDED HERE UNHAPPY AND SUBLIME
337
A LINK BETWEEN THE DEMIGOD AND THE BEAST
HE KNOWS NOT HIS OWN GREATNESS NOR HIS AIM
HE HAS FORGOTTEN WHY HE HAS COME AND WHENCE
HIS SPIRIT AND HIS MEMBERS ARE AT WAR
HIS HEIGHTS BREAK OFF TOO LOW TO REACH THE SKIES
HIS MASS IS BURIED IN THE ANIMAL MIRE
A STRANGE ANTINOMY IS HIS NATURE'S RULE
A RIDDLE OF OPPOSITES IS MADE HIS FIELD
FREEDOM HE ASKS BUT NEEDS TO LIVE IN BONDS
HE HAS NEED OF DARKNESS TO PERCEIVE SOME LIGHT
AND NEED OF GRIEF TO FEEL A LITTLE BLISS
HE HAS NEED OF DEATH TO FIND A GREATER LIFE
ALL SIDES HE SEES AND TURNS TO EVERY CALL
HE HAS NO CERTAIN LIGHT BY WHICH TO WALK
HIS LIFE IS A BLIND-MAN'S-BUFF A HIDE-AND-SEEK
HE SEEKS HIMSELF AND FROM HIMSELF HE RUNS
MEETING HIMSELF HE THINKS IT OTHER THAN HE
ALWAYS HE BUILDS BUT FINDS NO CONSTANT GROUND
ALWAYS HE JOURNEYS BUT NOWHERE ARRIVES
HE WOULD GUIDE THE WORLD HIMSELF HE CANNOT GUIDE
HE WOULD SAVE HIS SOUL HIS LIFE HE CANNOT SAVE
THE LIGHT HIS SOUL HAD BROUGHT HIS MIND HAS LOST
ALL HE HAS LEARNED IS SOON AGAIN IN DOUBT
A SUN TO HIM SEEMS THE SHADOW OF HIS THOUGHTS
THEN ALL IS SHADOW AGAIN AND NOTHING TRUE
UNKNOWING WHAT HE DOES OR WHITHER HE TENDS
HE FABRICATES SIGNS OF THE REAL IN IGNORANCE
HE HAS HITCHED HIS MORTAL ERROR TO TRUTH'S STAR
WISDOM ATTRACTS HIM WITH HER LUMINOUS MASKS
BUT NEVER HAS HE SEEN THE FACE BEHIND
A GIANT IGNORANCE SURROUNDS HIS LORE
ASSIGNED TO MEET THE COSMIC MYSTERY
IN THE DUMB FIGURE OF A MATERIAL WORLD
HIS PASSPORT OF ENTRY FALSE AND HIS PERSONAGE
HE IS COMPELLED TO BE WHAT HE IS NOT
HE OBEYS THE INCONSCIENCE HE HAD COME TO RULE
338
AND SINKS IN MATTER TO FULFIL HIS SOUL
AWAKENED FROM HER LOWER DRIVEN FORMS
THE EARTH-MOTHER GAVE HER FORCES TO HIS HANDS
AND PAINFULLY HE GUARDS THE HEAVY TRUST
HIS MIND IS A LOST TORCH-BEARER ON HER ROADS
ILLUMINING BREATH TO THINK AND PLASM TO FEEL
HE LABOURS WITH HIS SLOW AND SCEPTIC BRAIN
HELPED BY THE REASON'S VACILLATING FIRES
TO MAKE HIS THOUGHT AND WILL A MAGIC DOOR
FOR KNOWLEDGE TO ENTER THE DARKNESS OF THE WORLD
AND LOVE TO RULE A REALM OF STRIFE AND HATE
A MIND IMPOTENT TO RECONCILE HEAVEN AND EARTH
AND TIED TO MATTER WITH A THOUSAND BONDS
HE LIFTS HIMSELF TO BE A CONSCIOUS GOD
EVEN WHEN A GLORY OF WISDOM CROWNS HIS BROW
WHEN MIND AND SPIRIT SHED A GRANDIOSE RAY
TO EXALT THIS PRODUCT OF THE SPERM AND GENE
THIS ALCHEMIST'S MIRACLE FROM PLASM AND GAS
AND HE WHO SHARED THE ANIMAL'S RUN AND CRAWL
LIFTS HIS THOUGHT-STATURE TO THE IMMORTAL'S HEIGHTS
HIS LIFE STILL KEEPS THE HUMAN MIDDLE WAY
HIS BODY HE RESIGNS TO DEATH AND PAIN
ABANDONING MATTER HIS TOO HEAVY CHARGE
A THAUMATURGE SCEPTIC OF MIRACLES
A SPIRIT LEFT STERILE OF ITS OCCULT POWER
BY AN UNBELIEVING BRAIN AND CREDULOUS HEART
HE LEAVES THE WORLD TO END WHERE IT BEGAN
HIS WORK UNFINISHED HE CLAIMS A HEAVENLY PRIZE
THUS HAS HE MISSED CREATION'S ABSOLUTE
HALF-WAY HE STOPS HIS STAR OF DESTINY
A VAST AND VAIN LONG-TRIED EXPERIMENT
AN ILL-SERVED HIGH CONCEPTION DOUBTFULLY DONE
THE WORLD'S LIFE FALTERS ON NOT SEEING ITS GOAL
A ZIGZAG TOWARDS UNKNOWN DANGEROUS GROUND
EVER REPEATING ITS HABITUAL WALK
EVER RETREATING AFTER MARCHES LONG
339
AND HARDIEST VICTORIES WITHOUT SURE RESULT
DRAWN ENDLESSLY AN INCONCLUSIVE GAME
IN AN ILL-FITTING AND VOLUMINOUS ROBE
A RADIANT PURPOSE STILL CONCEALS ITS FACE
A MIGHTY BLINDNESS STUMBLES HOPING ON
FEEDING ITS STRENGTH ON GIFTS OF LUMINOUS CHANCE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN INSTRUMENT HAS FAILED
THE GODHEAD FRUSTRATE SLEEPS WITHIN ITS SEED
A SPIRIT ENTANGLED IN THE FORMS IT MADE
HIS FAILURE IS NOT FAILURE WHOM GOD LEADS
THROUGH ALL THE SLOW MYSTERIOUS MARCH GOES ON
AN IMMUTABLE POWER HAS MADE THIS MUTABLE WORLD
A SELF-FULFILLING TRANSCENDENCE TREADS MAN'S ROAD
THE DRIVER OF THE SOUL UPON ITS PATH
IT KNOWS ITS STEPS ITS WAY IS INEVITABLE
AND HOW SHALL THE END BE VAIN WHEN GOD IS GUIDE
HOWEVER MAN'S MIND MAY TIRE OR FAIL HIS FLESH
A WILL PREVAILS CANCELLING HIS CONSCIOUS CHOICE
THE GOAL RECEDES A BOURNELESS VASTNESS CALLS
RETREATING INTO AN IMMENSE UNKNOWN
THERE IS NO END TO THE WORLD'S STUPENDOUS MARCH
THERE IS NO REST FOR THE EMBODIED SOUL
IT MUST LIVE ON DESCRIBE ALL TIME'S HUGE CURVE
AN INFLUX PRESSES FROM THE CLOSED BEYOND
FORBIDDING TO HIM REST AND EARTHLY EASE
TILL HE HAS FOUND HIMSELF HE CANNOT PAUSE
A LIGHT THERE IS THAT LEADS A POWER THAT AIDS
UNMARKED UNFELT IT SEES IN HIM AND ACTS
IGNORANT HE FORMS THE ALL-CONSCIENT IN HIS DEPTHS
HUMAN LOOKS UP TO SUPERHUMAN PEAKS
A BORROWER OF SUPERNATURE'S GOLD
HE PAVES HIS ROAD TO IMMORTALITY
THE HIGH GODS LOOK ON MAN AND WATCH AND CHOOSE
TODAY'S IMPOSSIBLES FOR THE FUTURE'S BASE
HIS TRANSIENCE TREMBLES WITH THE ETERNAL'S TOUCH
HIS BARRIERS CEDE BENEATH THE INFINITE'S TREAD
340
THE IMMORTALS HAVE THEIR ENTRIES IN HIS LIFE
THE AMBASSADORS OF THE UNSEEN DRAW NEAR
A SPLENDOUR SULLIED BY THE MORTAL AIR
LOVE PASSES THROUGH HIS HEART A WANDERING GUEST
BEAUTY SURROUNDS HIM FOR A MAGIC HOUR
HE HAS VISITS OF A LARGE REVEALING JOY
BRIEF WIDENESSES RELEASE HIM FROM HIMSELF
ENTICING TOWARDS A GLORY EVER IN FRONT
HOPES OF A DEATHLESS SWEETNESS LURE AND LEAVE
HIS MIND IS CROSSED BY STRANGE DISCOVERING FIRES
RARE INTIMATIONS LIFT HIS STUMBLING SPEECH
TO A MOMENT'S KINSHIP WITH THE ETERNAL WORD
A MASQUE OF WISDOM CIRCLES THROUGH HIS BRAIN
PERTURBING HIM WITH GLIMPSES HALF DIVINE
HE LAYS HIS HANDS SOMETIMES ON THE UNKNOWN
HE COMMUNES SOMETIMES WITH ETERNITY
A STRANGE AND GRANDIOSE SYMBOL WAS HIS BIRTH
AND IMMORTALITY AND SPIRIT-ROOM
AND PURE PERFECTION AND A SHADOWLESS BLISS
ARE THIS AFFLICTED CREATURE'S MIGHTY FATE
IN HIM THE EARTH-MOTHER SEES DRAW NEAR THE CHANGE
FORESHADOWED IN HER DUMB AND FIERY DEPTHS
A GODHEAD DRAWN FROM HER TRANSMUTED LIMBS
AN ALCHEMY OF HEAVEN ON NATURE'S BASE
ADEPT OF THE SELF-BORN UNFAILING LINE
LEAVE NOT THE LIGHT TO DIE THE AGES BORE
HELP STILL HUMANITY'S BLIND AND SUFFERING LIFE
OBEY THY SPIRIT'S WIDE OMNIPOTENT URGE
A WITNESS TO GOD'S PARLEY WITH THE NIGHT
IT LEANED COMPASSIONATE FROM IMMORTAL CALM
AND HOUSED DESIRE THE TROUBLED SEED OF THINGS
ASSENT TO THY HIGH SELF CREATE ENDURE
CEASE NOT FROM KNOWLEDGE LET THY TOIL BE VAST
NO MORE CAN EARTHLY LIMITS PEN THY FORCE
EQUAL THY WORK WITH LONG UNENDING TIME'S
TRAVELLER UPON THE BARE ETERNAL HEIGHTS
341
TREAD STILL THE DIFFICULT AND DATELESS PATH
JOINING THE CYCLES WITH ITS AUSTERE CURVE
MEASURED FOR MAN BY THE INITIATE GODS
MY LIGHT SHALL BE IN THEE MY STRENGTH THY FORCE
LET NOT THE IMPATIENT TITAN DRIVE THY HEART
ASK NOT THE IMPERFECT FRUIT THE PARTIAL PRIZE
ONLY ONE BOON TO GREATEN THY SPIRIT DEMAND
ONLY ONE JOY TO RAISE THY KIND DESIRE
ABOVE BLIND FATE AND THE ANTAGONIST POWERS
MOVELESS THERE STANDS A HIGH UNCHANGING WILL
TO ITS OMNIPOTENCE LEAVE THY WORK'S RESULT
ALL THINGS SHALL CHANGE IN GOD'S TRANSFIGURING HOUR
AUGUST AND SWEET SANK HUSHED THAT MIGHTY VOICE
NOTHING NOW MOVED IN THE VAST BROODING SPACE
A STILLNESS CAME UPON THE LISTENING WORLD
A MUTE IMMENSITY OF THE ETERNAL'S PEACE
BUT ASWAPATI'S HEART REPLIED TO HER
A CRY AMID THE SILENCE OF THE VASTS
HOW SHALL I REST CONTENT WITH MORTAL DAYS
AND THE DULL MEASURE OF TERRESTRIAL THINGS
I WHO HAVE SEEN BEHIND THE COSMIC MASK
THE GLORY AND THE BEAUTY OF THY FACE
HARD IS THE DOOM TO WHICH THOU BINDST THY SONS
HOW LONG SHALL OUR SPIRITS BATTLE WITH THE NIGHT
AND BEAR DEFEAT AND THE BRUTE YOKE OF DEATH
WE WHO ARE VESSELS OF A DEATHLESS FORCE
AND BUILDERS OF THE GODHEAD OF THE RACE
OR IF IT IS THY WORK I DO BELOW
AMID THE ERROR AND WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE
IN THE VAGUE LIGHT OF MAN'S HALF-CONSCIOUS MIND
WHY BREAKS NOT IN SOME DISTANT GLEAM OF THEE
EVER THE CENTURIES AND MILLENNIUMS PASS
WHERE IN THE GREYNESS IS THY COMING'S RAY
WHERE IS THE THUNDER OF THY VICTORY'S WINGS
ONLY WE HEAR THE FEET OF PASSING GODS
342
A PLAN IN THE OCCULT ETERNAL MIND
MAPPED OUT TO BACKWARD AND PROPHETIC SIGHT
THE AEONS EVER REPEAT THEIR CHANGELESS ROUND
THE CYCLES ALL REBUILD AND EVER ASPIRE
ALL WE HAVE DONE IS EVER STILL TO DO
ALL BREAKS AND ALL RENEWS AND IS THE SAME
HUGE REVOLUTIONS OF LIFE'S FRUITLESS GYRE
THE NEW-BORN AGES PERISH LIKE THE OLD
AS IF THE SAD ENIGMA KEPT ITS RIGHT
TILL ALL IS DONE FOR WHICH THIS SCENE WAS MADE
TOO LITTLE THE STRENGTH THAT NOW WITH US IS BORN
TOO FAINT THE LIGHT THAT STEALS THROUGH NATURE'S LIDS
TOO SCANT THE JOY WITH WHICH SHE BUYS OUR PAIN
IN A BRUTE WORLD THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN SENSE
THOUGHT-RACKED UPON THE WHEEL OF BIRTH WE LIVE
THE INSTRUMENTS OF AN IMPULSE NOT OUR OWN
MOVED TO ACHIEVE WITH OUR HEART'S BLOOD FOR PRICE
HALF-KNOWLEDGE HALF-CREATIONS THAT SOON TIRE
A FOILED IMMORTAL SOUL IN PERISHING LIMBS
BAFFLED AND BEATEN BACK WE LABOUR STILL
ANNULLED FRUSTRATED SPENT WE STILL SURVIVE
IN ANGUISH WE LABOUR THAT FROM US MAY RISE
A LARGER-SEEING MAN WITH NOBLER HEART
A GOLDEN VESSEL OF THE INCARNATE TRUTH
THE EXECUTOR OF THE DIVINE ATTEMPT
EQUIPPED TO WEAR THE EARTHLY BODY OF GOD
COMMUNICANT AND PROPHET AND LOVER AND KING
I KNOW THAT THY CREATION CANNOT FAIL
FOR EVEN THROUGH THE MISTS OF MORTAL THOUGHT
INFALLIBLE ARE THY MYSTERIOUS STEPS
AND THOUGH NECESSITY DONS THE GARB OF CHANCE
HIDDEN IN THE BLIND SHIFTS OF FATE SHE KEEPS
THE SLOW CALM LOGIC OF INFINITY'S PACE
AND THE INVIOLATE SEQUENCE OF ITS WILL
ALL LIFE IS FIXED IN AN ASCENDING SCALE
AND ADAMANTINE IS THE EVOLVING LAW
343
IN THE BEGINNING IS PREPARED THE CLOSE
THIS STRANGE IRRATIONAL PRODUCT OF THE MIRE
THIS COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE BEAST AND GOD
IS NOT THE CROWN OF THY MIRACULOUS WORLD
I KNOW THERE SHALL INFORM THE INCONSCIENT CELLS
AT ONE WITH NATURE AND AT HEIGHT WITH HEAVEN
A SPIRIT VAST AS THE CONTAINING SKY
AND SWEPT WITH ECSTASY FROM INVISIBLE FOUNTS
A GOD COME DOWN AND GREATER BY THE FALL
A POWER AROSE OUT OF MY SLUMBER'S CELL
ABANDONING THE TARDY LIMP OF THE HOURS
AND THE INCONSTANT BLINK OF MORTAL SIGHT
THERE WHERE THE THINKER SLEEPS IN TOO MUCH LIGHT
AND INTOLERANT FLAMES THE LONE ALL-WITNESSING EYE
HEARING THE WORD OF FATE FROM SILENCE' HEART
IN THE ENDLESS MOMENT OF ETERNITY
IT SAW FROM TIMELESSNESS THE WORKS OF TIME
OVERPASSED WERE THE LEADEN FORMULAS OF THE MIND
OVERPOWERED THE OBSTACLE OF MORTAL SPACE
THE UNFOLDING IMAGE SHOWED THE THINGS TO COME
A GIANT DANCE OF SHIVA TORE THE PAST
THERE WAS A THUNDER AS OF WORLDS THAT FALL
EARTH WAS O'ERRUN WITH FIRE AND THE ROAR OF DEATH
CLAMOURING TO SLAY A WORLD HIS HUNGER HAD MADE
THERE WAS A CLANGOUR OF DESTRUCTION'S WINGS
THE TITAN'S BATTLE-CRY WAS IN MY EARS
ALARM AND RUMOUR SHOOK THE ARMOURED NIGHT
I SAW THE OMNIPOTENT'S FLAMING PIONEERS
OVER THE HEAVENLY VERGE WHICH TURNS TOWARDS LIFE
COME CROWDING DOWN THE AMBER STAIRS OF BIRTH
FORERUNNERS OF A DIVINE MULTITUDE
OUT OF THE PATHS OF THE MORNING STAR THEY CAME
INTO THE LITTLE ROOM OF MORTAL LIFE
I SAW THEM CROSS THE TWILIGHT OF AN AGE
THE SUN-EYED CHILDREN OF A MARVELLOUS DAWN
THE GREAT CREATORS WITH WIDE BROWS OF CALM
344
THE MASSIVE BARRIER-BREAKERS OF THE WORLD
AND WRESTLERS WITH DESTINY IN HER LISTS OF WILL
THE LABOURERS IN THE QUARRIES OF THE GODS
THE MESSENGERS OF THE INCOMMUNICABLE
THE ARCHITECTS OF IMMORTALITY
INTO THE FALLEN HUMAN SPHERE THEY CAME
FACES THAT WORE THE IMMORTAL'S GLORY STILL
VOICES THAT COMMUNED STILL WITH THE THOUGHTS OF GOD
BODIES MADE BEAUTIFUL BY THE SPIRIT'S LIGHT
CARRYING THE MAGIC WORD THE MYSTIC FIRE
CARRYING THE DIONYSIAN CUP OF JOY
APPROACHING EYES OF A DIVINER MAN
LIPS CHANTING AN UNKNOWN ANTHEM OF THE SOUL
FEET ECHOING IN THE CORRIDORS OF TIME
HIGH PRIESTS OF WISDOM SWEETNESS MIGHT AND BLISS
DISCOVERERS OF BEAUTY'S SUNLIT WAYS
AND SWIMMERS OF LOVE'S LAUGHING FIERY FLOODS
AND DANCERS WITHIN RAPTURE'S GOLDEN DOORS
THEIR TREAD ONE DAY SHALL CHANGE THE SUFFERING EARTH
AND JUSTIFY THE LIGHT ON NATURE'S FACE
ALTHOUGH FATE LINGERS IN THE HIGH BEYOND
AND THE WORK SEEMS VAIN ON WHICH OUR HEART'S FORCE WAS SPENT
ALL SHALL BE DONE FOR WHICH OUR PAIN WAS BORNE
EVEN AS OF OLD MAN CAME BEHIND THE BEAST
THIS HIGH DIVINE SUCCESSOR SURELY SHALL COME
BEHIND MAN'S INEFFICIENT MORTAL PACE
BEHIND HIS VAIN LABOUR SWEAT AND BLOOD AND TEARS
HE SHALL KNOW WHAT MORTAL MIND BARELY DURST THINK
HE SHALL DO WHAT THE HEART OF THE MORTAL COULD NOT DARE
INHERITOR OF THE TOIL OF HUMAN TIME
HE SHALL TAKE ON HIM THE BURDEN OF THE GODS
ALL HEAVENLY LIGHT SHALL VISIT THE EARTH'S THOUGHTS
THE MIGHT OF HEAVEN SHALL FORTIFY EARTHLY HEARTS
EARTH'S DEEDS SHALL TOUCH THE SUPERHUMAN'S HEIGHT
EARTH'S SEEING WIDEN INTO THE INFINITE
HEAVY UNCHANGED WEIGHS STILL THE IMPERFECT WORLD
345
THE SPLENDID YOUTH OF TIME HAS PASSED AND FAILED
HEAVY AND LONG ARE THE YEARS OUR LABOUR COUNTS
AND STILL THE SEALS ARE FIRM UPON MAN'S SOUL
AND WEARY IS THE ANCIENT MOTHER'S HEART
O TRUTH DEFENDED IN THY SECRET SUN
VOICE OF HER MIGHTY MUSINGS IN SHUT HEAVENS
ON THINGS WITHDRAWN WITHIN HER LUMINOUS DEPTHS
O WISDOM-SPLENDOUR MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE
CREATRIX THE ETERNAL'S ARTIST BRIDE
LINGER NOT LONG WITH THY TRANSMUTING HAND
PRESSED VAINLY ON ONE GOLDEN BAR OF TIME
AS IF TIME DARE NOT OPEN ITS HEART TO GOD
O RADIANT FOUNTAIN OF THE WORLD'S DELIGHT
WORLD-FREE AND UNATTAINABLE ABOVE
O BLISS WHO EVER DWELLST DEEP-HID WITHIN
WHILE MEN SEEK THEE OUTSIDE AND NEVER FIND
MYSTERY AND MUSE WITH HIERATIC TONGUE
INCARNATE THE WHITE PASSION OF THY FORCE
MISSION TO EARTH SOME LIVING FORM OF THEE
ONE MOMENT FILL WITH THY ETERNITY
LET THY INFINITY IN ONE BODY LIVE
ALL-KNOWLEDGE WRAP ONE MIND IN SEAS OF LIGHT
ALL-LOVE THROB SINGLE IN ONE HUMAN HEART
IMMORTAL TREADING THE EARTH WITH MORTAL FEET
ALL HEAVEN'S BEAUTY CROWD IN EARTHLY LIMBS
OMNIPOTENCE GIRDLE WITH THE POWER OF GOD
MOVEMENTS AND MOMENTS OF A MORTAL WILL
PACK WITH THE ETERNAL MIGHT ONE HUMAN HOUR
AND WITH ONE GESTURE CHANGE ALL FUTURE TIME
LET A GREAT WORD BE SPOKEN FROM THE HEIGHTS
AND ONE GREAT ACT UNLOCK THE DOORS OF FATE
HIS PRAYER SANK DOWN IN THE RESISTING NIGHT
OPPRESSED BY THE THOUSAND FORCES THAT DENY
AS IF TOO WEAK TO CLIMB TO THE SUPREME
BUT THERE AROSE A WIDE CONSENTING VOICE
346
THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WAS REVEALED IN SOUND
LIGHT FLOATED ROUND THE MARVELLOUS VISION'S BROW
AND ON HER LIPS THE IMMORTAL'S JOY TOOK SHAPE
O STRONG FORERUNNER I HAVE HEARD THY CRY
ONE SHALL DESCEND AND BREAK THE IRON LAW
CHANGE NATURE'S DOOM BY THE LONE SPIRIT'S POWER
A LIMITLESS MIND THAT CAN CONTAIN THE WORLD
A SWEET AND VIOLENT HEART OF ARDENT CALMS
MOVED BY THE PASSIONS OF THE GODS SHALL COME
ALL MIGHTS AND GREATNESSES SHALL JOIN IN HER
BEAUTY SHALL WALK CELESTIAL ON THE EARTH
DELIGHT SHALL SLEEP IN THE CLOUD-NET OF HER HAIR
AND IN HER BODY AS ON HIS HOMING TREE
IMMORTAL LOVE SHALL BEAT HIS GLORIOUS WINGS
A MUSIC OF GRIEFLESS THINGS SHALL WEAVE HER CHARM
THE HARPS OF THE PERFECT SHALL ATTUNE HER VOICE
THE STREAMS OF HEAVEN SHALL MURMUR IN HER LAUGH
HER LIPS SHALL BE THE HONEYCOMBS OF GOD
HER LIMBS HIS GOLDEN JARS OF ECSTASY
HER BREASTS THE RAPTURE-FLOWERS OF PARADISE
SHE SHALL BEAR WISDOM IN HER VOICELESS BOSOM
STRENGTH SHALL BE WITH HER LIKE A CONQUEROR'S SWORD
AND FROM HER EYES THE ETERNAL'S BLISS SHALL GAZE
A SEED SHALL BE SOWN IN DEATH'S TREMENDOUS HOUR
A BRANCH OF HEAVEN TRANSPLANT TO HUMAN SOIL
NATURE SHALL OVERLEAP HER MORTAL STEP
FATE SHALL BE CHANGED BY AN UNCHANGING WILL
AS A FLAME DISAPPEARS IN ENDLESS LIGHT
IMMORTALLY EXTINGUISHED IN ITS SOURCE
VANISHED THE SPLENDOUR AND WAS STILLED THE WORD
AN ECHO OF DELIGHT THAT ONCE WAS CLOSE
THE HARMONY JOURNEYED TOWARDS SOME DISTANT HUSH
A MUSIC FAILING IN THE EAR OF TRANCE
A CADENCE CALLED BY DISTANT CADENCES
A VOICE THAT TREMBLED INTO STRAINS WITHDRAWN
347
HER FORM RETREATED FROM THE LONGING EARTH
FORSAKING NEARNESS TO THE ABANDONED SENSE
ASCENDING TO HER UNATTAINABLE HOME
LONE BRILLIANT VACANT LAY THE INNER FIELDS
ALL WAS UNFILLED INORDINATE SPIRIT SPACE
INDIFFERENT WASTE A DESERT OF BRIGHT PEACE
THEN A LINE MOVED ON THE FAR EDGE OF CALM
THE WARM-LIPPED SENTIENT SOFT TERRESTRIAL WAVE
A QUICK AND MANY-MURMURED MOAN AND LAUGH
CAME GLIDING IN UPON WHITE FEET OF SOUND
UNLOCKED WAS THE DEEP GLORY OF SILENCE' HEART
THE ABSOLUTE UNMOVING STILLNESSES
SURRENDERED TO THE BREATH OF MORTAL AIR
DISSOLVING BOUNDLESSLY THE HEAVENS OF TRANCE
COLLAPSED TO WAKING MIND ETERNITY
CAST DOWN ITS INCOMMUNICABLE LIDS
OVER ITS SOLITUDES REMOTE FROM KEN
BEHIND THE VOICELESS MYSTERY OF SLEEP
THE GRANDIOSE RESPITE FAILED THE WIDE RELEASE
ACROSS THE LIGHT OF FAST-RECEDING PLANES
THAT FLED FROM HIM AS FROM A FALLING STAR
COMPELLED TO FILL ITS HUMAN HOUSE IN TIME
HIS SOUL DREW BACK INTO THE SPEED AND NOISE
OF THE VAST BUSINESS OF CREATED THINGS
A CHARIOT OF THE MARVELS OF THE HEAVENS
BROAD-BASED TO BEAR THE GODS ON FIERY WHEELS
FLAMING HE SWEPT THROUGH THE SPIRITUAL GATES
THE MORTAL STIR RECEIVED HIM IN ITS MIDST
ONCE MORE HE MOVED AMID MATERIAL SCENES
LIFTED BY INTIMATIONS FROM THE HEIGHTS
AND IN THE PAUSES OF THE BUILDING BRAIN
TOUCHED BY THE THOUGHTS THAT SKIM THE FATHOMLESS SURGE
OF NATURE AND WING BACK TO HIDDEN SHORES
THE ETERNAL SEEKER IN THE AEONIC FIELD
BESIEGED BY THE INTOLERANT PRESS OF HOURS
AGAIN WAS STRONG FOR GREAT SWIFT-FOOTED DEEDS
348
AWAKE BENEATH THE IGNORANT VAULT OF NIGHT
HE SAW THE UNNUMBERED PEOPLE OF THE STARS
AND HEARD THE QUESTIONING OF THE UNSATISFIED FLOOD
AND TOILED WITH THE FORM-MAKER MEASURING MIND
A WANDERER FROM THE OCCULT INVISIBLE SUNS
ACCOMPLISHING THE FATE OF TRANSIENT THINGS
A GOD IN THE FIGURE OF THE ARISEN BEAST
HE RAISED HIS BROW OF CONQUEST TO THE HEAVENS
ESTABLISHING THE EMPIRE OF THE SOUL
ON MATTER AND ITS BOUNDED UNIVERSE
AS ON A SOLID ROCK IN INFINITE SEAS
THE LORD OF LIFE RESUMED HIS MIGHTY ROUNDS
IN THE SCANT FIELD OF THE AMBIGUOUS GLOBE
349
A MAENAD OF THE CYCLES OF DESIRE
AROUND A LIGHT SHE MUST NOT DARE TO TOUCH
HASTENING TOWARDS A FAR-OFF UNKNOWN GOAL
EARTH FOLLOWED THE ENDLESS JOURNEY OF THE SUN
A MIND BUT HALF-AWAKE IN THE SWING OF THE VOID
ON THE BOSOM OF INCONSCIENCE DREAMED OUT LIFE
AND BORE THIS FINITE WORLD OF THOUGHT AND DEED
ACROSS THE IMMOBILE TRANCE OF THE INFINITE
A VAST IMMUTABLE SILENCE WITH HER RAN
PRISONER OF SPEED UPON A JEWELLED WHEEL
SHE COMMUNED WITH THE MYSTIC HEART IN SPACE
AMID THE AMBIGUOUS STILLNESS OF THE STARS
SHE MOVED TOWARDS SOME UNDISCLOSED EVENT
AND HER RHYTHM MEASURED THE LONG WHIRL OF TIME
IN CEASELESS MOTION ROUND THE PURPLE RIM
DAY AFTER DAY SPED BY LIKE COLOURED SPOKES
AND THROUGH A GLAMOUR OF SHIFTING HUES OF AIR
THE SEASONS DREW IN LINKED SIGNIFICANT DANCE
THE SYMBOL PAGEANT OF THE CHANGING YEAR
ACROSS THE BURNING LANGUOR OF THE SOIL
PACED SUMMER WITH HIS POMP OF VIOLENT NOONS
AND STAMPED HIS TYRANNY OF TORRID LIGHT
AND THE BLUE SEAL OF A GREAT BURNISHED SKY
NEXT THROUGH ITS FIERY SWOON OR CLOTTED KNOT
RAIN-TIDE BURST IN UPON TORN WINGS OF HEAT
STARTLED WITH LIGHTNINGS AIR'S UNQUIET DROWSE
LASHED WITH LIFE-GIVING STREAMS THE TORPID SOIL
OVERCAST WITH FLARE AND SOUND AND STORM-WINGED DARK
THE STAR-DEFENDED DOORS OF HEAVEN'S DIM SLEEP
OR FROM THE GOLD EYE OF HER PARAMOUR
COVERED WITH PACKED CLOUD-VEILS THE EARTH'S BROWN FACE
350
ARMIES OF REVOLUTION CROSSED THE TIME-FIELD
THE CLOUDS' UNENDING MARCH BESIEGED THE WORLD
TEMPESTS' PRONUNCIAMENTOS CLAIMED THE SKY
AND THUNDER DRUMS ANNOUNCED THE EMBATTLED GODS
A TRAVELLER FROM UNQUIET NEIGHBOURING SEAS
THE DENSE-MANED MONSOON RODE NEIGHING THROUGH EARTH'S HOURS
THICK NOW THE EMISSARY JAVELINS
ENORMOUS LIGHTNINGS SPLIT THE HORIZON'S RIM
AND HURLED FROM THE QUARTERS AS FROM CONTENDING CAMPS
MARRIED HEAVEN'S EDGES STEEP AND BARE AND BLIND
A SURGE AND HISS AND ONSET OF HUGE RAIN
THE LONG STRAIGHT SLEET-DRIFT CLAMOURS OF WINGED STORM-CHARGE
THRONGS OF WIND-FACES RUSHING OF WIND-FEET
HURRYING SWEPT THROUGH THE PRONE AFFLICTED PLAINS
HEAVEN'S WATERS TRAILED AND DRIBBLED THROUGH THE DROWNED LAND
THEN ALL WAS A SWIFT STRIDE A SIBILANT RACE
OR ALL WAS TEMPEST'S SHOUT AND WATER'S FALL
A DIMNESS SAGGED ON THE GREY FLOOR OF DAY
ITS DINGY SPRAWLING LENGTH JOINED MORN TO EVE
WALLOWING IN SLUDGE AND SHOWER IT REACHED BLACK DARK
DAY A HALF DARKNESS WORE AS ITS DULL DRESS
LIGHT LOOKED INTO DAWN'S TARNISHED GLASS AND MET
ITS OWN FACE THERE TWIN TO A HALF-LIT NIGHT'S
DOWNPOUR AND DRIP AND SEEPING MIST SWAYED ALL
AND TURNED DRY SOIL TO BOG AND REEKING MUD
EARTH WAS A QUAGMIRE HEAVEN A DISMAL BLOCK
NONE SAW THROUGH DANK DRENCHED WEEKS THE DUNGEON SUN
EVEN WHEN NO TURMOIL VEXED AIR'S SOMBRE REST
OR A FAINT RAY GLIMMERED THROUGH WEEPING CLOUDS
AS A SAD SMILE GLEAMS VEILED BY RETURNING TEARS
ALL PROMISED BRIGHTNESS FAILED AT ONCE DENIED
OR SOON CONDEMNED DIED LIKE A BRIEF-LIVED HOPE
THEN A LAST MASSIVE DELUGE THRASHED DEAD MIRE
AND A SUBSIDING MUTTER LEFT ALL STILL
OR ONLY THE MUDDY CREEP OF SINKING FLOODS
OR ONLY A WHISPER AND GREEN TOSS OF TREES
351
EARTH'S MOOD NOW CHANGED SHE LAY IN LULLED REPOSE
THE HOURS WENT BY WITH SLOW CONTENTED TREAD
A WIDE AND TRANQUIL AIR REMEMBERED PEACE
EARTH WAS THE COMRADE OF A HAPPY SUN
A CALMNESS NEARED AS OF THE APPROACH OF GOD
A LIGHT OF MUSING TRANCE LIT SOIL AND SKY
AND AN IDENTITY AND ECSTASY
FILLED MEDITATION'S SOLITARY HEART
A DREAM LOITERED IN THE DUMB MIND OF SPACE
TIME OPENED ITS CHAMBERS OF FELICITY
AN EXALTATION ENTERED AND A HOPE
AN INMOST SELF LOOKED UP TO A HEAVENLIER HEIGHT
AN INMOST THOUGHT KINDLED A HIDDEN FLAME
AND THE INNER SIGHT ADORED AN UNSEEN SUN
THREE THOUGHTFUL SEASONS PASSED WITH SHINING TREAD
AND SCANNING ONE BY ONE THE PREGNANT HOURS
WATCHED FOR A FLAME THAT LURKED IN LUMINOUS DEPTHS
THE VIGIL OF SOME MIGHTY BIRTH TO COME
AUTUMN LED IN THE GLORY OF HER MOONS
AND DREAMED IN THE SPLENDOUR OF HER LOTUS POOLS
AND WINTER AND DEW-TIME LAID THEIR CALM COOL HANDS
ON NATURE'S BOSOM STILL IN A HALF SLEEP
AND DEEPENED WITH HUES OF LAX AND MELLOW EASE
THE TRANQUIL BEAUTY OF THE WANING YEAR
THEN SPRING AN ARDENT LOVER LEAPED THROUGH LEAVES
AND CAUGHT THE EARTH-BRIDE IN HIS EAGER CLASP
HIS ADVENT WAS A FIRE OF IRISED HUES
HIS ARMS WERE A CIRCLE OF THE ARRIVAL OF JOY
HIS VOICE WAS A CALL TO THE TRANSCENDENT'S SPHERE
WHOSE SECRET TOUCH UPON OUR MORTAL LIVES
KEEPS EVER NEW THE THRILL THAT MADE THE WORLD
REMOULDS AN ANCIENT SWEETNESS TO NEW SHAPES
AND GUARDS INTACT UNCHANGED BY DEATH AND TIME
THE ANSWER OF OUR HEARTS TO NATURE'S CHARM
AND KEEPS FOR EVER NEW YET STILL THE SAME
THE THROB THAT EVER WAKES TO THE OLD DELIGHT
352
AND BEAUTY AND RAPTURE AND THE JOY TO LIVE
HIS COMING BROUGHT THE MAGIC AND THE SPELL
AT HIS TOUCH LIFE'S TIRED HEART GREW GLAD AND YOUNG
HE MADE JOY A WILLING PRISONER IN HER BREAST
HIS GRASP WAS A YOUNG GOD'S UPON EARTH'S LIMBS
CHANGED BY THE PASSION OF HIS DIVINE OUTBREAK
HE MADE HER BODY BEAUTIFUL WITH HIS KISS
IMPATIENT FOR FELICITY HE CAME
HIGH-FLUTING WITH THE COIL'S HAPPY VOICE
HIS PEACOCK TURBAN TRAILING ON THE TREES
HIS BREATH WAS A WARM SUMMONS TO DELIGHT
THE DENSE VOLUPTUOUS AZURE WAS HIS GAZE
A SOFT CELESTIAL URGE SURPRISED THE BLOOD
RICH WITH THE INSTINCT OF GOD'S SENSUOUS JOYS
REVEALED IN BEAUTY A CADENCE WAS ABROAD
INSISTENT ON THE RAPTURE-THRILL IN LIFE
IMMORTAL MOVEMENTS TOUCHED THE FLEETING HOURS
A GODLIKE PACKED INTENSITY OF SENSE
MADE IT A PASSIONATE PLEASURE EVEN TO BREATHE
ALL SIGHTS AND VOICES WOVE A SINGLE CHARM
THE LIFE OF THE ENCHANTED GLOBE BECAME
A STORM OF SWEETNESS AND OF LIGHT AND SONG
A REVEL OF COLOUR AND OF ECSTASY
A HYMN OF RAYS A LITANY OF CRIES
A STRAIN OF CHORAL PRIESTLY MUSIC SANG
AND SWUNG ON THE SWAYING CENSER OF THE TREES
A SACRIFICE OF PERFUME FILLED THE HOURS
ASOCAS BURNED IN CRIMSON SPOTS OF FLAME
PURE LIKE THE BREATH OF AN UNSTAINED DESIRE
WHITE JASMINES HAUNTED THE ENAMOURED AIR
PALE MANGO-BLOSSOMS FED THE LIQUID VOICE
OF THE LOVE-MADDENED COIL AND THE BROWN BEE
MUTTERED IN FRAGRANCE MID THE HONEY-BUDS
THE SUNLIGHT WAS A GREAT GOD'S GOLDEN SMILE
ALL NATURE WAS AT BEAUTY'S FESTIVAL
353
IN THIS HIGH SIGNAL MOMENT OF THE GODS
ANSWERING EARTH'S YEARNING AND HER CRY FOR BLISS
A GREATNESS FROM OUR OTHER COUNTRIES CAME
A SILENCE IN THE NOISE OF EARTHLY THINGS
IMMUTABLY REVEALED THE SECRET WORD
A MIGHTIER INFLUX FILLED THE OBLIVIOUS CLAY
A LAMP WAS LIT A SACRED IMAGE MADE
A MEDIATING RAY HAD TOUCHED THE EARTH
BRIDGING THE GULF BETWEEN MAN'S MIND AND GOD'S
ITS BRIGHTNESS LINKED OUR TRANSIENCE TO THE UNKNOWN
A SPIRIT OF ITS CELESTIAL SOURCE AWARE
TRANSLATING HEAVEN INTO A HUMAN SHAPE
DESCENDED INTO EARTH'S IMPERFECT MOULD
AND WEPT NOT FALLEN TO MORTALITY
BUT LOOKED ON ALL WITH LARGE AND TRANQUIL EYES
ONE HAD RETURNED FROM THE TRANSCENDENT PLANES
AND BORE ANEW THE LOAD OF MORTAL BREATH
WHO HAD STRIVEN OF OLD WITH OUR DARKNESS AND OUR PAIN
SHE TOOK AGAIN HER DIVINE UNFINISHED TASK
SURVIVOR OF DEATH AND THE AEONIC YEARS
ONCE MORE WITH HER FATHOMLESS HEART SHE FRONTED TIME
AGAIN THERE WAS RENEWED AGAIN REVEALED
THE ANCIENT CLOSENESS BY EARTH-VISION VEILED
THE SECRET CONTACT BROKEN OFF IN TIME
A CONSANGUINITY OF EARTH AND HEAVEN
BETWEEN THE HUMAN PORTION TOILING HERE
AND AN AS YET UNBORN AND LIMITLESS FORCE
AGAIN THE MYSTIC DEEP ATTEMPT BEGAN
THE DARING WAGER OF THE COSMIC GAME
FOR SINCE UPON THIS BLIND AND WHIRLING GLOBE
EARTH-PLASM FIRST QUIVERED WITH THE ILLUMINING MIND
AND LIFE INVADED THE MATERIAL SHEATH
AFFLICTING INCONSCIENCE WITH THE NEED TO FEEL
SINCE IN INFINITY'S SILENCE WOKE A WORD
A MOTHER-WISDOM WORKS IN NATURE'S BREAST
TO POUR DELIGHT ON THE HEART OF TOIL AND WANT
354
AND PRESS PERFECTION ON LIFE'S STUMBLING POWERS
IMPOSE HEAVEN-SENTIENCE ON THE OBSCURE ABYSS
AND MAKE DUMB MATTER CONSCIOUS OF ITS GOD
ALTHOUGH OUR FALLEN MINDS FORGET TO CLIMB
ALTHOUGH OUR HUMAN STUFF RESISTS OR BREAKS
SHE KEEPS HER WILL THAT HOPES TO DIVINISE CLAY
FAILURE CANNOT REPRESS DEFEAT O'ERTHROW
TIME CANNOT WEARY HER NOR THE VOID SUBDUE
THE AGES HAVE NOT MADE HER PASSION LESS
NO VICTORY SHE ADMITS OF DEATH OR FATE
ALWAYS SHE DRIVES THE SOUL TO NEW ATTEMPT
ALWAYS HER MAGICAL INFINITUDE
FORCES TO ASPIRE THE INERT BRUTE ELEMENTS
AS ONE WHO HAS ALL INFINITY TO WASTE
SHE SCATTERS THE SEED OF THE ETERNAL'S STRENGTH
ON A HALF-ANIMATE AND CRUMBLING MOULD
PLANTS HEAVEN'S DELIGHT IN THE HEART'S PASSIONATE MIRE
POURS GODHEAD'S SEEKINGS INTO A BARE BEAST FRAME
HIDES IMMORTALITY IN A MASK OF DEATH
ONCE MORE THAT WILL PUT ON AN EARTHLY SHAPE
A MIND EMPOWERED FROM TRUTH'S IMMUTABLE SEAT
WAS FRAMED FOR VISION AND INTERPRETING ACT
AND INSTRUMENTS WERE SOVEREIGNLY DESIGNED
TO EXPRESS DIVINITY IN TERRESTRIAL SIGNS
OUTLINED BY THE PRESSURE OF THIS NEW DESCENT
A LOVELIER BODY FORMED THAN EARTH HAD KNOWN
AS YET A PROPHECY ONLY AND A HINT
THE GLOWING ARC OF A CHARMED UNSEEN WHOLE
IT CAME INTO THE SKY OF MORTAL LIFE
BRIGHT LIKE THE CRESCENT HORN OF A GOLD MOON
RETURNING IN A FAINT ILLUMINED EVE
AT FIRST GLIMMERING LIKE AN UNSHAPED IDEA
PASSIVE SHE LAY SHELTERED IN WORDLESS SLEEP
INVOLVED AND DROWNED IN MATTER'S GIANT TRANCE
AN INFANT HEART OF THE DEEP-CAVED WORLD-PLAN
IN CRADLE OF DIVINE INCONSCIENCE ROCKED
355
BY THE UNIVERSAL ECSTASY OF THE SUNS
SOME MISSIONED POWER IN THE HALF-WAKENED FRAME
NURSED A TRANSCENDENT BIRTH'S DUMB GLORIOUS SEED
FOR WHICH THIS VIVID TENEMENT WAS MADE
BUT SOON THE LINK OF SOUL WITH FORM GREW SURE
FLOODED WAS THE DIM CAVE WITH SLOW CONSCIENT LIGHT
THE SEED GREW INTO A DELICATE MARVELLOUS BUD
THE BUD DISCLOSED A GREAT AND HEAVENLY BLOOM
AT ONCE SHE SEEMED TO FOUND A MIGHTIER RACE
ARRIVED UPON THE STRANGE AND DUBIOUS GLOBE
THE CHILD REMEMBERING INLY A FAR HOME
LIVED GUARDED IN HER SPIRIT'S LUMINOUS CELL
ALONE MID MEN IN HER DIVINER KIND
EVEN IN HER CHILDISH MOVEMENTS COULD BE FELT
THE NEARNESS OF A LIGHT STILL KEPT FROM EARTH
FEELINGS THAT ONLY ETERNITY COULD SHARE
THOUGHTS NATURAL AND NATIVE TO THE GODS
AS NEEDING NOTHING BUT ITS OWN RAPT FLIGHT
HER NATURE DWELT IN A STRONG SEPARATE AIR
LIKE A STRANGE BIRD WITH LARGE RICH-COLOURED BREAST
THAT SOJOURNS ON A SECRET FRUITED BOUGH
LOST IN THE EMERALD GLORY OF THE WOODS
OR FLIES ABOVE DIVINE UNREACHABLE TOPS
HARMONIOUSLY SHE IMPRESSED THE EARTH WITH HEAVEN
ALIGNED TO A SWIFT RHYTHM OF SHEER DELIGHT
AND SINGING TO THEMSELVES HER DAYS WENT BY
EACH MINUTE WAS A THROB OF BEAUTY'S HEART
THE HOURS WERE TUNED TO A SWEET-TONED CONTENT
WHICH ASKED FOR NOTHING BUT TOOK ALL LIFE GAVE
SOVEREIGNLY AS HER NATURE'S INBORN RIGHT
NEAR WAS HER SPIRIT TO ITS PARENT SUN
THE BREATH WITHIN TO THE ETERNAL JOY
THE FIRST FAIR LIFE THAT BREAKS FROM NATURE'S SWOON
MOUNTS IN A LINE OF RAPTURE TO THE SKIES
ABSORBED IN ITS OWN HAPPY URGE IT LIVES
SUFFICIENT TO ITSELF YET TURNED TO ALL
356
IT HAS NO SEEN COMMUNION WITH ITS WORLD
NO OPEN CONVERSE WITH SURROUNDING THINGS
THERE IS A ONENESS NATIVE AND OCCULT
THAT NEEDS NO INSTRUMENTS AND ERECTS NO FORM
IN UNISON IT GROWS WITH ALL THAT IS
ALL CONTACTS IT ASSUMES INTO ITS TRANCE
LAUGH-TOSSED CONSENTS TO THE WIND'S KISS AND TAKES
TRANSMUTINGLY THE SHOCKS OF SUN AND BREEZE
A BLISSFUL YEARNING RIOTS IN ITS LEAVES
A MAGIC PASSION TREMBLES IN ITS BLOOMS
ITS BOUGHS ASPIRE IN HUSHED FELICITY
AN OCCULT GODHEAD OF THIS BEAUTY IS CAUSE
THE SPIRIT AND INTIMATE GUEST OF ALL THIS CHARM
THIS SWEETNESS'S PRIESTESS AND THIS REVERIE'S MUSE
INVISIBLY PROTECTED FROM OUR SENSE
THE DRYAD LIVES DRENCHED IN A DEEPER RAY
AND FEELS ANOTHER AIR OF STORMS AND CALMS
AND QUIVERS INWARDLY WITH MYSTIC RAIN
THIS AT A HEAVENLIER HEIGHT WAS SHOWN IN HER
EVEN WHEN SHE BENT TO MEET EARTH'S INTIMACIES
HER SPIRIT KEPT THE STATURE OF THE GODS
IT STOOPED BUT WAS NOT LOST IN MATTER'S REIGN
A WORLD TRANSLATED WAS HER GLEAMING MIND
AND MARVEL-MOONED BRIGHT CROWDING FANTASIES
FED WITH SPIRITUAL SUSTENANCE OF DREAMS
THE IDEAL GODDESS IN HER HOUSE OF GOLD
AWARE OF FORMS TO WHICH OUR EYES ARE CLOSED
CONSCIOUS OF NEARNESSES WE CANNOT FEEL
THE POWER WITHIN HER SHAPED HER MOULDING SENSE
IN DEEPER FIGURES THAN OUR SURFACE TYPES
AN INVISIBLE SUNLIGHT RAN WITHIN HER VEINS
AND FLOODED HER BRAIN WITH HEAVENLY BRILLIANCES
THAT WOKE A WIDER SIGHT THAN EARTH COULD KNOW
OUTLINED IN THE SINCERITY OF THAT RAY
HER SPRINGING CHILDLIKE THOUGHTS WERE RICHLY TURNED
INTO LUMINOUS PATTERNS OF HER SOUL'S DEEP TRUTH
357
AND FROM HER EYES SHE CAST ANOTHER LOOK
ON ALL AROUND HER THAN MAN'S IGNORANT VIEW
ALL OBJECTS WERE TO HER SHAPES OF LIVING SELVES
AND SHE PERCEIVED A MESSAGE FROM HER KIN
IN EACH AWAKENING TOUCH OF OUTWARD THINGS
EACH WAS A SYMBOL POWER A VIVID FLASH
IN THE CIRCUIT OF INFINITIES HALF-KNOWN
NOTHING WAS ALIEN OR INANIMATE
NOTHING WITHOUT ITS MEANING OR ITS CALL
FOR WITH A GREATER NATURE SHE WAS ONE
AS FROM THE SOIL SPRANG GLORY OF BRANCH AND FLOWER
AS FROM THE ANIMAL'S LIFE ROSE THINKING MAN
A NEW EPIPHANY APPEARED IN HER
A MIND OF LIGHT A LIFE OF RHYTHMIC FORCE
A BODY INSTINCT WITH HIDDEN DIVINITY
PREPARED AN IMAGE OF THE COMING GOD
AND WHEN THE SLOW RHYME OF THE EXPANDING YEARS
AND THE RICH MURMUROUS SWARM-WORK OF THE DAYS
HAD HONEY-PACKED HER SENSE AND FILLED HER LIMBS
ACCOMPLISHING THE MOON-ORB OF HER GRACE
SELF-GUARDED IN THE SILENCE OF HER STRENGTH
HER SOLITARY GREATNESS WAS NOT LESS
NEARER THE GODHEAD TO THE SURFACE PRESSED
A SUN REPLACING CHILDHOOD'S NEBULA
SOVEREIGN IN A BLUE AND LONELY SKY
UPWARD IT ROSE TO GRASP THE HUMAN SCENE
THE STRONG INHABITANT TURNED TO WATCH HER FIELD
A LOVELIER LIGHT ASSUMED HER SPIRIT BROW
AND SWEET AND SOLEMN GREW HER MUSING GAZE
CELESTIAL-HUMAN DEEP WARM SLUMBROUS FIRES
WOKE IN THE LONG FRINGED GLORY OF HER EYES
LIKE ALTAR-BURNINGS IN A MYSTERIED SHRINE
OUT OF THOSE CRYSTAL WINDOWS GLEAMED A WILL
THAT BROUGHT A LARGE SIGNIFICANCE TO LIFE
HOLDING HER FOREHEAD'S CANDID STAINLESS SPACE
BEHIND THE STUDENT ARCH A NOBLE POWER
358
OF WISDOM LOOKED FROM LIGHT ON TRANSIENT THINGS
A SCOUT OF VICTORY IN A VIGIL TOWER
HER ASPIRATION CALLED HIGH DESTINY DOWN
A SILENT WARRIOR PACED IN HER CITY OF STRENGTH
INVIOLATE GUARDING TRUTH'S DIAMOND THRONE
A NECTAROUS HALOED MOON HER PASSIONATE HEART
LOVED ALL AND SPOKE NO WORD AND MADE NO SIGN
BUT KEPT HER BOSOM'S RAPTUROUS SECRECY
A BLISSFUL ARDENT MOVED AND VOICELESS WORLD
PROUD SWIFT AND JOYFUL RAN THE WAVE OF LIFE
WITHIN HER LIKE A STREAM IN PARADISE
MANY HIGH GODS DWELT IN ONE BEAUTIFUL HOME
YET WAS HER NATURE'S ORB A PERFECT WHOLE
HARMONIOUS LIKE A CHANT WITH MANY TONES
IMMENSE AND VARIOUS LIKE A UNIVERSE
THE BODY THAT HELD THIS GREATNESS SEEMED ALMOST
AN IMAGE MADE OF HEAVEN'S TRANSPARENT LIGHT
ITS CHARM RECALLED THINGS SEEN IN VISION'S HOURS
A GOLDEN BRIDGE SPANNING A FAERY FLOOD
A MOON-TOUCHED PALM-TREE SINGLE BY A LAKE
COMPANION OF THE WIDE AND GLIMMERING PEACE
A MURMUR AS OF LEAVES IN PARADISE
MOVING WHEN FEET OF THE IMMORTALS PASS
A FIERY HALO OVER SLEEPING HILLS
A STRANGE AND STARRY HEAD ALONE IN NIGHT
359
A LAND OF MOUNTAINS AND WIDE SUN-BEAT PLAINS
AND GIANT RIVERS PACING TO VAST SEAS
A FIELD OF CREATION AND SPIRITUAL HUSH
SILENCE SWALLOWING LIFE'S ACTS INTO THE DEEPS
OF THOUGHT'S TRANSCENDENT CLIMB AND HEAVENWARD LEAP
A BROODING WORLD OF REVERIE AND TRANCE
FILLED WITH THE MIGHTIEST WORKS OF GOD AND MAN
WHERE NATURE SEEMED A DREAM OF THE DIVINE
AND BEAUTY AND GRACE AND GRANDEUR HAD THEIR HOME
HARBOURED THE CHILDHOOD OF THE INCARNATE FLAME
OVER HER WATCHED MILLENNIAL INFLUENCES
AND THE DEEP GODHEADS OF A GRANDIOSE PAST
LOOKED ON HER AND SAW THE FUTURE'S GODHEADS COME
AS IF THIS MAGNET DREW THEIR POWERS UNSEEN
EARTH'S BROODING WISDOM SPOKE TO HER STILL BREAST
MOUNTING FROM MIND'S LAST PEAKS TO MATE WITH GODS
MAKING EARTH'S BRILLIANT THOUGHTS A SPRINGING-BOARD
TO DIVE INTO THE COSMIC VASTNESSES
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE THINKER AND THE SEER
SAW THE UNSEEN AND THOUGHT THE UNTHINKABLE
OPENED THE ENORMOUS DOORS OF THE UNKNOWN
RENT MAN'S HORIZONS INTO INFINITY
A SHORELESS SWEEP WAS LENT TO THE MORTAL'S ACTS
AND ART AND BEAUTY SPRANG FROM THE HUMAN DEPTHS
NATURE AND SOUL VIED IN NOBILITY
ETHICS THE HUMAN KEYED TO IMITATE HEAVEN
THE HARMONY OF A RICH CULTURE'S TONES
REFINED THE SENSE AND MAGNIFIED ITS REACH
TO HEAR THE UNHEARD AND GLIMPSE THE INVISIBLE
AND TAUGHT THE SOUL TO SOAR BEYOND THINGS KNOWN
INSPIRING LIFE TO GREATEN AND BREAK ITS BOUNDS
360
ASPIRING TO THE IMMORTALS' UNSEEN WORLD
LEAVING EARTH'S SAFETY DARING WINGS OF MIND
BORE HER ABOVE THE TRODDEN FIELDS OF THOUGHT
CROSSING THE MYSTIC SEAS OF THE BEYOND
TO LIVE ON EAGLE HEIGHTS NEAR TO THE SUN
THERE WISDOM SITS ON HER ETERNAL THRONE
ALL HER LIFE'S TURNS LED HER TO SYMBOL DOORS
ADMITTING TO SECRET POWERS THAT WERE HER KIN
ADEPT OF TRUTH INITIATE OF BLISS
A MYSTIC ACOLYTE TRAINED IN NATURE'S SCHOOL
AWARE OF THE MARVEL OF CREATED THINGS
SHE LAID THE SECRECIES OF HER HEART'S DEEP MUSE
UPON THE ALTAR OF THE WONDERFUL
HER HOURS WERE A RITUAL IN A TIMELESS FANE
HER ACTS BECAME GESTURES OF SACRIFICE
INVESTED WITH A RHYTHM OF HIGHER SPHERES
THE WORD WAS USED AS A HIERATIC MEANS
FOR THE RELEASE OF THE IMPRISONED SPIRIT
INTO COMMUNION WITH ITS COMRADE GODS
OR IT HELPED TO BEAT OUT NEW EXPRESSIVE FORMS
OF THAT WHICH LABOURS IN THE HEART OF LIFE
SOME IMMEMORIAL SOUL IN MEN AND THINGS
SEEKER OF THE UNKNOWN AND THE UNBORN
CARRYING A LIGHT FROM THE INEFFABLE
TO REND THE VEIL OF THE LAST MYSTERIES
INTENSE PHILOSOPHIES POINTED EARTH TO HEAVEN
OR ON FOUNDATIONS BROAD AS COSMIC SPACE
UPRAISED THE EARTH-MIND TO SUPERHUMAN HEIGHTS
OVERPASSING LINES THAT PLEASE THE OUTWARD EYES
BUT HIDE THE SIGHT OF THAT WHICH LIVES WITHIN
SCULPTURE AND PAINTING CONCENTRATED SENSE
UPON AN INNER VISION'S MOTIONLESS VERGE
REVEALED A FIGURE OF THE INVISIBLE
UNVEILED ALL NATURE'S MEANING IN A FORM
OR CAUGHT INTO A BODY THE DIVINE
THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE INFINITE
361
DISCOVERED HERE ITS INWARD-MUSING SHAPES
CAPTURED INTO WIDE BREADTHS OF SOARING STONE
MUSIC BROUGHT DOWN CELESTIAL YEARNINGS SONG
HELD THE MERGED HEART ABSORBED IN RAPTUROUS DEPTHS
LINKING THE HUMAN WITH THE COSMIC CRY
THE WORLD-INTERPRETING MOVEMENTS OF THE DANCE
MOULDED IDEA AND MOOD TO A RHYTHMIC SWAY
AND POSTURE CRAFTS MINUTE IN SUBTLE LINES
ETERNISED A SWIFT MOMENT'S MEMORY
OR SHOWED IN A CARVING'S SWEEP A CUP'S DESIGN
THE UNDERLYING PATTERNS OF THE UNSEEN
POEMS IN LARGENESS CAST LIKE MOVING WORLDS
AND METRES SURGING WITH THE OCEAN'S VOICE
TRANSLATED BY GRANDEURS LOCKED IN NATURE'S HEART
BUT THROWN NOW INTO A CROWDED GLORY OF SPEECH
THE BEAUTY AND SUBLIMITY OF HER FORMS
THE PASSION OF HER MOMENTS AND HER MOODS
LIFTING THE HUMAN WORD NEARER TO THE GOD'S
MAN'S EYES COULD LOOK INTO THE INNER REALMS
HIS SCRUTINY DISCOVERED NUMBER'S LAW
AND ORGANISED THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS
MAPPED OUT THE VISIBLE FASHIONING OF THE WORLD
QUESTIONED THE PROCESS OF HIS THOUGHTS OR MADE
A THEORISED DIAGRAM OF MIND AND LIFE
THESE THINGS SHE TOOK IN AS HER NATURE'S FOOD
BUT THESE ALONE COULD FILL NOT HER WIDE SELF
A HUMAN SEEKING LIMITED BY ITS GAINS
TO HER THEY SEEMED THE GREAT AND EARLY STEPS
HAZARDOUS OF A YOUNG DISCOVERING SPIRIT
WHICH SAW NOT YET BY ITS OWN NATIVE LIGHT
IT TAPPED THE UNIVERSE WITH TESTING KNOCKS
OR STRETCHED TO FIND TRUTH MIND'S DIVINING ROD
THERE WAS A GROWING OUT TO NUMBERLESS SIDES
BUT NOT THE WIDEST SEEING OF THE SOUL
NOT YET THE VAST DIRECT IMMEDIATE TOUCH
NOR YET THE ART AND WISDOM OF THE GODS
362
A BOUNDLESS KNOWLEDGE GREATER THAN MAN'S THOUGHT
A HAPPINESS TOO HIGH FOR HEART AND SENSE
LOCKED IN THE WORLD AND YEARNING FOR RELEASE
SHE FELT IN HER WAITING AS YET FOR FORM
IT ASKED FOR OBJECTS AROUND WHICH TO GROW
AND NATURES STRONG TO BEAR WITHOUT RECOIL
THE SPLENDOUR OF HER NATIVE ROYALTY
HER GREATNESS AND HER SWEETNESS AND HER BLISS
HER MIGHT TO POSSESS AND HER VAST POWER TO LOVE
EARTH MADE A STEPPING-STONE TO CONQUER HEAVEN
THE SOUL SAW BEYOND HEAVEN'S LIMITING BOUNDARIES
MET A GREAT LIGHT FROM THE UNKNOWABLE
AND DREAMED OF A TRANSCENDENT ACTION'S SPHERE
AWARE OF THE UNIVERSAL SELF IN ALL
SHE TURNED TO LIVING HEARTS AND HUMAN FORMS
HER SOUL'S REFLECTIONS COMPLEMENTS COUNTERPARTS
THE CLOSE OUTLYING PORTIONS OF HER BEING
DIVIDED FROM HER BY WALLS OF BODY AND MIND
YET TO HER SPIRIT BOUND BY TIES DIVINE
OVERCOMING INVISIBLE HEDGE AND MASKED DEFENCE
AND THE LONELINESS THAT SEPARATES SOUL FROM SOUL
SHE WISHED TO MAKE ALL ONE IMMENSE EMBRACE
THAT SHE MIGHT HOUSE IN IT ALL LIVING THINGS
RAISED INTO A SPLENDID POINT OF SEEING LIGHT
OUT OF DIVISION'S DENSE INCONSCIENT CLEFT
AND MAKE THEM ONE WITH GOD AND WORLD AND HER
ONLY A FEW RESPONDED TO HER CALL
STILL FEWER FELT THE SCREENED DIVINITY
AND STROVE TO MATE ITS GODHEAD WITH THEIR OWN
APPROACHING WITH SOME KINSHIP TO HER HEIGHTS
UPLIFTED TOWARDS LUMINOUS SECRECIES
OR CONSCIOUS OF SOME SPLENDOUR HIDDEN ABOVE
THEY LEAPED TO FIND HER IN A MOMENT'S FLASH
GLIMPSING A LIGHT IN A CELESTIAL VAST
BUT COULD NOT KEEP THE VISION AND THE POWER
AND FELL BACK TO LIFE'S DULL ORDINARY TONE
363
A MIND DARING HEAVENLY EXPERIMENT
GROWING TOWARDS SOME LARGENESS THEY FELT NEAR
TESTING THE UNKNOWN'S BOUND WITH EAGER TOUCH
THEY STILL WERE PRISONED BY THEIR HUMAN GRAIN
THEY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH HER TIRELESS STEP
TOO SMALL AND EAGER FOR HER LARGE-PACED WILL
TOO NARROW TO LOOK WITH THE UNBORN INFINITE'S GAZE
THEIR NATURE WEARY GREW OF THINGS TOO GREAT
FOR EVEN THE CLOSE PARTNERS OF HER THOUGHTS
WHO COULD HAVE WALKED THE NEAREST TO HER RAY
WORSHIPPED THE POWER AND LIGHT THEY FELT IN HER
BUT COULD NOT MATCH THE MEASURE OF HER SOUL
A FRIEND AND YET TOO GREAT WHOLLY TO KNOW
SHE WALKED IN THEIR FRONT TOWARDS A GREATER LIGHT
THEIR LEADER AND QUEEN OVER THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS
ONE CLOSE TO THEIR BOSOMS YET DIVINE AND FAR
ADMIRING AND AMAZED THEY SAW HER STRIDE
ATTEMPTING WITH A GODLIKE RUSH AND LEAP
HEIGHTS FOR THEIR HUMAN STATURE TOO REMOTE
OR WITH A SLOW GREAT MANY-SIDED TOIL
PUSHING TOWARDS AIMS THEY HARDLY COULD CONCEIVE
YET FORCED TO BE THE SATELLITES OF HER SUN
THEY MOVED UNABLE TO FOREGO HER LIGHT
DESIRING THEY CLUTCHED AT HER WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS
OR FOLLOWED STUMBLING IN THE PATHS SHE MADE
OR LONGING WITH THEIR SELF OF LIFE AND FLESH
THEY CLUNG TO HER FOR HEART'S NOURISHMENT AND SUPPORT
THE REST THEY COULD NOT SEE IN VISIBLE LIGHT
VAGUELY THEY BORE HER INNER MIGHTINESS
OR BOUND BY THE SENSES AND THE LONGING HEART
ADORING WITH A TURBID HUMAN LOVE
THEY COULD NOT GRASP THE MIGHTY SPIRIT SHE WAS
OR CHANGE BY CLOSENESS TO BE EVEN AS SHE
SOME FELT HER WITH THEIR SOULS AND THRILLED WITH HER
A GREATNESS FELT NEAR YET BEYOND MIND'S GRASP
TO SEE HER WAS A SUMMONS TO ADORE
364
TO BE NEAR HER DREW A HIGH COMMUNION'S FORCE
SO MEN WORSHIP A GOD TOO GREAT TO KNOW
TOO HIGH TOO VAST TO WEAR A LIMITING SHAPE
THEY FEEL A PRESENCE AND OBEY A MIGHT
ADORE A LOVE WHOSE RAPTURE INVADES THEIR BREASTS
TO A DIVINE ARDOUR QUICKENING THE HEART-BEATS
A LAW THEY FOLLOW GREATENING HEART AND LIFE
OPENED TO THE BREATH IS A NEW DIVINER AIR
OPENED TO MAN IS A FREER HAPPIER WORLD
HE SEES HIGH STEPS CLIMBING TO SELF AND LIGHT
HER DIVINE PARTS THE SOUL'S ALLEGIANCE CALLED
IT SAW IT FELT IT KNEW THE DEITY
HER WILL WAS PUISSANT ON THEIR NATURE'S ACTS
HER HEART'S INEXHAUSTIBLE SWEETNESS LURED THEIR HEARTS
A BEING THEY LOVED WHOSE BOUNDS EXCEEDED THEIRS
HER MEASURE THEY COULD NOT REACH BUT BORE HER TOUCH
ANSWERING WITH THE FLOWER'S ANSWER TO THE SUN
THEY GAVE THEMSELVES TO HER AND ASKED NO MORE
ONE GREATER THAN THEMSELVES TOO WIDE FOR THEIR KEN
THEIR MINDS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND NOR WHOLLY KNOW
THEIR LIVES REPLIED TO HERS MOVED AT HER WORDS
THEY FELT A GODHEAD AND OBEYED A CALL
ANSWERED TO HER LEAD AND DID HER WORK IN THE WORLD
THEIR LIVES THEIR NATURES MOVED COMPELLED BY HERS
AS IF THE TRUTH OF THEIR OWN LARGER SELVES
PUT ON AN ASPECT OF DIVINITY
TO EXALT THEM TO A PITCH BEYOND THEIR EARTH'S
THEY FELT A LARGER FUTURE MEET THEIR WALK
SHE HELD THEIR HANDS SHE CHOSE FOR THEM THEIR PATHS
THEY WERE MOVED BY HER TOWARDS GREAT UNKNOWN THINGS
FAITH DREW THEM AND THE JOY TO FEEL THEMSELVES HERS
THEY LIVED IN HER THEY SAW THE WORLD WITH HER EYES
SOME TURNED TO HER AGAINST THEIR NATURE'S BENT
DIVIDED BETWEEN WONDER AND REVOLT
DRAWN BY HER CHARM AND MASTERED BY HER WILL
POSSESSED BY HER HER STRIVING TO POSSESS
365
IMPATIENT SUBJECTS THEIR TIED LONGING HEARTS
HUGGING THE BONDS CLOSE OF WHICH THEY MOST COMPLAINED
MURMURED AT A YOKE THEY WOULD HAVE WEPT TO LOSE
THE SPLENDID YOKE OF HER BEAUTY AND HER LOVE
OTHERS PURSUED HER WITH LIFE'S BLIND DESIRES
AND CLAIMING ALL OF HER AS THEIR LONELY OWN
HASTENED TO ENGROSS HER SWEETNESS MEANT FOR ALL
AS EARTH CLAIMS LIGHT FOR ITS LONE SEPARATE NEED
DEMANDING HER FOR THEIR SOLE JEALOUS CLASP
THEY ASKED FROM HER MOVEMENTS BOUNDED LIKE THEIR OWN
AND TO THEIR SMALLNESS CRAVED A LIKE RESPONSE
OR THEY REPINED THAT SHE SURPASSED THEIR GRIP
AND HOPED TO BIND HER CLOSE WITH LONGING'S CORDS
OR FINDING HER TOUCH DESIRED TOO STRONG TO BEAR
THEY BLAMED HER FOR A TYRANNY THEY LOVED
SHRANK INTO THEMSELVES AS FROM TOO BRIGHT A SUN
YET HANKERED FOR THE SPLENDOUR THEY REFUSED
ANGRILY ENAMOURED OF HER SWEET PASSIONATE RAY
THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR EARTH COULD HARDLY BEAR
THEY LONGED BUT CRIED OUT AT THE TOUCH DESIRED
INAPT TO MEET DIVINITY SO CLOSE
INTOLERANT OF A FORCE THEY COULD NOT HOUSE
SOME DRAWN UNWILLINGLY BY HER DIVINE SWAY
ENDURED IT LIKE A SWEET BUT ALIEN SPELL
UNABLE TO MOUNT TO LEVELS TOO SUBLIME
THEY YEARNED TO DRAW HER DOWN TO THEIR OWN EARTH
OR FORCED TO CENTRE ROUND HER THEIR PASSIONATE LIVES
THEY HOPED TO BIND TO THEIR HEART'S HUMAN NEEDS
HER GLORY AND GRACE THAT HAD ENSLAVED THEIR SOULS
BUT MID THIS WORLD THESE HEARTS THAT ANSWERED HER CALL
NONE COULD STAND UP HER EQUAL AND HER MATE
IN VAIN SHE STOOPED TO EQUAL THEM WITH HER HEIGHTS
TOO PURE THAT AIR WAS FOR SMALL SOULS TO BREATHE
THESE COMRADE SELVES TO RAISE TO HER OWN WIDE BREADTHS
HER HEART DESIRED AND FILL WITH HER OWN POWER
366
THAT A DIVINER FORCE MIGHT ENTER LIFE
A BREATH OF GODHEAD GREATEN HUMAN TIME
ALTHOUGH SHE LEANED DOWN TO THEIR LITTLENESS
COVERING THEIR LIVES WITH HER STRONG PASSIONATE HANDS
AND KNEW BY SYMPATHY THEIR NEEDS AND WANTS
AND DIVED IN THE SHALLOW WAVE-DEPTHS OF THEIR LIVES
AND MET AND SHARED THEIR HEART-BEATS OF GRIEF AND JOY
AND BENT TO HEAL THEIR SORROW AND THEIR PRIDE
LAVISHING THE MIGHT THAT WAS HERS ON HER LONE PEAK
TO LIFT TO IT THEIR ASPIRATION'S CRY
AND THOUGH SHE DREW THEIR SOULS INTO HER VAST
AND SURROUNDED WITH THE SILENCE OF HER DEEPS
AND HELD AS THE GREAT MOTHER HOLDS HER OWN
ONLY HER EARTHLY SURFACE BORE THEIR CHARGE
AND MIXED ITS FIRE WITH THEIR MORTALITY
HER GREATER SELF LIVED SOLE UNCLAIMED WITHIN
OFTENER IN DUMB NATURE'S STIR AND PEACE
A NEARNESS SHE COULD FEEL SERENELY ONE
THE FORCE IN HER DREW EARTH'S SUBHUMAN BROODS
AND TO HER SPIRIT'S LARGE AND FREE DELIGHT
SHE JOINED THE ARDENT-HUED MAGNIFICENT LIVES
OF ANIMAL AND BIRD AND FLOWER AND TREE
THEY ANSWERED TO HER WITH THE SIMPLE HEART
IN MAN A DIM DISTURBING SOMEWHAT LIVES
IT KNOWS BUT TURNS AWAY FROM DIVINE LIGHT
PREFERRING THE DARK IGNORANCE OF THE FALL
AMONG THE MANY WHO CAME DRAWN TO HER
NOWHERE SHE FOUND HER PARTNER OF HIGH TASKS
THE COMRADE OF HER SOUL HER OTHER SELF
WHO WAS MADE WITH HER LIKE GOD AND NATURE ONE
SOME NEAR APPROACHED WERE TOUCHED CAUGHT FIRE THEN FAILED
TOO GREAT WAS HER DEMAND TOO PURE HER FORCE
THUS LIGHTING EARTH AROUND HER LIKE A SUN
YET IN HER INMOST SKY AN ORB ALOOF
A DISTANCE SEVERED HER FROM THOSE MOST CLOSE
PUISSANT APART HER SOUL AS THE GODS LIVE
367
AS YET UNLINKED WITH THE BROAD HUMAN SCENE
IN A SMALL CIRCLE OF YOUNG EAGER HEARTS
HER BEING'S EARLY SCHOOL AND CLOSED DOMAIN
APPRENTICE IN THE BUSINESS OF EARTH-LIFE
SHE SCHOOLED HER HEAVENLY STRAIN TO BEAR ITS TOUCH
CONTENT IN HER LITTLE GARDEN OF THE GODS
AS BLOOMS A FLOWER IN AN UNVISITED PLACE
EARTH NURSED UNCONSCIOUS STILL THE INHABITING FLAME
YET SOMETHING DEEPLY STIRRED AND DIMLY KNEW
THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AND A PASSIONATE CALL
A RAINBOW DREAM A HOPE OF GOLDEN CHANGE
SOME SECRET WING OF EXPECTATION BEAT
A GROWING SENSE OF SOMETHING NEW AND RARE
AND BEAUTIFUL STOLE ACROSS THE HEART OF TIME
THEN A FAINT WHISPER OF HER TOUCHED THE SOIL
BREATHED LIKE A HIDDEN NEED THE SOUL DIVINES
THE EYE OF THE GREAT WORLD DISCOVERED HER
AND WONDER LIFTED UP ITS BARDIC VOICE
A KEY TO A LIGHT STILL KEPT IN BEING'S CAVE
THE SUN-WORD OF AN ANCIENT MYSTERY'S SENSE
HER NAME RAN MURMURING ON THE LIPS OF MEN
EXALTED AND SWEET LIKE AN INSPIRED VERSE
STRUCK FROM THE EPIC LYRE OF RUMOUR'S WINDS
OR SUNG LIKE A CHANTED THOUGHT BY THE POET FAME
BUT LIKE A SACRED SYMBOL'S WAS THAT CULT
ADMIRED UNSOUGHT INTANGIBLE TO THE GRASP
HER BEAUTY AND FLAMING STRENGTH WERE SEEN AFAR
LIKE LIGHTNING PLAYING WITH THE FALLEN DAY
A GLORY UNAPPROACHABLY DIVINE
NO EQUAL HEART CAME CLOSE TO JOIN HER HEART
NO TRANSIENT EARTHLY LOVE ASSAILED HER CALM
NO HERO PASSION HAD THE STRENGTH TO SEIZE
NO EYES DEMANDED HER REPLYING EYES
A POWER WITHIN HER AWED THE IMPERFECT FLESH
THE SELF-PROTECTING GENIUS IN OUR CLAY
DIVINED THE GODDESS IN THE WOMAN'S SHAPE
368
AND DREW BACK FROM A TOUCH BEYOND ITS KIND
THE EARTH-NATURE BOUND IN SENSE-LIFE'S NARROW MAKE
THE HEARTS OF MEN ARE AMOROUS OF CLAY-KIN
AND BEAR NOT SPIRITS LONE AND HIGH WHO BRING
FIRE-INTIMATIONS FROM THE DEATHLESS PLANES
TOO VAST FOR SOULS NOT BORN TO MATE WITH HEAVEN
WHOEVER IS TOO GREAT MUST LONELY LIVE
ADORED HE WALKS IN MIGHTY SOLITUDE
VAIN IS HIS LABOUR TO CREATE HIS KIND
HIS ONLY COMRADE IS THE STRENGTH WITHIN
THUS WAS IT FOR A WHILE WITH SAVITRI
ALL WORSHIPPED MARVELLINGLY NONE DARED TO CLAIM
HER MIND SAT HIGH POURING ITS GOLDEN BEAMS
HER HEART WAS A CROWDED TEMPLE OF DELIGHT
A SINGLE LAMP LIT IN PERFECTION'S HOUSE
A BRIGHT PURE IMAGE IN A PRIESTLESS SHRINE
MIDST THOSE ENCIRCLING LIVES HER SPIRIT DWELT
APART IN HERSELF UNTIL HER HOUR OF FATE
369
A MORN THAT SEEMED A NEW CREATION'S FRONT
BRINGING A GREATER SUNLIGHT HAPPIER SKIES
CAME BURDENED WITH A BEAUTY MOVED AND STRANGE
OUT OF THE CHANGELESS ORIGIN OF THINGS
AN ANCIENT LONGING STRUCK AGAIN NEW ROOTS
THE AIR DRANK DEEP OF UNFULFILLED DESIRE
THE HIGH TREES TREMBLED WITH A WANDERING WIND
LIKE SOULS THAT QUIVER AT THE APPROACH OF JOY
AND IN A BOSOM OF GREEN SECRECY
FOR EVER OF ITS ONE LOVE-NOTE UNTIRED
A LYRIC COIL CRIED AMONG THE LEAVES
AWAY FROM THE TERRESTRIAL MURMUR TURNED
WHERE TRANSIENT CALLS AND ANSWERS MIX THEIR FLOOD
KING ASWAPATI LISTENED THROUGH THE RAY
TO OTHER SOUNDS THAN MEET THE SENSE-FORMED EAR
ON A SUBTLE INTERSPACE WHICH RINGS OUR LIFE
UNLOCKED WERE THE INNER SPIRIT'S TRANCE-CLOSED DOORS
THE INAUDIBLE STRAIN IN NATURE COULD BE CAUGHT
ACROSS THIS CYCLIC TRAMP OF EAGER LIVES
ACROSS THE DEEP URGENCY OF PRESENT CARES
EARTH'S WORDLESS HYMN TO THE INEFFABLE
AROSE FROM THE SILENT HEART OF THE COSMIC VOID
HE HEARD THE VOICE REPRESSED OF UNBORN POWERS
MURMURING BEHIND THE LUMINOUS BARS OF TIME
AGAIN THE MIGHTY YEARNING RAISED ITS FLAME
THAT ASKS A PERFECT LIFE ON EARTH FOR MEN
AND PRAYS FOR CERTAINTY IN THE UNCERTAIN MIND
AND SHADOWLESS BLISS FOR SUFFERING HUMAN HEARTS
AND TRUTH EMBODIED IN AN IGNORANT WORLD
AND GODHEAD DIVINISING MORTAL FORMS
A WORD THAT LEAPED FROM SOME FAR SKY OF THOUGHT
370
ADMITTED BY THE COWLED RECEIVING SCRIBE
TRAVERSED THE ECHOING PASSAGES OF HIS BRAIN
AND LEFT ITS STAMP ON THE RECORDING CELLS
O FORCE-COMPELLED FATE-DRIVEN EARTH-BORN RACE
O PETTY ADVENTURERS IN AN INFINITE WORLD
AND PRISONERS OF A DWARF HUMANITY
HOW LONG WILL YOU TREAD THE CIRCLING TRACKS OF MIND
AROUND YOUR LITTLE SELF AND PETTY THINGS
BUT NOT FOR A CHANGELESS LITTLENESS WERE YOU MEANT
NOT FOR VAIN REPETITION WERE YOU BUILT
OUT OF THE IMMORTAL'S SUBSTANCE YOU WERE MADE
YOUR ACTIONS CAN BE SWIFT REVEALING STEPS
YOUR LIFE A CHANGEFUL MOULD FOR GROWING GODS
A SEER A STRONG CREATOR IS WITHIN
THE IMMACULATE GRANDEUR BROODS UPON YOUR DAYS
ALMIGHTY POWERS ARE SHUT IN NATURE'S CELLS
A GREATER DESTINY WAITS YOU IN YOUR FRONT
THIS TRANSIENT EARTHLY BEING IF HE WILLS
CAN FIT HIS ACTS TO A TRANSCENDENT SCHEME
HE WHO NOW STARES AT THE WORLD WITH IGNORANT EYES
HARDLY FROM THE INCONSCIENT'S NIGHT AROUSED
THAT LOOK AT IMAGES AND NOT AT TRUTH
CAN FILL THOSE ORBS WITH AN IMMORTAL'S SIGHT
YET SHALL THE GODHEAD GROW WITHIN YOUR HEARTS
YOU SHALL AWAKE INTO THE SPIRIT'S AIR
AND FEEL THE BREAKING WALLS OF MORTAL MIND
AND HEAR THE MESSAGE WHICH LEFT LIFE'S HEART DUMB
AND LOOK THROUGH NATURE WITH SUN-GAZING LIDS
AND BLOW YOUR CONCH-SHELLS AT THE ETERNAL'S GATE
AUTHORS OF EARTH'S HIGH CHANGE TO YOU IT IS GIVEN
TO CROSS THE DANGEROUS SPACES OF THE SOUL
AND TOUCH THE MIGHTY MOTHER STARK AWAKE
AND MEET THE OMNIPOTENT IN THIS HOUSE OF FLESH
AND MAKE OF LIFE THE MILLION-BODIED ONE
THE EARTH YOU TREAD IS A BORDER SCREENED FROM HEAVEN
THE LIFE YOU LEAD CONCEALS THE LIGHT YOU ARE
371
IMMORTAL POWERS SWEEP FLAMING PAST YOUR DOORS
FAR-OFF UPON YOUR TOPS THE GOD-CHANT SOUNDS
WHILE TO EXCEED YOURSELVES THOUGHT'S TRUMPETS CALL
HEARD BY A FEW BUT FEWER DARE ASPIRE
THE NYMPHOLEPTS OF THE ECSTASY AND THE BLAZE
AN EPIC OF HOPE AND FAILURE BREAKS EARTH'S HEART
HER FORCE AND WILL EXCEED HER FORM AND FATE
A GODDESS IN A NET OF TRANSIENCE CAUGHT
SELF-BOUND IN THE PASTURES OF DEATH SHE DREAMS OF LIFE
SELF-RACKED WITH THE PAINS OF HELL ASPIRES TO JOY
AND BUILDS TO HOPE HER ALTARS OF DESPAIR
KNOWS THAT ONE HIGH STEP MIGHT ENFRANCHISE ALL
AND SUFFERING LOOKS FOR GREATNESS IN HER SONS
BUT DIM IN HUMAN HEARTS THE ASCENDING FIRE
THE INVISIBLE GRANDEUR SITS UNWORSHIPPED THERE
MAN SEES THE HIGHEST IN A LIMITING FORM
OR LOOKS UPON A PERSON HEARS A NAME
HE TURNS FOR LITTLE GAINS TO IGNORANT POWERS
OR KINDLES HIS ALTAR LIGHTS TO A DEMON FACE
HE LOVES THE IGNORANCE FATHERING HIS PAIN
A SPELL IS LAID UPON HIS GLORIOUS STRENGTHS
HE HAS LOST THE INNER VOICE THAT LED HIS THOUGHTS
AND MASKING THE ORACULAR TRIPOD SEAT
A SPECIOUS IDOL FILLS THE MARVEL SHRINE
THE GREAT ILLUSION WRAPS HIM IN ITS VEILS
THE SOUL'S DEEP INTIMATIONS COME IN VAIN
IN VAIN IS THE UNENDING LINE OF SEERS
THE SAGES PONDER IN UNSUBSTANTIAL LIGHT
THE POETS LEND THEIR VOICE TO OUTWARD DREAMS
A HOMELESS FIRE INSPIRES THE PROPHET TONGUES
HEAVEN'S FLAMING LIGHTS DESCEND AND BACK RETURN
THE LUMINOUS EYE APPROACHES AND RETIRES
ETERNITY SPEAKS NONE UNDERSTANDS ITS WORD
FATE IS UNWILLING AND THE ABYSS DENIES
THE INCONSCIENT'S MINDLESS WATERS BLOCK ALL DONE
ONLY A LITTLE LIFTED IS MIND'S SCREEN
372
THE WISE WHO KNOW SEE BUT ONE HALF OF TRUTH
THE STRONG CLIMB HARDLY TO A LOW-PEAKED HEIGHT
THE HEARTS THAT YEARN ARE GIVEN ONE HOUR TO LOVE
HIS TALE HALF TOLD FALTERS THE SECRET BARD
THE GODS ARE STILL TOO FEW IN MORTAL FORMS
THE VOICE WITHDREW INTO ITS HIDDEN SKIES
BUT LIKE A SHINING ANSWER FROM THE GODS
APPROACHED THROUGH SUN-BRIGHT SPACES SAVITRI
ADVANCING AMID TALL HEAVEN-PILLARING TREES
APPARELLED IN HER FLICKERING-COLOURED ROBE
SHE SEEMED BURNING TOWARDS THE ETERNAL REALMS
A BRIGHT MOVED TORCH OF INCENSE AND OF FLAME
THAT FROM THE SKY-ROOFED TEMPLE-SOIL OF EARTH
A PILGRIM HAND LIFTS IN AN INVISIBLE SHRINE
THERE CAME THE GIFT OF A REVEALING HOUR
HE SAW THROUGH DEPTHS THAT REINTERPRET ALL
LIMITED NOT NOW BY THE DULL BODY'S EYES
NEW-FOUND THROUGH AN ARCH OF CLEAR DISCOVERY
THIS INTIMATION OF THE WORLD'S DELIGHT
THIS WONDER OF THE DIVINE ARTIST'S MAKE
CARVED LIKE A NECTAR-CUP FOR THIRSTY GODS
THIS BREATHING SCRIPTURE OF THE ETERNAL'S JOY
THIS NET OF SWEETNESS WOVEN OF AUREATE FIRE
TRANSFORMED THE DELICATE IMAGE-FACE BECAME
A DEEPER NATURE'S SELF-REVEALING SIGN
A GOLD-LEAF PALIMPSEST OF SACRED BIRTHS
A GRAVE WORLD-SYMBOL CHISELLED OUT OF LIFE
HER BROW A COPY OF CLEAR UNSTAINED HEAVENS
WAS MEDITATION'S PEDESTAL AND DEFENCE
THE VERY ROOM AND SMILE OF MUSING SPACE
ITS BROODING LINE INFINITY'S SYMBOL CURVE
AMID HER TRESSES' CLOUDY MULTITUDE
HER LONG EYES SHADOWED AS BY WINGS OF NIGHT
UNDER THAT MOON-GOLD FOREHEAD'S DREAMING BREADTH
WERE SEAS OF LOVE AND THOUGHT THAT HELD THE WORLD
MARVELLING AT LIFE AND EARTH THEY SAW TRUTHS FAR
373
A DEATHLESS MEANING FILLED HER MORTAL LIMBS
AS IN A GOLDEN VASE'S POIGNANT LINE
THEY SEEMED TO CARRY THE RHYTHMIC SOB OF BLISS
OF EARTH'S MUTE ADORATION TOWARDS HEAVEN
RELEASED IN BEAUTY'S CRY OF LIVING FORM
TOWARDS THE PERFECTION OF ETERNAL THINGS
TRANSPARENT GROWN THE EPHEMERAL LIVING DRESS
BARED THE EXPRESSIVE DEITY TO HIS VIEW
ESCAPED FROM SURFACE SIGHT AND MORTAL SENSE
THE SEIZING HARMONY OF ITS SHAPES BECAME
THE STRANGE SIGNIFICANT ICON OF A POWER
RENEWING ITS INSCRUTABLE DESCENT
INTO A HUMAN FIGURE OF ITS WORKS
THAT STOOD OUT IN LIFE'S BOLD ABRUPT RELIEF
ON THE SOIL OF THE EVOLVING UNIVERSE
A GODHEAD SCULPTURED ON A WALL OF THOUGHT
MIRRORED IN THE FLOWING HOURS AND DIMLY SHRINED
IN MATTER AS IN A CATHEDRAL CAVE
ANNULLED WERE THE TRANSIENT VALUES OF THE MIND
THE BODY'S SENSE RENOUNCED ITS EARTHLY LOOK
IMMORTAL MET IMMORTAL IN THEIR GAZE
AWAKED FROM THE CLOSE SPELL OF DAILY USE
THAT HIDES SOUL-TRUTH WITH THE OUTWARD FORM'S DISGUISE
HE SAW THROUGH THE FAMILIAR CHERISHED LIMBS
THE GREAT AND UNKNOWN SPIRIT BORN HIS CHILD
AN IMPROMPTU FROM THE DEEPER SIGHT WITHIN
THOUGHTS ROSE IN HIM THAT KNEW NOT THEIR OWN SCOPE
THEN TO THOSE LARGE AND BROODING DEPTHS WHENCE LOVE
REGARDED HIM ACROSS THE STRAITS OF MIND
HE SPOKE IN SENTENCES FROM THE UNSEEN HEIGHTS
FOR THE HIDDEN PROMPTERS OF OUR SPEECH SOMETIMES
CAN USE THE FORMULAS OF A MOMENT'S MOOD
TO WEIGH UNCONSCIOUS LIPS WITH WORDS FROM FATE
A CASUAL PASSING PHRASE CAN CHANGE OUR LIFE
O SPIRIT TRAVELLER OF ETERNITY
WHO CAM'ST FROM THE IMMORTAL SPACES HERE
374
ARMED FOR THE SPLENDID HAZARD OF THY LIFE
TO SET THY CONQUERING FOOT ON CHANCE AND TIME
THE MOON SHUT IN HER HALO DREAMS LIKE THEE
A MIGHTY PRESENCE STILL DEFENDS THY FRAME
PERHAPS THE HEAVENS GUARD THEE FOR SOME GREAT SOUL
THY FATE THY WORK ARE KEPT SOMEWHERE AFAR
THY SPIRIT CAME NOT DOWN A STAR ALONE
O LIVING INSCRIPTION OF THE BEAUTY OF LOVE
MISSALLED IN AUREATE VIRGINITY
WHAT MESSAGE OF HEAVENLY STRENGTH AND BLISS IN THEE
IS WRITTEN WITH THE ETERNAL'S SUN-WHITE SCRIPT
ONE SHALL DISCOVER AND GREATEN WITH IT HIS LIFE
TO WHOM THOU LOOSENEST THY HEART'S JEWELLED STRINGS
O RUBIES OF SILENCE LIPS FROM WHICH THERE STOLE
LOW LAUGHTER MUSIC OF TRANQUILLITY
STAR-LUSTROUS EYES AWAKE IN SWEET LARGE NIGHT
AND LIMBS LIKE FINE-LINKED POEMS MADE OF GOLD
STANZAED TO GLIMMERING CURVES BY ARTIST GODS
DEPART WHERE LOVE AND DESTINY CALL YOUR CHARM
VENTURE THROUGH THE DEEP WORLD TO FIND THY MATE
FOR SOMEWHERE ON THE LONGING BREAST OF EARTH
THY UNKNOWN LOVER WAITS FOR THEE THE UNKNOWN
THY SOUL HAS STRENGTH AND NEEDS NO OTHER GUIDE
THAN ONE WHO BURNS WITHIN THY BOSOM'S POWERS
THERE SHALL DRAW NEAR TO MEET THY APPROACHING STEPS
THE SECOND SELF FOR WHOM THY NATURE ASKS
HE WHO SHALL WALK UNTIL THY BODY'S END
A CLOSE-BOUND TRAVELLER PACING WITH THY PACE
THE LYRIST OF THY SOUL'S MOST INTIMATE CHORDS
WHO SHALL GIVE VOICE TO WHAT IN THEE IS MUTE
THEN SHALL YOU GROW LIKE VIBRANT KINDRED HARPS
ONE IN THE BEATS OF DIFFERENCE AND DELIGHT
RESPONSIVE IN DIVINE AND EQUAL STRAINS
DISCOVERING NEW NOTES OF THE ETERNAL THEME
ONE FORCE SHALL BE YOUR MOVER AND YOUR GUIDE
ONE LIGHT SHALL BE AROUND YOU AND WITHIN
375
HAND IN STRONG HAND CONFRONT HEAVEN'S QUESTION LIFE
CHALLENGE THE ORDEAL OF THE IMMENSE DISGUISE
ASCEND FROM NATURE TO DIVINITY'S HEIGHTS
FACE THE HIGH GODS CROWNED WITH FELICITY
THEN MEET A GREATER GOD THY SELF BEYOND TIME
THIS WORD WAS SEED OF ALL THE THING TO BE
A HAND FROM SOME GREATNESS OPENED HER HEART'S LOCKED DOORS
AND SHOWED THE WORK FOR WHICH HER STRENGTH WAS BORN
AS WHEN THE MANTRA SINKS IN YOGA'S EAR
ITS MESSAGE ENTERS STIRRING THE BLIND BRAIN
AND KEEPS IN THE DIM IGNORANT CELLS ITS SOUND
THE HEARER UNDERSTANDS A FORM OF WORDS
AND MUSING ON THE INDEX THOUGHT IT HOLDS
HE STRIVES TO READ IT WITH THE LABOURING MIND
BUT FINDS BRIGHT HINTS NOT THE EMBODIED TRUTH
THEN FALLING SILENT IN HIMSELF TO KNOW
HE MEETS THE DEEPER LISTENING OF HIS SOUL
THE WORD REPEATS ITSELF IN RHYTHMIC STRAINS
THOUGHT VISION FEELING SENSE THE BODY'S SELF
ARE SEIZED UNUTTERABLY AND HE ENDURES
AN ECSTASY AND AN IMMORTAL CHANGE
HE FEELS A WIDENESS AND BECOMES A POWER
ALL KNOWLEDGE RUSHES ON HIM LIKE A SEA
TRANSMUTED BY THE WHITE SPIRITUAL RAY
HE WALKS IN NAKED HEAVENS OF JOY AND CALM
SEES THE GOD-FACE AND HEARS TRANSCENDENT SPEECH
AN EQUAL GREATNESS IN HER LIFE WAS SOWN
ACCUSTOMED SCENES WERE NOW AN ENDED PLAY
MOVING IN MUSE AMID FAMILIAR POWERS
TOUCHED BY NEW MAGNITUDES AND FIERY SIGNS
SHE TURNED TO VASTNESSES NOT YET HER OWN
ALLURED HER HEART THROBBED TO UNKNOWN SWEETNESSES
THE SECRETS OF AN UNSEEN WORLD WERE CLOSE
THE MORN WENT UP INTO A SMILING SKY
CAST FROM ITS SAPPHIRE PINNACLE OF TRANCE
DAY SANK INTO THE BURNING GOLD OF EVE
376
THE MOON FLOATED A LUMINOUS WAIF THROUGH HEAVEN
AND SANK BELOW THE OBLIVIOUS EDGE OF DREAM
NIGHT LIT THE WATCH-FIRES OF ETERNITY
THEN ALL WENT BACK INTO MIND'S SECRET CAVES
A DARKNESS STOOPING ON THE HEAVEN-BIRD'S WINGS
SEALED IN HER SENSES FROM EXTERNAL SIGHT
AND OPENED THE STUPENDOUS DEPTHS OF SLEEP
WHEN THE PALE DAWN SLIPPED THROUGH NIGHT'S SHADOWY GUARD
VAINLY THE NEW-BORN LIGHT DESIRED HER FACE
THE PALACE WOKE TO ITS OWN EMPTINESS
THE SOVEREIGN OF ITS DAILY JOYS WAS FAR
HER MOONBEAM FEET TINGED NOT THE LUCENT FLOORS
THE BEAUTY AND DIVINITY WERE GONE
DELIGHT HAD FLED TO SEARCH THE SPACIOUS WORLD
377
THE WORLD-WAYS OPENED BEFORE SAVITRI
AT FIRST A STRANGENESS OF NEW BRILLIANT SCENES
PEOPLED HER MIND AND KEPT HER BODY'S GAZE
BUT AS SHE MOVED ACROSS THE CHANGING EARTH
A DEEPER CONSCIOUSNESS WELLED UP IN HER
A CITIZEN OF MANY SCENES AND CLIMES
EACH SOIL AND COUNTRY IT HAD MADE ITS HOME
IT TOOK ALL CLANS AND PEOPLES FOR HER OWN
TILL THE WHOLE DESTINY OF MANKIND WAS HERS
THESE UNFAMILIAR SPACES ON HER WAY
WERE KNOWN AND NEIGHBOURS TO A SENSE WITHIN
LANDSCAPES RECURRED LIKE LOST FORGOTTEN FIELDS
CITIES AND RIVERS AND PLAINS HER VISION CLAIMED
LIKE SLOW-RECURRING MEMORIES IN FRONT
THE STARS AT NIGHT WERE HER PAST'S BRILLIANT FRIENDS
THE WINDS MURMURED TO HER OF ANCIENT THINGS
AND SHE MET NAMELESS COMRADES LOVED BY HER ONCE
ALL WAS A PART OF OLD FORGOTTEN SELVES
VAGUELY OR WITH A FLASH OF SUDDEN HINTS
HER ACTS RECALLED A LINE OF BYGONE POWER
EVEN HER MOTION'S PURPOSE WAS NOT NEW
TRAVELLER TO A PREFIGURED HIGH EVENT
SHE SEEMED TO HER REMEMBERING WITNESS SOUL
TO TRACE AGAIN A JOURNEY OFTEN MADE
A GUIDANCE TURNED THE DUMB REVOLVING WHEELS
AND IN THE EAGER BODY OF THEIR SPEED
THE DIM-MASKED HOODED GODHEADS RODE WHO MOVE
ASSIGNED TO MAN IMMUTABLY FROM HIS BIRTH
RECEIVERS OF THE INNER AND OUTER LAW
AT ONCE THE AGENTS OF HIS SPIRIT'S WILL
AND WITNESSES AND EXECUTORS OF HIS FATE
378
INEXORABLY FAITHFUL TO THEIR TASK
THEY HOLD HIS NATURE'S SEQUENCE IN THEIR GUARD
CARRYING THE UNBROKEN THREAD OLD LIVES HAVE SPUN
ATTENDANTS ON HIS DESTINY'S MEASURED WALK
LEADING TO JOYS HE HAS WON AND PAINS HE HAS CALLED
EVEN IN HIS CASUAL STEPS THEY INTERVENE
NOTHING WE THINK OR DO IS VOID OR VAIN
EACH IS AN ENERGY LOOSED AND HOLDS ITS COURSE
THE SHADOWY KEEPERS OF OUR DEATHLESS PAST
HAVE MADE OUR FATE THE CHILD OF OUR OWN ACTS
AND FROM THE FURROWS LABOURED BY OUR WILL
WE REAP THE FRUIT OF OUR FORGOTTEN DEEDS
BUT SINCE UNSEEN THE TREE THAT BORE THIS FRUIT
AND WE LIVE IN A PRESENT BORN FROM AN UNKNOWN PAST
THEY SEEM BUT PARTS OF A MECHANIC FORCE
TO A MECHANIC MIND TIED BY EARTH'S LAWS
YET ARE THEY INSTRUMENTS OF A WILL SUPREME
WATCHED BY A STILL ALL-SEEING EYE ABOVE
A PRESCIENT ARCHITECT OF FATE AND CHANCE
WHO BUILDS OUR LIVES ON A FORESEEN DESIGN
THE MEANING KNOWS AND CONSEQUENCE OF EACH STEP
AND WATCHES THE INFERIOR STUMBLING POWERS
UPON HER SILENT HEIGHTS SHE WAS AWARE
OF A CALM PRESENCE THRONED ABOVE HER BROWS
WHO SAW THE GOAL AND CHOSE EACH FATEFUL CURVE
IT USED THE BODY FOR ITS PEDESTAL
THE EYES THAT WANDERED WERE ITS SEARCHLIGHT FIRES
THE HANDS THAT HELD THE REINS ITS LIVING TOOLS
ALL WAS THE WORKING OF AN ANCIENT PLAN
A WAY PROPOSED BY AN UNERRING GUIDE
ACROSS WIDE NOONS AND GLOWING AFTERNOONS
SHE MET WITH NATURE AND WITH HUMAN FORMS
AND LISTENED TO THE VOICES OF THE WORLD
DRIVEN FROM WITHIN SHE FOLLOWED HER LONG ROAD
MUTE IN THE LUMINOUS CAVERN OF HER HEART
LIKE A BRIGHT CLOUD THROUGH THE RESPLENDENT DAY
379
AT FIRST HER PATH RAN FAR THROUGH PEOPLED TRACTS
ADMITTED TO THE LION EYE OF STATES
AND THEATRES OF THE LOUD ACT OF MAN
HER CARVEN CHARIOT WITH ITS FRETTED WHEELS
THREADED THROUGH CLAMOROUS MARTS AND SENTINEL TOWERS
PAST FIGURED GATES AND HIGH DREAM-SCULPTURED FRONTS
AND GARDENS HUNG IN THE SAPPHIRE OF THE SKIES
PILLARED ASSEMBLY HALLS WITH ARMOURED GUARDS
SMALL FANES WHERE ONE CALM IMAGE WATCHED MAN'S LIFE
AND TEMPLES HEWN AS IF BY EXILED GODS
TO IMITATE THEIR LOST ETERNITY
OFTEN FROM GILDED DUSK TO ARGENT DAWN
WHERE JEWEL-LAMPS FLICKERED ON FRESCOED WALLS
AND THE STONE LATTICE STARED AT MOONLIT BOUGHS
HALF-CONSCIOUS OF THE TARDY LISTENING NIGHT
DIMLY SHE GLIDED BETWEEN BANKS OF SLEEP
AT REST IN THE SLUMBERING PALACES OF KINGS
HAMLET AND VILLAGE SAW THE FATE-WAIN PASS
HOMES OF A LIFE BENT TO THE SOIL IT PLOUGHS
FOR SUSTENANCE OF ITS SHORT AND PASSING DAYS
THAT TRANSIENT KEEP THEIR OLD REPEATED COURSE
UNCHANGING IN THE CIRCLE OF A SKY
WHICH ALTERS NOT ABOVE OUR MORTAL TOIL
AWAY FROM THIS THINKING CREATURE'S BURDENED HOURS
TO FREE AND GRIEFLESS SPACES NOW SHE TURNED
NOT YET PERTURBED BY HUMAN JOYS AND FEARS
HERE WAS THE CHILDHOOD OF PRIMAEVAL EARTH
HERE TIMELESS MUSINGS LARGE AND GLAD AND STILL
MEN HAD FORBORNE AS YET TO FILL WITH CARES
IMPERIAL ACRES OF THE ETERNAL SOWER
AND WIND-STIRRED GRASS-LANDS WINKING IN THE SUN
OR MID GREEN MUSING OF WOODS AND ROUGH-BROWED HILLS
IN THE GROVE'S MURMUROUS BEE-AIR HUMMING WILD
OR PAST THE LONG LAPSING VOICE OF SILVER FLOODS
LIKE A SWIFT HOPE JOURNEYING AMONG ITS DREAMS
HASTENED THE CHARIOT OF THE GOLDEN BRIDE
380
OUT OF THE WORLD'S IMMENSE UNHUMAN PAST
TRACT-MEMORIES AND AGELESS REMNANTS CAME
DOMAINS OF LIGHT ENFEOFFED TO ANTIQUE CALM
LISTENED TO THE UNACCUSTOMED SOUND OF HOOVES
AND LARGE IMMUNE ENTANGLED SILENCES
ABSORBED HER INTO EMERALD SECRECY
AND SLOW HUSHED WIZARD NETS OF FIERY BLOOM
ENVIRONED WITH THEIR COLOURED SNARE HER WHEELS
THE STRONG IMPORTUNATE FEET OF TIME FELL SOFT
ALONG THESE LONELY WAYS HIS TITAN PACE
FORGOTTEN AND HIS STARK AND RUINOUS ROUNDS
THE INNER EAR THAT LISTENS TO SOLITUDE
LEANING SELF-RAPT UNBOUNDEDLY COULD HEAR
THE RHYTHM OF THE INTENSER WORDLESS THOUGHT
THAT GATHERS IN THE SILENCE BEHIND LIFE
AND THE LOW SWEET INARTICULATE VOICE OF EARTH
IN THE GREAT PASSION OF HER SUN-KISSED TRANCE
ASCENDED WITH ITS YEARNING UNDERTONE
AFAR FROM THE BRUTE NOISE OF CLAMOROUS NEEDS
THE QUIETED ALL-SEEKING MIND COULD FEEL
AT REST FROM ITS BLIND OUTWARDNESS OF WILL
THE UNWEARIED CLASP OF HER MUTE PATIENT LOVE
AND KNOW FOR A SOUL THE MOTHER OF OUR FORMS
THIS SPIRIT STUMBLING IN THE FIELDS OF SENSE
THIS CREATURE BRUISED IN THE MORTAR OF THE DAYS
COULD FIND IN HER BROAD SPACES OF RELEASE
NOT YET WAS A WORLD ALL OCCUPIED BY CARE
THE BOSOM OF OUR MOTHER KEPT FOR US STILL
HER AUSTERE REGIONS AND HER MUSING DEPTHS
HER IMPERSONAL REACHES LONELY AND INSPIRED
AND THE MIGHTINESSES OF HER RAPTURE HAUNTS
MUSE-LIPPED SHE NURSED HER SYMBOL MYSTERIES
AND GUARDED FOR HER PURE-EYED SACRAMENTS
THE VALLEY CLEFTS BETWEEN HER BREASTS OF JOY
HER MOUNTAIN ALTARS FOR THE FIRES OF DAWN
AND NUPTIAL BEACHES WHERE THE OCEAN COUCHED
381
AND THE HUGE CHANTING OF HER PROPHET WOODS
FIELDS HAD SHE OF HER SOLITARY MIRTH
PLAINS HUSHED AND HAPPY IN THE EMBRACE OF LIGHT
ALONE WITH THE CRY OF BIRDS AND HUE OF FLOWERS
AND WILDERNESSES OF WONDER LIT BY HER MOONS
AND GREY SEER-EVENINGS KINDLING WITH THE STARS
AND DIM MOVEMENT IN THE NIGHT'S INFINITUDE
AUGUST EXULTING IN HER MAKER'S EYE
SHE FELT HER NEARNESS TO HIM IN EARTH'S BREAST
CONVERSED STILL WITH A LIGHT BEHIND THE VEIL
STILL COMMUNED WITH ETERNITY BEYOND
A FEW AND FIT INHABITANTS SHE CALLED
TO SHARE THE GLAD COMMUNION OF HER PEACE
THE BREADTH THE SUMMIT WERE THEIR NATURAL HOME
THE STRONG KING-SAGES FROM THEIR LABOUR DONE
FREED FROM THE WARRIOR TENSION OF THEIR TASK
CAME TO HER SERENE SESSIONS IN THESE WILDS
THE STRIFE WAS OVER THE RESPITE LAY IN FRONT
HAPPY THEY LIVED WITH BIRDS AND BEASTS AND FLOWERS
AND SUNLIGHT AND THE RUSTLE OF THE LEAVES
AND HEARD THE WILD WINDS WANDERING IN THE NIGHT
MUSED WITH THE STARS IN THEIR MUTE CONSTANT RANKS
AND LODGED IN THE MORNINGS AS IN AZURE TENTS
AND WITH THE GLORY OF THE NOONS WERE ONE
SOME DEEPER PLUNGED FROM LIFE'S EXTERNAL CLASP
BECKONED INTO A FIERY PRIVACY
IN THE SOUL'S UNPROFANED STAR-WHITE RECESS
THEY SOJOURNED WITH AN EVERLIVING BLISS
A VOICE PROFOUND IN THE ECSTASY AND THE HUSH
THEY HEARD BEHELD AN ALL-REVEALING LIGHT
ALL TIME-MADE DIFFERENCE THEY OVERCAME
THE WORLD WAS FIBRED WITH THEIR OWN HEART-STRINGS
CLOSE DRAWN TO THE HEART THAT BEATS IN EVERY BREAST
THEY REACHED THE ONE SELF IN ALL THROUGH BOUNDLESS LOVE
ATTUNED TO SILENCE AND TO THE WORLD-RHYME
THEY LOOSENED THE KNOT OF THE IMPRISONING MIND
382
ACHIEVED WAS THE WIDE UNTROUBLED WITNESS GAZE
UNSEALED WAS NATURE'S GREAT SPIRITUAL EYE
TO THE HEIGHT OF HEIGHTS ROSE NOW THEIR DAILY CLIMB
TRUTH LEANED TO THEM FROM HER SUPERNAL REALM
ABOVE THEM BLAZED ETERNITY'S MYSTIC SUNS
NAMELESS THE AUSTERE ASCETICS WITHOUT HOME
ABANDONING SPEECH AND MOTION AND DESIRE
ALOOF FROM CREATURES SAT ABSORBED ALONE
IMMACULATE IN TRANQUIL HEIGHTS OF SELF
ON CONCENTRATION'S LUMINOUS VOICELESS PEAKS
WORLD-NAKED HERMITS WITH THEIR MATTED HAIR
IMMOBILE AS THE PASSIONLESS GREAT HILLS
AROUND THEM GROUPED LIKE THOUGHTS OF SOME VAST MOOD
AWAITING THE INFINITE'S BEHEST TO END
THE SEERS ATTUNED TO THE UNIVERSAL WILL
CONTENT IN HIM WHO SMILES BEHIND EARTH'S FORMS
ABODE UNGRIEVED BY THE INSISTENT DAYS
ABOUT THEM LIKE GREEN TREES GIRDLING A HILL
YOUNG GRAVE DISCIPLES FASHIONED BY THEIR TOUCH
TRAINED TO THE SIMPLE ACT AND CONSCIOUS WORD
GREATENED WITHIN AND GREW TO MEET THEIR HEIGHTS
FAR-WANDERING SEEKERS ON THE ETERNAL'S PATH
BROUGHT TO THESE QUIET FOUNTS THEIR SPIRIT'S THIRST
AND SPENT THE TREASURE OF A SILENT HOUR
BATHED IN THE PURITY OF THE MILD GAZE
THAT UNINSISTENT RULED THEM FROM ITS PEACE
AND BY ITS INFLUENCE FOUND THE WAYS OF CALM
THE INFANTS OF THE MONARCHY OF THE WORLDS
THE HEROIC LEADERS OF A COMING TIME
KING-CHILDREN NURTURED IN THAT SPACIOUS AIR
LIKE LIONS GAMBOLLING IN SKY AND SUN
RECEIVED HALF-CONSCIOUSLY THEIR GODLIKE STAMP
FORMED IN THE TYPE OF THE HIGH THOUGHTS THEY SANG
THEY LEARNED THE WIDE MAGNIFICENCE OF MOOD
THAT MAKES US COMRADES OF THE COSMIC URGE
NO LONGER CHAINED TO THEIR SMALL SEPARATE SELVES
383
PLASTIC AND FIRM BENEATH THE ETERNAL HAND
MET NATURE WITH A BOLD AND FRIENDLY CLASP
AND SERVED IN HER THE POWER THAT SHAPES HER WORKS
ONE-SOULED TO ALL AND FREE FROM NARROWING BONDS
LARGE LIKE A CONTINENT OF WARM SUNSHINE
IN WIDE EQUALITY'S IMPARTIAL JOY
THESE SAGES BREATHED FOR GOD'S DELIGHT IN THINGS
ASSISTING THE SLOW ENTRIES OF THE GODS
SOWING IN YOUNG MINDS IMMORTAL THOUGHTS THEY LIVED
TAUGHT THE GREAT TRUTH TO WHICH MAN'S RACE MUST RISE
OR OPENED THE GATES OF FREEDOM TO A FEW
IMPARTING TO OUR STRUGGLING WORLD THE LIGHT
THEY BREATHED LIKE SPIRITS FROM TIME'S DULL YOKE RELEASED
COMRADES AND VESSELS OF THE COSMIC FORCE
USING A NATURAL MASTERY LIKE THE SUN'S
THEIR SPEECH THEIR SILENCE WAS A HELP TO EARTH
A MAGIC HAPPINESS FLOWED FROM THEIR TOUCH
ONENESS WAS SOVEREIGN IN THAT SYLVAN PEACE
THE WILD BEAST JOINED IN FRIENDSHIP WITH ITS PREY
PERSUADING THE HATRED AND THE STRIFE TO CEASE
THE LOVE THAT FLOWS FROM THE ONE MOTHER'S BREAST
HEALED WITH THEIR HEARTS THE HARD AND WOUNDED WORLD
OTHERS ESCAPED FROM THE CONFINES OF THOUGHT
TO WHERE MIND MOTIONLESS SLEEPS WAITING LIGHT'S BIRTH
AND CAME BACK QUIVERING WITH A NAMELESS FORCE
DRUNK WITH A WINE OF LIGHTNING IN THEIR CELLS
INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE LEAPING INTO SPEECH
SEIZED VIBRANT KINDLING WITH THE INSPIRED WORD
HEARING THE SUBTLE VOICE THAT CLOTHES THE HEAVENS
CARRYING THE SPLENDOUR THAT HAS LIT THE SUNS
THEY SANG INFINITY'S NAMES AND DEATHLESS POWERS
IN METRES THAT REFLECT THE MOVING WORLDS
SIGHT'S SOUND-WAVES BREAKING FROM THE SOUL'S GREAT DEEPS
SOME LOST TO THE PERSON AND HIS STRIP OF THOUGHT
IN A MOTIONLESS OCEAN OF IMPERSONAL POWER
SAT MIGHTY VISIONED WITH THE INFINITE'S LIGHT
384
OR COMRADES OF THE EVERLASTING WILL
SURVEYED THE PLAN OF PAST AND FUTURE TIME
SOME WINGED LIKE BIRDS OUT OF THE COSMIC SEA
AND VANISHED INTO A BRIGHT AND FEATURELESS VAST
SOME SILENT WATCHED THE UNIVERSAL DANCE
OR HELPED THE WORLD BY WORLD-INDIFFERENCE
SOME WATCHED NO MORE MERGED IN A LONELY SELF
ABSORBED IN THE TRANCE FROM WHICH NO SOUL RETURNS
ALL THE OCCULT WORLD-LINES FOR EVER CLOSED
THE CHAINS OF BIRTH AND PERSON CAST AWAY
SOME UNCOMPANIONED REACHED THE INEFFABLE
AS FLOATS A SUNBEAM THROUGH A SHADY PLACE
THE GOLDEN VIRGIN IN HER CARVEN CAR
CAME GLIDING AMONG MEDITATION'S SEATS
OFTEN IN TWILIGHT MID RETURNING TROOPS
OF CATTLE THICKENING WITH THEIR DUST THE SHADES
WHEN THE LOUD DAY HAD SLIPPED BELOW THE VERGE
ARRIVING IN A PEACEFUL HERMIT GROVE
SHE RESTED DRAWING ROUND HER LIKE A CLOAK
ITS SPIRIT OF PATIENT MUSE AND POTENT PRAYER
OR NEAR TO A LION RIVER'S TAWNY MANE
AND TREES THAT WORSHIPPED ON A PRAYING SHORE
A DOMED AND TEMPLED AIR'S SERENE REPOSE
BECKONED TO HER HURRYING WHEELS TO STAY THEIR SPEED
IN THE SOLEMNITY OF A SPACE THAT SEEMED
A MIND REMEMBERING ANCIENT SILENCES
WHERE TO THE HEART GREAT BYGONE VOICES CALLED
AND THE LARGE LIBERTY OF BROODING SEERS
HAD LEFT THE LONG IMPRESS OF THEIR SOUL'S SCENE
AWAKE IN CANDID DAWN OR DARKNESS MOONED
TO THE STILL TOUCH INCLINED THE DAUGHTER OF FLAME
DRANK IN HUSHED SPLENDOUR BETWEEN TRANQUIL LIDS
AND FELT THE KINSHIP OF ETERNAL CALM
BUT MORN BROKE IN REMINDING HER OF HER QUEST
AND FROM LOW RUSTIC COUCH OR MAT SHE ROSE
385
AND WENT IMPELLED ON HER UNFINISHED WAY
AND FOLLOWED THE FATEFUL ORBIT OF HER LIFE
LIKE A DESIRE THAT QUESTIONS SILENT GODS
THEN PASSES STARLIKE TO SOME BRIGHT BEYOND
THENCE TO GREAT SOLITARY TRACTS SHE CAME
WHERE MAN WAS A PASSER-BY TOWARDS HUMAN SCENES
OR SOLE IN NATURE'S VASTNESS STROVE TO LIVE
AND CALLED FOR HELP TO ENSOULED INVISIBLE POWERS
OVERWHELMED BY THE IMMENSITY OF HIS WORLD
AND UNAWARE OF HIS OWN INFINITY
THE EARTH MULTIPLIED TO HER A CHANGING BROW
AND CALLED HER WITH A FAR AND NAMELESS VOICE
THE MOUNTAINS IN THEIR ANCHORITE SOLITUDE
THE FORESTS WITH THEIR MULTITUDINOUS CHANT
DISCLOSED TO HER THE MASKED DIVINITY'S DOORS
ON DREAMING PLAINS AN INDOLENT EXPANSE
THE DEATH-BED OF A PALE ENCHANTED EVE
UNDER THE GLAMOUR OF A SUNKEN SKY
IMPASSIVE SHE LAY AS AT AN AGE'S END
OR CROSSED AN EAGER PACK OF HUDDLED HILLS
LIFTING THEIR HEADS TO HUNT A LAIRLIKE SKY
OR TRAVELLED IN A STRANGE AND EMPTY LAND
WHERE DESOLATE SUMMITS CAMPED IN A WEIRD HEAVEN
MUTE SENTINELS BENEATH A DRIFTING MOON
OR WANDERED IN SOME LONE TREMENDOUS WOOD
RINGING FOR EVER WITH THE CRICKETS' CRY
OR FOLLOWED A LONG GLISTENING SERPENT ROAD
THROUGH FIELDS AND PASTURES LAPPED IN MOVELESS LIGHT
OR REACHED THE WILD BEAUTY OF A DESERT SPACE
WHERE NEVER PLOUGH WAS DRIVEN NOR HERD HAD GRAZED
AND SLUMBERED UPON STRIPPED AND THIRSTY SANDS
AMID THE SAVAGE WILD-BEAST NIGHT'S APPEAL
STILL UNACCOMPLISHED WAS THE FATEFUL QUEST
STILL SHE FOUND NOT THE ONE PREDESTINED FACE
FOR WHICH SHE SOUGHT AMID THE SONS OF MEN
A GRANDIOSE SILENCE WRAPPED THE REGAL DAY
386
THE MONTHS HAD FED THE PASSION OF THE SUN
AND NOW HIS BURNING BREATH ASSAILED THE SOIL
THE TIGER HEATS PROWLED THROUGH THE FAINTING EARTH
ALL WAS LICKED UP AS BY A LOLLING TONGUE
THE SPRING WINDS FAILED THE SKY WAS SET LIKE BRONZE
389
BUT NOW THE DESTINED SPOT AND HOUR WERE CLOSE
UNKNOWING SHE HAD NEARED HER NAMELESS GOAL
FOR THOUGH A DRESS OF BLIND AND DEVIOUS CHANCE
IS LAID UPON THE WORK OF ALL-WISE FATE
OUR ACTS INTERPRET AN OMNISCIENT FORCE
THAT DWELLS IN THE COMPELLING STUFF OF THINGS
AND NOTHING HAPPENS IN THE COSMIC PLAY
BUT AT ITS TIME AND IN ITS FORESEEN PLACE
TO A SPACE SHE CAME OF SOFT AND DELICATE AIR
THAT SEEMED A SANCTUARY OF YOUTH AND JOY
A HIGHLAND WORLD OF FREE AND GREEN DELIGHT
WHERE SPRING AND SUMMER LAY TOGETHER AND STROVE
IN INDOLENT AND AMICABLE DEBATE
INARMED DISPUTING WITH LAUGHTER WHO SHOULD RULE
THERE EXPECTATION BEAT WIDE SUDDEN WINGS
AS IF A SOUL HAD LOOKED OUT FROM EARTH'S FACE
AND ALL THAT WAS IN HER FELT A COMING CHANGE
AND FORGETTING OBVIOUS JOYS AND COMMON DREAMS
OBEDIENT TO TIME'S CALL TO THE SPIRIT'S FATE
WAS LIFTED TO A BEAUTY CALM AND PURE
THAT LIVED UNDER THE EYES OF ETERNITY
A CROWD OF MOUNTAINOUS HEADS ASSAILED THE SKY
PUSHING TOWARDS RIVAL SHOULDERS NEARER HEAVEN
THE ARMOURED LEADERS OF AN IRON LINE
EARTH PROSTRATE LAY BENEATH THEIR FEET OF STONE
BELOW THEM CROUCHED A DREAM OF EMERALD WOODS
AND GLEAMING BORDERS SOLITARY AS SLEEP
PALE WATERS RAN LIKE GLIMMERING THREADS OF PEARL
A SIGH WAS STRAYING AMONG HAPPY LEAVES
COOL-PERFUMED WITH SLOW PLEASURE-BURDENED FEET
FAINT STUMBLING BREEZES FALTERED AMONG FLOWERS
390
THE WHITE CRANE STOOD A VIVID MOTIONLESS STREAK
PEACOCK AND PARROT JEWELLED SOIL AND TREE
THE DOVE'S SOFT MOAN ENRICHED THE ENAMOURED AIR
AND FIRE-WINGED WILD-DRAKES SWAM IN SILVERY POOLS
EARTH COUCHED ALONE WITH HER GREAT LOVER HEAVEN
UNCOVERED TO HER CONSORT'S AZURE EYE
IN A LUXURIOUS ECSTASY OF JOY
SHE SQUANDERED THE LOVE-MUSIC OF HER NOTES
WASTING THE PASSIONATE PATTERN OF HER BLOOMS
AND FESTIVAL RIOT OF HER SCENTS AND HUES
A CRY AND LEAP AND HURRY WAS AROUND
THE STEALTHY FOOTFALLS OF HER CHASING THINGS
THE SHAGGY EMERALD OF HER CENTAUR MANE
THE GOLD AND SAPPHIRE OF HER WARMTH AND BLAZE
MAGICIAN OF HER RAPT FELICITIES
BLITHE SENSUOUS-HEARTED CARELESS AND DIVINE
LIFE RAN OR HID IN HER DELIGHTFUL ROOMS
BEHIND ALL BROODED NATURE'S GRANDIOSE CALM
PRIMAEVAL PEACE WAS THERE AND IN ITS BOSOM
HELD UNDISTURBED THE STRIFE OF BIRD AND BEAST
MAN THE DEEP-BROWED ARTIFICER HAD NOT COME
TO LAY HIS HAND ON HAPPY INCONSCIENT THINGS
THOUGHT WAS NOT THERE NOR THE MEASURER STRONG-EYED TOIL
LIFE HAD NOT LEARNED ITS DISCORD WITH ITS AIM
THE MIGHTY MOTHER LAY OUTSTRETCHED AT EASE
ALL WAS IN LINE WITH HER FIRST SATISFIED PLAN
MOVED BY A UNIVERSAL WILL OF JOY
THE TREES BLOOMED IN THEIR GREEN FELICITY
AND THE WILD CHILDREN BROODED NOT ON PAIN
AT THE END RECLINED A STERN AND GIANT TRACT
OF TANGLED DEPTHS AND SOLEMN QUESTIONING HILLS
PEAKS LIKE A BARE AUSTERITY OF THE SOUL
ARMOURED REMOTE AND DESOLATELY GRAND
LIKE THE THOUGHT-SCREENED INFINITIES THAT LIE
BEHIND THE RAPT SMILE OF THE ALMIGHTY'S DANCE
A MATTED FOREST-HEAD INVADED HEAVEN
391
AS IF A BLUE-THROATED ASCETIC PEERED
FROM THE STONE FASTNESS OF HIS MOUNTAIN CELL
REGARDING THE BRIEF GLADNESS OF THE DAYS
HIS VAST EXTENDED SPIRIT COUCHED BEHIND
A MIGHTY MURMUR OF IMMENSE RETREAT
BESIEGED THE EAR A SAD AND LIMITLESS CALL
AS OF A SOUL RETIRING FROM THE WORLD
THIS WAS THE SCENE WHICH THE AMBIGUOUS MOTHER
HAD CHOSEN FOR HER BRIEF FELICITOUS HOUR
HERE IN THIS SOLITUDE FAR FROM THE WORLD
HER PART SHE BEGAN IN THE WORLD'S JOY AND STRIFE
HERE WERE DISCLOSED TO HER THE MYSTIC COURTS
THE LURKING DOORS OF BEAUTY AND SURPRISE
THE WINGS THAT MURMUR IN THE GOLDEN HOUSE
THE TEMPLE OF SWEETNESS AND THE FIERY AISLE
A STRANGER ON THE SORROWFUL ROADS OF TIME
IMMORTAL UNDER THE YOKE OF DEATH AND FATE
A SACRIFICANT OF THE BLISS AND PAIN OF THE SPHERES
LOVE IN THE WILDERNESS MET SAVITRI
392
ALL SHE REMEMBERED ON THIS DAY OF FATE
THE ROAD THAT HAZARDED NOT THE SOLEMN DEPTHS
BUT TURNED AWAY TO FLEE TO HUMAN HOMES
THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS MIGHTY MONOTONE
THE MORNING LIKE A LUSTROUS SEER ABOVE
THE PASSION OF THE SUMMITS LOST IN HEAVEN
THE TITAN MURMUR OF THE ENDLESS WOODS
AS IF A WICKET GATE TO JOY WERE THERE
RINGED IN WITH VOICELESS HINT AND MAGIC SIGN
UPON THE MARGIN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD
RECLINED THE CURVE OF A SUN-HELD RECESS
GROVES WITH STRANGE FLOWERS LIKE EYES OF GAZING NYMPHS
PEERED FROM THEIR SECRECY INTO OPEN SPACE
BOUGHS WHISPERING TO A CONSTANCY OF LIGHT
SHELTERED A DIM AND SCREENED FELICITY
AND SLOWLY A SUPINE INCONSTANT BREEZE
RAN LIKE A FLEETING SIGH OF HAPPINESS
OVER SLUMBROUS GRASSES PRANKED WITH GREEN AND GOLD
HIDDEN IN THE FOREST'S BOSOM OF LONELINESS
AMID THE LEAVES THE INMATE VOICES CALLED
SWEET LIKE DESIRES ENAMOURED AND UNSEEN
CRY ANSWERING TO LOW INSISTENT CRY
BEHIND SLEPT EMERALD DUMB REMOTENESSES
HAUNT OF A NATURE PASSIONATE VEILED DENIED
TO ALL BUT HER OWN VISION LOST AND WILD
EARTH IN THIS BEAUTIFUL REFUGE FREE FROM CARES
MURMURED TO THE SOUL A SONG OF STRENGTH AND PEACE
ONLY ONE SIGN WAS THERE OF A HUMAN TREAD
A SINGLE PATH SHOT THIN AND ARROWLIKE
INTO THIS BOSOM OF VAST AND SECRET LIFE
PIERCED ITS ENORMOUS DREAM OF SOLITUDE
393
HERE FIRST SHE MET ON THE UNCERTAIN EARTH
THE ONE FOR WHOM HER HEART HAD COME SO FAR
AS MIGHT A SOUL ON NATURE'S BACKGROUND LIMNED
STAND OUT FOR A MOMENT IN A HOUSE OF DREAM
CREATED BY THE ARDENT BREATH OF LIFE
SO HE APPEARED AGAINST THE FOREST VERGE
INSET TWIXT GREEN RELIEF AND GOLDEN RAY
AS IF A WEAPON OF THE LIVING LIGHT
ERECT AND LOFTY LIKE A SPEAR OF GOD
HIS FIGURE LED THE SPLENDOUR OF THE MORN
NOBLE AND CLEAR AS THE BROAD PEACEFUL HEAVENS
A TABLET OF YOUNG WISDOM WAS HIS BROW
FREEDOM'S IMPERIOUS BEAUTY CURVED HIS LIMBS
THE JOY OF LIFE WAS ON HIS OPEN FACE
HIS LOOK WAS A WIDE DAYBREAK OF THE GODS
HIS HEAD WAS A YOUTHFUL RISHI'S TOUCHED WITH LIGHT
HIS BODY WAS A LOVER'S AND A KING'S
IN THE MAGNIFICENT DAWNING OF HIS FORCE
BUILT LIKE A MOVING STATUE OF DELIGHT
HE ILLUMINED THE BORDER OF THE FOREST PAGE
OUT OF THE IGNORANT EAGER TOIL OF THE YEARS
ABANDONING MAN'S LOUD DRAMA HE HAD COME
LED BY THE WISDOM OF AN ADVERSE FATE
TO MEET THE ANCIENT MOTHER IN HER GROVES
IN HER DIVINE COMMUNION HE HAD GROWN
A FOSTER-CHILD OF BEAUTY AND SOLITUDE
HEIR TO THE CENTURIES OF THE LONELY WISE
A BROTHER OF THE SUNSHINE AND THE SKY
A WANDERER COMMUNING WITH DEPTH AND MARGE
A VEDA-KNOWER OF THE UNWRITTEN BOOK
PERUSING THE MYSTIC SCRIPTURE OF HER FORMS
HE HAD CAUGHT HER HIEROPHANT SIGNIFICANCES
HER SPHERED IMMENSE IMAGINATIONS LEARNED
TAUGHT BY SUBLIMITIES OF STREAM AND WOOD
AND VOICES OF THE SUN AND STAR AND FLAME
AND CHANT OF THE MAGIC SINGERS ON THE BOUGHS
394
AND THE DUMB TEACHING OF FOUR-FOOTED THINGS
HELPING WITH CONFIDENT STEPS HER SLOW GREAT HANDS
HE LEANED TO HER INFLUENCE LIKE A FLOWER TO RAIN
AND LIKE THE FLOWER AND TREE A NATURAL GROWTH
WIDENED WITH THE TOUCHES OF HER SHAPING HOURS
THE MASTERY FREE NATURES HAVE WAS HIS
AND THEIR ASSENT TO JOY AND SPACIOUS CALM
ONE WITH THE SINGLE SPIRIT INHABITING ALL
HE LAID EXPERIENCE AT THE GODHEAD'S FEET
HIS MIND WAS OPEN TO HER INFINITE MIND
HIS ACTS WERE RHYTHMIC WITH HER PRIMAL FORCE
HE HAD SUBDUED HIS MORTAL THOUGHT TO HERS
THAT DAY HE HAD TURNED FROM HIS ACCUSTOMED PATHS
FOR ONE WHO KNOWING EVERY MOMENT'S LOAD
CAN MOVE IN ALL OUR STUDIED OR CARELESS STEPS
HAD LAID THE SPELL OF DESTINY ON HIS FEET
AND DRAWN HIM TO THE FOREST'S FLOWERING VERGE
AT FIRST HER GLANCE THAT TOOK LIFE'S MILLION SHAPES
IMPARTIALLY TO PEOPLE ITS TREASURE-HOUSE
ALONG WITH SKY AND FLOWER AND HILL AND STAR
DWELT RATHER ON THE BRIGHT HARMONIOUS SCENE
IT SAW THE GREEN-GOLD OF THE SLUMBROUS SWARD
THE GRASSES QUIVERING WITH THE SLOW WIND'S TREAD
THE BRANCHES HAUNTED BY THE WILD BIRD'S CALL
AWAKE TO NATURE VAGUE AS YET TO LIFE
THE EAGER PRISONER FROM THE INFINITE
THE IMMORTAL WRESTLER IN ITS MORTAL HOUSE
ITS PRIDE POWER PASSION OF A STRIVING GOD
IT SAW THIS IMAGE OF VEILED DEITY
THIS THINKING MASTER CREATURE OF THE EARTH
THIS LAST RESULT OF THE BEAUTY OF THE STARS
BUT ONLY SAW LIKE FAIR AND COMMON FORMS
THE ARTIST SPIRIT NEEDS NOT FOR ITS WORK
AND PUTS ASIDE IN MEMORY'S SHADOWY ROOMS
A LOOK A TURN DECIDES OUR ILL-POISED FATE
THUS IN THE HOUR THAT MOST CONCERNED HER ALL
395
WANDERING UNWARNED BY THE SLOW SURFACE MIND
THE HEEDLESS SCOUT BENEATH HER TENTING LIDS
ADMIRED INDIFFERENT BEAUTY AND CARED NOT
TO WAKE HER BODY'S SPIRIT TO ITS KING
SO MIGHT SHE HAVE PASSED BY ON CHANCE IGNORANT ROADS
MISSING THE CALL OF HEAVEN LOSING LIFE'S AIM
BUT THE GOD TOUCHED IN TIME HER CONSCIOUS SOUL
HER VISION SETTLED CAUGHT AND ALL WAS CHANGED
HER MIND AT FIRST DWELT IN IDEAL DREAMS
THOSE INTIMATE TRANSMUTERS OF EARTH'S SIGNS
THAT MAKE KNOWN THINGS A HINT OF UNSEEN SPHERES
AND SAW IN HIM THE GENIUS OF THE SPOT
A SYMBOL FIGURE STANDING MID EARTH'S SCENES
A KING OF LIFE OUTLINED IN DELICATE AIR
YET THIS WAS BUT A MOMENT'S REVERIE
FOR SUDDENLY HER HEART LOOKED OUT AT HIM
THE PASSIONATE SEEING USED THOUGHT CANNOT MATCH
AND KNEW ONE NEARER THAN ITS OWN CLOSE STRINGS
ALL IN A MOMENT WAS SURPRISED AND SEIZED
ALL IN INCONSCIENT ECSTASY LAIN WRAPPED
OR UNDER IMAGINATION'S COLOURED LIDS
HELD UP IN A LARGE MIRROR-AIR OF DREAM
BROKE FORTH IN FLAME TO RECREATE THE WORLD
AND IN THAT FLAME TO NEW THINGS SHE WAS BORN
A MYSTIC TUMULT FROM HER DEPTHS AROSE
HALED SMITTEN ERECT LIKE ONE WHO DREAMED AT EASE
LIFE RAN TO GAZE FROM EVERY GATE OF SENSE
THOUGHTS INDISTINCT AND GLAD IN MOON-MIST HEAVENS
FEELINGS AS WHEN A UNIVERSE TAKES BIRTH
SWEPT THROUGH THE TURMOIL OF HER BOSOM'S SPACE
INVADED BY A SWARM OF GOLDEN GODS
ARISING TO A HYMN OF WONDER'S PRIESTS
HER SOUL FLUNG WIDE ITS DOORS TO THIS NEW SUN
AN ALCHEMY WORKED THE TRANSMUTATION CAME
THE MISSIONED FACE HAD WROUGHT THE MASTER'S SPELL
IN THE NAMELESS LIGHT OF TWO APPROACHING EYES
396
A SWIFT AND FATED TURNING OF HER DAYS
APPEARED AND STRETCHED TO A GLEAM OF UNKNOWN WORLDS
THEN TREMBLING WITH THE MYSTIC SHOCK HER HEART
MOVED IN HER BREAST AND CRIED OUT LIKE A BIRD
WHO HEARS HIS MATE UPON A NEIGHBOURING BOUGH
HOOVES TRAMPLING FAST WHEELS LARGELY STUMBLING CEASED
THE CHARIOT STOOD LIKE AN ARRESTED WIND
AND SATYAVAN LOOKED OUT FROM HIS SOUL'S DOORS
AND FELT THE ENCHANTMENT OF HER LIQUID VOICE
FILL HIS YOUTH'S PURPLE AMBIENCE AND ENDURED
THE HAUNTING MIRACLE OF A PERFECT FACE
MASTERED BY THE HONEY OF A STRANGE FLOWER-MOUTH
DRAWN TO SOUL-SPACES OPENING ROUND A BROW
HE TURNED TO THE VISION LIKE A SEA TO THE MOON
AND SUFFERED A DREAM OF BEAUTY AND OF CHANGE
DISCOVERED THE AUREOLE ROUND A MORTAL'S HEAD
ADORED A NEW DIVINITY IN THINGS
HIS SELF-BOUND NATURE FOUNDERED AS IN FIRE
HIS LIFE WAS TAKEN INTO ANOTHER'S LIFE
THE SPLENDID LONELY IDOLS OF HIS BRAIN
FELL PROSTRATE FROM THEIR BRIGHT SUFFICIENCIES
AS AT THE TOUCH OF A NEW INFINITE
TO WORSHIP A GODHEAD GREATER THAN THEIR OWN
AN UNKNOWN IMPERIOUS FORCE DREW HIM TO HER
MARVELLING HE CAME ACROSS THE GOLDEN SWARD
GAZE MET CLOSE GAZE AND CLUNG IN SIGHT'S EMBRACE
A VISAGE WAS THERE NOBLE AND GREAT AND CALM
AS IF ENCIRCLED BY A HALO OF THOUGHT
A SPAN AN ARCH OF MEDITATING LIGHT
AS THOUGH SOME SECRET NIMBUS HALF WAS SEEN
HER INNER VISION STILL REMEMBERING KNEW
A FOREHEAD THAT WORE THE CROWN OF ALL HER PAST
TWO EYES HER CONSTANT AND ETERNAL STARS
COMRADE AND SOVEREIGN EYES THAT CLAIMED HER SOUL
LIDS KNOWN THROUGH MANY LIVES LARGE FRAMES OF LOVE
HE MET IN HER REGARD HIS FUTURE'S GAZE
397
A PROMISE AND A PRESENCE AND A FIRE
SAW AN EMBODIMENT OF AEONIC DREAMS
A MYSTERY OF THE RAPTURE FOR WHICH ALL
YEARNS IN THIS WORLD OF BRIEF MORTALITY
MADE IN MATERIAL SHAPE HIS VERY OWN
THIS GOLDEN FIGURE GIVEN TO HIS GRASP
HID IN ITS BREAST THE KEY OF ALL HIS AIMS
A SPELL TO BRING THE IMMORTAL'S BLISS ON EARTH
TO MATE WITH HEAVEN'S TRUTH OUR MORTAL THOUGHT
TO LIFT EARTH-HEARTS NEARER THE ETERNAL'S SUN
IN THESE GREAT SPIRITS NOW INCARNATE HERE
LOVE BROUGHT DOWN POWER OUT OF ETERNITY
TO MAKE OF LIFE HIS NEW UNDYING BASE
HIS PASSION SURGED A WAVE FROM FATHOMLESS DEEPS
IT LEAPED TO EARTH FROM FAR FORGOTTEN HEIGHTS
BUT KEPT ITS NATURE OF INFINITY
ON THE DUMB BOSOM OF THIS OBLIVIOUS GLOBE
ALTHOUGH AS UNKNOWN BEINGS WE SEEM TO MEET
OUR LIVES ARE NOT ALIENS NOR AS STRANGERS JOIN
MOVED TO EACH OTHER BY A CAUSELESS FORCE
THE SOUL CAN RECOGNISE ITS ANSWERING SOUL
ACROSS DIVIDING TIME AND ON LIFE'S ROADS
ABSORBED WRAPPED TRAVELLER TURNING IT RECOVERS
FAMILIAR SPLENDOURS IN AN UNKNOWN FACE
AND TOUCHED BY THE WARNING FINGER OF SWIFT LOVE
IT THRILLS AGAIN TO AN IMMORTAL JOY
WEARING A MORTAL BODY FOR DELIGHT
THERE IS A POWER WITHIN THAT KNOWS BEYOND
OUR KNOWINGS WE ARE GREATER THAN OUR THOUGHTS
AND SOMETIMES EARTH UNVEILS THAT VISION HERE
TO LIVE TO LOVE ARE SIGNS OF INFINITE THINGS
LOVE IS A GLORY FROM ETERNITY'S SPHERES
ABASED DISFIGURED MOCKED BY BASER MIGHTS
THAT STEAL HIS NAME AND SHAPE AND ECSTASY
HE IS STILL THE GODHEAD BY WHICH ALL CAN CHANGE
A MYSTERY WAKES IN OUR INCONSCIENT STUFF
398
A BLISS IS BORN THAT CAN REMAKE OUR LIFE
LOVE DWELLS IN US LIKE AN UNOPENED FLOWER
AWAITING A RAPID MOMENT OF THE SOUL
OR HE ROAMS IN HIS CHARMED SLEEP MID THOUGHTS AND THINGS
THE CHILD-GOD IS AT PLAY HE SEEKS HIMSELF
IN MANY HEARTS AND MINDS AND LIVING FORMS
HE LINGERS FOR A SIGN THAT HE CAN KNOW
AND WHEN IT COMES WAKES BLINDLY TO A VOICE
A LOOK A TOUCH THE MEANING OF A FACE
HIS INSTRUMENT THE DIM CORPOREAL MIND
OF CELESTIAL INSIGHT NOW FORGETFUL GROWN
HE SEIZES ON SOME SIGN OF OUTWARD CHARM
TO GUIDE HIM MID THE THRONG OF NATURE'S HINTS
READS HEAVENLY TRUTHS INTO EARTH'S SEMBLANCES
DESIRES THE IMAGE FOR THE GODHEAD'S SAKE
DIVINES THE IMMORTALITIES OF FORM
AND TAKES THE BODY FOR THE SCULPTURED SOUL
LOVE'S ADORATION LIKE A MYSTIC SEER
THROUGH VISION LOOKS AT THE INVISIBLE
IN EARTH'S ALPHABET FINDS A GODLIKE SENSE
BUT THE MIND ONLY THINKS BEHOLD THE ONE
FOR WHOM MY LIFE HAS WAITED LONG UNFILLED
BEHOLD THE SUDDEN SOVEREIGN OF MY DAYS
HEART FEELS FOR HEART LIMB CRIES FOR ANSWERING LIMB
ALL STRIVES TO ENFORCE THE UNITY ALL IS
TOO FAR FROM THE DIVINE LOVE SEEKS HIS TRUTH
AND LIFE IS BLIND AND THE INSTRUMENTS DECEIVE
AND POWERS ARE THERE THAT LABOUR TO DEBASE
STILL CAN THE VISION COME THE JOY ARRIVE
RARE IS THE CUP FIT FOR LOVE'S NECTAR WINE
AS RARE THE VESSEL THAT CAN HOLD GOD'S BIRTH
A SOUL MADE READY THROUGH A THOUSAND YEARS
IS THE LIVING MOULD OF A SUPREME DESCENT
THESE KNEW EACH OTHER THOUGH IN FORMS THUS STRANGE
ALTHOUGH TO SIGHT UNKNOWN THOUGH LIFE AND MIND
HAD ALTERED TO HOLD A NEW SIGNIFICANCE
399
THESE BODIES SUMMED THE DRIFT OF NUMBERLESS BIRTHS
AND THE SPIRIT TO THE SPIRIT WAS THE SAME
AMAZED BY A JOY FOR WHICH THEY HAD WAITED LONG
THE LOVERS MET UPON THEIR DIFFERENT PATHS
TRAVELLERS ACROSS THE LIMITLESS PLAINS OF TIME
TOGETHER DRAWN FROM FATE-LED JOURNEYINGS
IN THE SELF-CLOSED SOLITUDE OF THEIR HUMAN PAST
TO A SWIFT RAPTUROUS DREAM OF FUTURE JOY
AND THE UNEXPECTED PRESENT OF THESE EYES
BY THE REVEALING GREATNESS OF A LOOK
FORM-SMITTEN THE SPIRIT'S MEMORY WOKE IN SENSE
THE MIST WAS TORN THAT LAY BETWEEN TWO LIVES
HER HEART UNVEILED AND HIS TO FIND HER TURNED
ATTRACTED AS IN HEAVEN STAR BY STAR
THEY WONDERED AT EACH OTHER AND REJOICED
AND WOVE AFFINITY IN A SILENT GAZE
A MOMENT PASSED THAT WAS ETERNITY'S RAY
AN HOUR BEGAN THE MATRIX OF NEW TIME
400
OUT OF THE VOICELESS MYSTERY OF THE PAST
IN A PRESENT IGNORANT OF FORGOTTEN BONDS
THESE SPIRITS MET UPON THE ROADS OF TIME
YET IN THE HEART THEIR SECRET CONSCIOUS SELVES
AT ONCE AWARE GREW OF EACH OTHER WARNED
BY THE FIRST CALL OF A DELIGHTFUL VOICE
AND A FIRST VISION OF THE DESTINED FACE
AS WHEN BEING CRIES TO BEING FROM ITS DEPTHS
BEHIND THE SCREEN OF THE EXTERNAL SENSE
AND STRIVES TO FIND THE HEART-DISCLOSING WORD
THE PASSIONATE SPEECH REVEALING THE SOUL'S NEED
BUT THE MIND'S IGNORANCE VEILS THE INNER SIGHT
ONLY A LITTLE BREAKS THROUGH OUR EARTH-MADE BOUNDS
SO NOW THEY MET IN THAT MOMENTOUS HOUR
SO UTTER THE RECOGNITION IN THE DEEPS
THE REMEMBRANCE LOST THE ONENESS FELT AND MISSED
THUS SATYAVAN SPOKE FIRST TO SAVITRI
O THOU WHO COM'ST TO ME OUT OF TIME'S SILENCES
YET THY VOICE HAS WAKENED MY HEART TO AN UNKNOWN BLISS
IMMORTAL OR MORTAL ONLY IN THY FRAME
FOR MORE THAN EARTH SPEAKS TO ME FROM THY SOUL
AND MORE THAN EARTH SURROUNDS ME IN THY GAZE
HOW ART THOU NAMED AMONG THE SONS OF MEN
WHENCE HAST THOU DAWNED FILLING MY SPIRIT'S DAYS
BRIGHTER THAN SUMMER BRIGHTER THAN MY FLOWERS
INTO THE LONELY BORDERS OF MY LIFE
O SUNLIGHT MOULDED LIKE A GOLDEN MAID
I KNOW THAT MIGHTY GODS ARE FRIENDS OF EARTH
AMID THE PAGEANTRIES OF DAY AND DUSK
LONG HAVE I TRAVELLED WITH MY PILGRIM SOUL
MOVED BY THE MARVEL OF FAMILIAR THINGS
401
EARTH COULD NOT HIDE FROM ME THE POWERS SHE VEILS
EVEN THOUGH MOVING MID AN EARTHLY SCENE
AND THE COMMON SURFACES OF TERRESTRIAL THINGS
MY VISION SAW UNBLINDED BY HER FORMS
THE GODHEAD LOOKED AT ME FROM FAMILIAR SCENES
I WITNESSED THE VIRGIN BRIDALS OF THE DAWN
BEHIND THE GLOWING CURTAINS OF THE SKY
OR VYING IN JOY WITH THE BRIGHT MORNING'S STEPS
I PACED ALONG THE SLUMBROUS COASTS OF NOON
OR THE GOLD DESERT OF THE SUNLIGHT CROSSED
TRAVERSING GREAT WASTES OF SPLENDOUR AND OF FIRE
OR MET THE MOON GLIDING AMAZED THROUGH HEAVEN
IN THE UNCERTAIN WIDENESS OF THE NIGHT
OR THE STARS MARCHED ON THEIR LONG SENTINEL ROUTES
POINTING THEIR SPEARS THROUGH THE INFINITUDES
THE DAY AND DUSK REVEALED TO ME HIDDEN SHAPES
FIGURES HAVE COME TO ME FROM SECRET SHORES
AND HAPPY FACES LOOKED FROM RAY AND FLAME
I HAVE HEARD STRANGE VOICES CROSS THE ETHER'S WAVES
THE CENTAUR'S WIZARD SONG HAS THRILLED MY EAR
I HAVE GLIMPSED THE APSARAS BATHING IN THE POOLS
I HAVE SEEN THE WOOD-NYMPHS PEERING THROUGH THE LEAVES
THE WINDS HAVE SHOWN TO ME THEIR TRAMPLING LORDS
I HAVE BEHELD THE PRINCES OF THE SUN
BURNING IN THOUSAND-PILLARED HOMES OF LIGHT
SO NOW MY MIND COULD DREAM AND MY HEART FEAR
THAT FROM SOME WONDER-COUCH BEYOND OUR AIR
RISEN IN A WIDE MORNING OF THE GODS
THOU DROV'ST THY HORSES FROM THE THUNDERER'S WORLDS
ALTHOUGH TO HEAVEN THY BEAUTY SEEMS ALLIED
MUCH RATHER WOULD MY THOUGHTS REJOICE TO KNOW
THAT MORTAL SWEETNESS SMILES BETWEEN THY LIDS
AND THY HEART CAN BEAT BENEATH A HUMAN GAZE
AND THY AUREATE BOSOM QUIVER WITH A LOOK
AND ITS TUMULT ANSWER TO AN EARTH-BORN VOICE
IF OUR TIME-VEXED AFFECTIONS THOU CANST FEEL
402
EARTH'S EASE OF SIMPLE THINGS CAN SATISFY
IF THY GLANCE CAN DWELL CONTENT ON EARTHLY SOIL
AND THIS CELESTIAL SUMMARY OF DELIGHT
THY GOLDEN BODY DALLY WITH FATIGUE
OPPRESSING WITH ITS GRACE OUR TERRAIN WHILE
THE FRAIL SWEET PASSING TASTE OF EARTHLY FOOD
DELAYS THEE AND THE TORRENT'S LEAPING WINE
DESCEND LET THY JOURNEY CEASE COME DOWN TO US
CLOSE IS MY FATHER'S CREEPERED HERMITAGE
SCREENED BY THE TALL RANKS OF THESE SILENT KINGS
SUNG TO BY VOICES OF THE HUE-ROBED CHOIRS
WHOSE CHANTS REPEAT TRANSCRIBED IN MUSIC'S NOTES
THE PASSIONATE COLOURED LETTERING OF THE BOUGHS
AND FILL THE HOURS WITH THEIR MELODIOUS CRY
AMID THE WELCOME-HUM OF MANY BEES
INVADE OUR HONIED KINGDOM OF THE WOODS
THERE LET ME LEAD THEE INTO AN OPULENT LIFE
BARE SIMPLE IS THE SYLVAN HERMIT-LIFE
YET IS IT CLAD WITH THE JEWELRY OF EARTH
WILD WINDS RUN VISITORS MIDST THE SWAYING TOPS
THROUGH THE CALM DAYS HEAVEN'S SENTINELS OF PEACE
COUCHED ON A PURPLE ROBE OF SKY ABOVE
LOOK DOWN ON A RICH SECRECY AND HUSH
AND THE CHAMBERED NUPTIAL WATERS CHANT WITHIN
ENORMOUS WHISPERING MANY-FORMED AROUND
HIGH FOREST GODS HAVE TAKEN IN THEIR ARMS
THE HUMAN HOUR A GUEST OF THEIR CENTURIED POMPS
APPARELLED ARE THE MORNS IN GOLD AND GREEN
SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW TAPESTRY THE WALLS
TO MAKE A RESTING CHAMBER FIT FOR THEE
AWHILE SHE PAUSED AS IF HEARING STILL HIS VOICE
UNWILLING TO BREAK THE CHARM THEN SLOWLY SPOKE
MUSING SHE ANSWERED I AM SAVITRI
PRINCESS OF MADRA WHO ART THOU WHAT NAME
MUSICAL ON EARTH EXPRESSES THEE TO MEN
WHAT TRUNK OF KINGS WATERED BY FORTUNATE STREAMS
403
HAS FLOWERED AT LAST UPON ONE HAPPY BRANCH
WHY IS THY DWELLING IN THE PATHLESS WOOD
FAR FROM THE DEEDS THY GLORIOUS YOUTH DEMANDS
HAUNT OF THE ANCHORITES AND EARTH'S WILDER BROODS
WHERE ONLY WITH THY WITNESS SELF THOU ROAMST
IN NATURE'S GREEN UNHUMAN LONELINESS
SURROUNDED BY ENORMOUS SILENCES
AND THE BLIND MURMUR OF PRIMAEVAL CALMS
AND SATYAVAN REPLIED TO SAVITRI
IN DAYS WHEN YET HIS SIGHT LOOKED CLEAR ON LIFE
KING DYUMATSENA ONCE THE SHALWA REIGNED
THROUGH ALL THE TRACT WHICH FROM BEHIND THESE TOPS
PASSING ITS DAYS OF EMERALD DELIGHT
IN TRUSTING CONVERSE WITH THE TRAVELLER WINDS
TURNS LOOKING BACK TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN HEAVENS
AND LEANS ITS FLANK UPON THE MUSING HILLS
BUT EQUAL FATE REMOVED HER COVERING HAND
A LIVING NIGHT ENCLOSED THE STRONG MAN'S PATHS
HEAVEN'S BRILLIANT GODS RECALLED THEIR CARELESS GIFTS
TOOK FROM BLANK EYES THEIR GLAD AND HELPING RAY
AND LED THE UNCERTAIN GODDESS FROM HIS SIDE
OUTCAST FROM EMPIRE OF THE OUTER LIGHT
LOST TO THE COMRADESHIP OF SEEING MEN
HE SOJOURNS IN TWO SOLITUDES WITHIN
AND IN THE SOLEMN RUSTLE OF THE WOODS
SON OF THAT KING I SATYAVAN HAVE LIVED
CONTENTED FOR NOT YET OF THEE AWARE
IN MY HIGH-PEOPLED LONELINESS OF SPIRIT
AND THIS HUGE VITAL MURMUR KIN TO ME
NURSED BY THE VASTNESS PUPIL OF SOLITUDE
GREAT NATURE CAME TO HER RECOVERED CHILD
I REIGNED IN A KINGDOM OF A NOBLER KIND
THAN MEN CAN BUILD UPON DULL MATTER'S SOIL
I MET THE FRANKNESS OF THE PRIMAL EARTH
I ENJOYED THE INTIMACY OF INFANT GOD
IN THE GREAT TAPESTRIED CHAMBERS OF HER STATE
404
FREE IN HER BOUNDLESS PALACE I HAVE DWELT
INDULGED BY THE WARM MOTHER OF US ALL
REARED WITH MY NATURAL BROTHERS IN HER HOUSE
I LAY IN THE WIDE BARE EMBRACE OF HEAVEN
THE SUNLIGHT'S RADIANT BLESSING CLASPED MY BROW
THE MOONBEAMS' SILVER ECSTASY AT NIGHT
KISSED MY DIM LIDS TO SLEEP EARTH'S MORNS WERE MINE
LURED BY FAINT MURMURINGS WITH THE GREEN-ROBED HOURS
I WANDERED LOST IN WOODS PRONE TO THE VOICE
OF WINDS AND WATERS PARTNER OF THE SUN'S JOY
A LISTENER TO THE UNIVERSAL SPEECH
MY SPIRIT SATISFIED WITHIN ME KNEW
GODLIKE OUR BIRTHRIGHT LUXURIED OUR LIFE
WHOSE CLOSE BELONGINGS ARE THE EARTH AND SKIES
BEFORE FATE LED ME INTO THIS EMERALD WORLD
AROUSED BY SOME FORESHADOWING TOUCH WITHIN
AN EARLY PRESCIENCE IN MY MIND APPROACHED
THE GREAT DUMB ANIMAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF EARTH
NOW GROWN SO CLOSE TO ME WHO HAVE LEFT OLD POMPS
TO LIVE IN THIS GRANDIOSE MURMUR DIM AND VAST
ALREADY I MET HER IN MY SPIRIT'S DREAM
AS IF TO A DEEPER COUNTRY OF THE SOUL
TRANSPOSING THE VIVID IMAGERY OF EARTH
THROUGH AN INNER SEEING AND SENSE A WAKENING CAME
A VISIONED SPELL PURSUED MY BOYHOOD'S HOURS
ALL THINGS THE EYE HAD CAUGHT IN COLOURED LINES
WERE SEEN ANEW THROUGH THE INTERPRETING MIND
AND IN THE SHAPE IT SOUGHT TO SEIZE THE SOUL
AN EARLY CHILD-GOD TOOK MY HAND THAT HELD
MOVED GUIDED BY THE SEEKING OF HIS TOUCH
BRIGHT FORMS AND HUES WHICH FLED ACROSS HIS SIGHT
LIMNED UPON PAGE AND STONE THEY SPOKE TO MEN
HIGH BEAUTY'S VISITANTS MY INTIMATES WERE
THE NEIGHING PRIDE OF RAPID LIFE THAT ROAMS
WIND-MANED THROUGH OUR PASTURES ON MY SEEING MOOD
CAST SHAPES OF SWIFTNESS TROOPING SPOTTED DEER
405
AGAINST THE VESPER SKY BECAME A SONG
OF EVENING TO THE SILENCE OF MY SOUL
I CAUGHT FOR SOME ETERNAL EYE THE SUDDEN
KING-FISHER FLASHING TO A DARKLING POOL
A SLOW SWAN SILVERING THE AZURE LAKE
A SHAPE OF MAGIC WHITENESS SAILED THROUGH DREAM
LEAVES TREMBLING WITH THE PASSION OF THE WIND
PRANKED BUTTERFLIES THE CONSCIOUS FLOWERS OF AIR
AND WANDERING WINGS IN BLUE INFINITY
LIVED ON THE TABLETS OF MY INNER SIGHT
MOUNTAINS AND TREES STOOD THERE LIKE THOUGHTS FROM GOD
THE BRILLIANT LONG-BILLS IN THEIR VIVID DRESS
THE PEACOCK SCATTERING ON THE BREEZE HIS MOONS
PAINTED MY MEMORY LIKE A FRESCOED WALL
I CARVED MY VISION OUT OF WOOD AND STONE
I CAUGHT THE ECHOES OF A WORD SUPREME
AND METRED THE RHYTHM-BEATS OF INFINITY
AND LISTENED THROUGH MUSIC FOR THE ETERNAL VOICE
I FELT A COVERT TOUCH I HEARD A CALL
BUT COULD NOT CLASP THE BODY OF MY GOD
OR HOLD BETWEEN MY HANDS THE WORLD-MOTHER'S FEET
IN MEN I MET STRANGE PORTIONS OF A SELF
THAT SOUGHT FOR FRAGMENTS AND IN FRAGMENTS LIVED
EACH LIVED IN HIMSELF AND FOR HIMSELF ALONE
AND WITH THE REST JOINED ONLY FLEETING TIES
EACH PASSIONED OVER HIS SURFACE JOY AND GRIEF
NOR SAW THE ETERNAL IN HIS SECRET HOUSE
I CONVERSED WITH NATURE MUSED WITH THE CHANGELESS STARS
GOD'S WATCH-FIRES BURNING IN THE IGNORANT NIGHT
AND SAW UPON HER MIGHTY VISAGE FALL
A RAY PROPHETIC OF THE ETERNAL'S SUN
I SAT WITH THE FOREST SAGES IN THEIR TRANCE
THERE POURED AWAKENING STREAMS OF DIAMOND LIGHT
I GLIMPSED THE PRESENCE OF THE ONE IN ALL
BUT STILL THERE LACKED THE LAST TRANSCENDENT POWER
AND MATTER STILL SLEPT EMPTY OF ITS LORD
406
THE SPIRIT WAS SAVED THE BODY LOST AND MUTE
LIVED STILL WITH DEATH AND ANCIENT IGNORANCE
THE INCONSCIENT WAS ITS BASE THE VOID ITS FATE
BUT THOU HAST COME AND ALL WILL SURELY CHANGE
I SHALL FEEL THE WORLD-MOTHER IN THY GOLDEN LIMBS
AND HEAR HER WISDOM IN THY SACRED VOICE
THE CHILD OF THE VOID SHALL BE REBORN IN GOD
MY MATTER SHALL EVADE THE INCONSCIENT'S TRANCE
MY BODY LIKE MY SPIRIT SHALL BE FREE
IT SHALL ESCAPE FROM DEATH AND IGNORANCE
AND SAVITRI MUSING STILL REPLIED TO HIM
SPEAK MORE TO ME SPEAK MORE O SATYAVAN
SPEAK OF THYSELF AND ALL THOU ART WITHIN
I WOULD KNOW THEE AS IF WE HAD EVER LIVED
TOGETHER IN THE CHAMBER OF OUR SOULS
SPEAK TILL A LIGHT SHALL COME INTO MY HEART
AND MY MOVED MORTAL MIND SHALL UNDERSTAND
WHAT ALL THE DEATHLESS BEING IN ME FEELS
IT KNOWS THAT THOU ART HE MY SPIRIT HAS SOUGHT
AMIDST EARTH'S THRONGING VISAGES AND FORMS
ACROSS THE GOLDEN SPACES OF MY LIFE
AND SATYAVAN LIKE A REPLYING HARP
TO THE INSISTENT CALLING OF A FLUTE
ANSWERED HER QUESTIONING AND LET STREAM TO HER
HIS HEART IN MANY-COLOURED WAVES OF SPEECH
O GOLDEN PRINCESS PERFECT SAVITRI
MORE I WOULD TELL THAN FAILING WORDS CAN SPEAK
OF ALL THAT THOU HAST MEANT TO ME UNKNOWN
ALL THAT THE LIGHTNING-FLASH OF LOVE REVEALS
IN ONE GREAT HOUR OF THE UNVEILING GODS
EVEN A BRIEF NEARNESS HAS RESHAPED MY LIFE
FOR NOW I KNOW THAT ALL I LIVED AND WAS
MOVED TOWARDS THIS MOMENT OF MY HEART'S REBIRTH
I LOOK BACK ON THE MEANING OF MYSELF
A SOUL MADE READY ON EARTH'S SOIL FOR THEE
ONCE WERE MY DAYS LIKE DAYS OF OTHER MEN
407
TO THINK AND ACT WAS ALL TO ENJOY AND BREATHE
THIS WAS THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT OF MORTAL HOPE
YET THERE CAME GLIMPSES OF A DEEPER SELF
THAT LIVES BEHIND LIFE AND MAKES HER ACT ITS SCENE
A TRUTH WAS FELT THAT SCREENED ITS SHAPE FROM MIND
A GREATNESS WORKING TOWARDS A HIDDEN END
AND VAGUELY THROUGH THE FORMS OF EARTH THERE LOOKED
SOMETHING THAT LIFE IS NOT AND YET MUST BE
I GROPED FOR THE MYSTERY WITH THE LANTERN THOUGHT
ITS GLIMMERINGS LIGHTED WITH THE ABSTRACT WORD
A HALF-VISIBLE GROUND AND TRAVELLING YARD BY YARD
IT MAPPED A SYSTEM OF THE SELF AND GOD
I COULD NOT LIVE THE TRUTH IT SPOKE AND THOUGHT
I TURNED TO SEIZE ITS FORM IN VISIBLE THINGS
HOPING TO FIX ITS RULE BY MORTAL MIND
IMPOSED A NARROW STRUCTURE OF WORLD-LAW
UPON THE FREEDOM OF THE INFINITE
A HARD FIRM SKELETON OF OUTWARD TRUTH
A MENTAL SCHEME OF A MECHANIC POWER
THIS LIGHT SHOWED MORE THE DARKNESSES UNSEARCHED
IT MADE THE ORIGINAL SECRECY MORE OCCULT
IT COULD NOT ANALYSE ITS COSMIC VEIL
OR GLIMPSE THE WONDER-WORKER'S HIDDEN HAND
AND TRACE THE PATTERN OF HIS MAGIC PLANS
I PLUNGED INTO AN INNER SEEING MIND
AND KNEW THE SECRET LAWS AND SORCERIES
THAT MAKE OF MATTER MIND'S BEWILDERED SLAVE
THE MYSTERY WAS NOT SOLVED BUT DEEPENED MORE
I STROVE TO FIND ITS HINTS THROUGH BEAUTY AND ART
BUT FORM CANNOT UNVEIL THE INDWELLING POWER
ONLY IT THROWS ITS SYMBOLS AT OUR HEARTS
IT EVOKED A MOOD OF SELF INVOKED A SIGN
OF ALL THE BROODING GLORY HIDDEN IN SENSE
I LIVED IN THE RAY BUT FACED NOT TO THE SUN
I LOOKED UPON THE WORLD AND MISSED THE SELF
AND WHEN I FOUND THE SELF I LOST THE WORLD
408
MY OTHER SELVES I LOST AND THE BODY OF GOD
THE LINK OF THE FINITE WITH THE INFINITE
THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE APPEARANCE AND THE TRUTH
THE MYSTIC AIM FOR WHICH THE WORLD WAS MADE
THE HUMAN SENSE OF IMMORTALITY
BUT NOW THE GOLD LINK COMES TO ME WITH THY FEET
AND HIS GOLD SUN HAS SHONE ON ME FROM THY FACE
FOR NOW ANOTHER REALM DRAWS NEAR WITH THEE
AND NOW DIVINER VOICES FILL MY EAR
A STRANGE NEW WORLD SWIMS TO ME IN THY GAZE
APPROACHING LIKE A STAR FROM UNKNOWN HEAVENS
A CRY OF SPHERES COMES WITH THEE AND A SONG
OF FLAMING GODS I DRAW A WEALTHIER BREATH
AND IN A FIERIER MARCH OF MOMENTS MOVE
MY MIND TRANSFIGURES TO A RAPTUROUS SEER
A FOAM-LEAP TRAVELLING FROM THE WAVES OF BLISS
HAS CHANGED MY HEART AND CHANGED THE EARTH AROUND
ALL WITH THY COMING FILLS AIR SOIL AND STREAM
WEAR BRIDAL RAIMENT TO BE FIT FOR THEE
AND SUNLIGHT GROWS A SHADOW OF THY HUE
BECAUSE OF CHANGE WITHIN ME BY THY LOOK
COME NEARER TO ME FROM THY CAR OF LIGHT
ON THIS GREEN SWARD DISDAINING NOT OUR SOIL
FOR HERE ARE SECRET SPACES MADE FOR THEE
WHOSE CAVES OF EMERALD LONG TO SCREEN THY FORM
WILT THOU NOT MAKE THIS MORTAL BLISS THY SPHERE
DESCEND O HAPPINESS WITH THY MOON-GOLD FEET
ENRICH EARTH'S FLOORS UPON WHOSE SLEEP WE LIE
O MY BRIGHT BEAUTY'S PRINCESS SAVITRI
BY MY DELIGHT AND THY OWN JOY COMPELLED
ENTER MY LIFE THY CHAMBER AND THY SHRINE
IN THE GREAT QUIETNESS WHERE SPIRITS MEET
LED BY MY HUSHED DESIRE INTO MY WOODS
LET THE DIM RUSTLING ARCHES OVER THEE LEAN
ONE WITH THE BREATH OF THINGS ETERNAL LIVE
THY HEART-BEATS NEAR TO MINE TILL THERE SHALL LEAP
409
ENCHANTED FROM THE FRAGRANCE OF THE FLOWERS
A MOMENT WHICH ALL MURMURS SHALL RECALL
AND EVERY BIRD REMEMBER IN ITS CRY
ALLURED TO HER LASHES BY HIS PASSIONATE WORDS
HER FATHOMLESS SOUL LOOKED OUT AT HIM FROM HER EYES
PASSING HER LIPS IN LIQUID SOUNDS IT SPOKE
THIS WORD ALONE SHE UTTERED AND SAID ALL
O SATYAVAN I HAVE HEARD THEE AND I KNOW
I KNOW THAT THOU AND ONLY THOU ART HE
THEN DOWN SHE CAME FROM HER HIGH CARVEN CAR
DESCENDING WITH A SOFT AND FALTERING HASTE
HER MANY-HUED RAIMENT GLISTENING IN THE LIGHT
HOVERED A MOMENT OVER THE WIND-STIRRED GRASS
MIXED WITH A GLIMMER OF HER BODY'S RAY
LIKE LOVELY PLUMAGE OF A SETTLING BIRD
HER GLEAMING FEET UPON THE GREEN-GOLD SWARD
SCATTERED A MEMORY OF WANDERING BEAMS
AND LIGHTLY PRESSED THE UNSPOKEN DESIRE OF EARTH
CHERISHED IN HER TOO BRIEF PASSING BY THE SOIL
THEN FLITTING LIKE PALE-BRILLIANT MOTHS HER HANDS
TOOK FROM THE SYLVAN VERGE'S SUNLIT ARMS
A LOAD OF THEIR JEWEL-FACES' CLUSTERING SWARMS
COMPANIONS OF THE SPRING-TIME AND THE BREEZE
A CANDID GARLAND SET WITH SIMPLE FORMS
HER RAPID FINGERS TAUGHT A FLOWER SONG
THE STANZAED MOVEMENT OF A MARRIAGE HYMN
PROFOUND IN PERFUME AND IMMERSED IN HUE
THEY MIXED THEIR YEARNING'S COLOURED SIGNS AND MADE
THE BLOOM OF THEIR PURITY AND PASSION ONE
A SACRAMENT OF JOY IN TREASURING PALMS
SHE BROUGHT FLOWER-SYMBOL OF HER OFFERED LIFE
THEN WITH RAISED HANDS THAT TREMBLED A LITTLE NOW
AT THE VERY CLOSENESS THAT HER SOUL DESIRED
THIS BOND OF SWEETNESS THEIR BRIGHT UNION'S SIGN
SHE LAID ON THE BOSOM COVETED BY HER LOVE
410
AS IF INCLINED BEFORE SOME GRACIOUS GOD
WHO HAS OUT OF HIS MIST OF GREATNESS SHONE
TO FILL WITH BEAUTY HIS ADORER'S HOURS
SHE BOWED AND TOUCHED HIS FEET WITH WORSHIPPING HANDS
SHE MADE HER LIFE HIS WORLD FOR HIM TO TREAD
AND MADE HER BODY THE ROOM OF HIS DELIGHT
HER BEATING HEART A REMEMBRANCER OF BLISS
HE BENT TO HER AND TOOK INTO HIS OWN
THEIR MARRIED YEARNING JOINED LIKE FOLDED HOPES
AS IF A WHOLE RICH WORLD SUDDENLY POSSESSED
WEDDED TO ALL HE HAD BEEN BECAME HIMSELF
AN INEXHAUSTIBLE JOY MADE HIS ALONE
HE GATHERED ALL SAVITRI INTO HIS CLASP
AROUND HER HIS EMBRACE BECAME THE SIGN
OF A LOCKED CLOSENESS THROUGH SLOW INTIMATE YEARS
A FIRST SWEET SUMMARY OF DELIGHT TO COME
ONE BREVITY INTENSE OF ALL LONG LIFE
IN A WIDE MOMENT OF TWO SOULS THAT MEET
SHE FELT HER BEING FLOW INTO HIM AS IN WAVES
A RIVER POURS INTO A MIGHTY SEA
AS WHEN A SOUL IS MERGING INTO GOD
TO LIVE IN HIM FOR EVER AND KNOW HIS JOY
HER CONSCIOUSNESS GREW AWARE OF HIM ALONE
AND ALL HER SEPARATE SELF WAS LOST IN HIS
AS A STARRY HEAVEN ENCIRCLES HAPPY EARTH
HE SHUT HER INTO HIMSELF IN A CIRCLE OF BLISS
AND SHUT THE WORLD INTO HIMSELF AND HER
A BOUNDLESS ISOLATION MADE THEM ONE
HE WAS AWARE OF HER ENVELOPING HIM
AND LET HER PENETRATE HIS VERY SOUL
AS IS A WORLD BY THE WORLD'S SPIRIT FILLED
AS THE MORTAL WAKES INTO ETERNITY
AS THE FINITE OPENS TO THE INFINITE
THUS WERE THEY IN EACH OTHER LOST AWHILE
THEN DRAWING BACK FROM THEIR LONG ECSTASY'S TRANCE
CAME INTO A NEW SELF AND A NEW WORLD
411
EACH NOW WAS A PART OF THE OTHER'S UNITY
THE WORLD WAS BUT THEIR TWIN SELF-FINDING'S SCENE
OR THEIR OWN WEDDED BEING'S VASTER FRAME
ON THE HIGH GLOWING CUPOLA OF THE DAY
FATE TIED A KNOT WITH MORNING'S HALO THREADS
WHILE BY THE MINISTRY OF AN AUSPICE-HOUR
HEART-BOUND BEFORE THE SUN THEIR MARRIAGE FIRE
THE WEDDING OF THE ETERNAL LORD AND SPOUSE
TOOK PLACE AGAIN ON EARTH IN HUMAN FORMS
IN A NEW ACT OF THE DRAMA OF THE WORLD
THE UNITED TWO BEGAN A GREATER AGE
IN THE SILENCE AND MURMUR OF THAT EMERALD WORLD
AND THE MUTTER OF THE PRIEST-WIND'S SACRED VERSE
AMID THE CHORAL WHISPERING OF THE LEAVES
LOVE'S TWAIN HAD JOINED TOGETHER AND GREW ONE
THE NATURAL MIRACLE WAS WROUGHT ONCE MORE
IN THE IMMUTABLE IDEAL WORLD
ONE HUMAN MOMENT WAS ETERNAL MADE
THEN DOWN THE NARROW PATH WHERE THEIR LIVES HAD MET
HE LED AND SHOWED TO HER HER FUTURE WORLD
LOVE'S REFUGE AND CORNER OF HAPPY SOLITUDE
AT THE PATH'S END THROUGH A GREEN CLEFT IN THE TREES
SHE SAW A CLUSTERING LINE OF HERMIT-ROOFS
AND LOOKED NOW FIRST ON HER HEART'S FUTURE HOME
THE THATCH THAT COVERED THE LIFE OF SATYAVAN
ADORNED WITH CREEPERS AND RED CLIMBING FLOWERS
IT SEEMED A SYLVAN BEAUTY IN HER DREAMS
SLUMBERING WITH BROWN BODY AND TUMBLED HAIR
IN HER CHAMBER INVIOLATE OF EMERALD PEACE
AROUND IT STRETCHED THE FOREST'S ANCHORITE MOOD
LOST IN THE DEPTHS OF ITS OWN SOLITUDE
THEN MOVED BY THE DEEP JOY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
A LITTLE DEPTH OF IT QUIVERING IN HER WORDS
HER HAPPY VOICE CRIED OUT TO SATYAVAN
MY HEART WILL STAY HERE ON THIS FOREST VERGE
412
AND CLOSE TO THIS THATCHED ROOF WHILE I AM FAR
NOW OF MORE WANDERING IT HAS NO NEED
BUT I MUST HASTE BACK TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
WHICH SOON WILL LOSE ONE LOVED ACCUSTOMED TREAD
AND LISTEN IN VAIN FOR A ONCE CHERISHED VOICE
FOR SOON I SHALL RETURN NOR EVER AGAIN
ONENESS MUST SEVER ITS RECOVERED BLISS
OR FATE SUNDER OUR LIVES WHILE LIFE IS OURS
ONCE MORE SHE MOUNTED ON THE CARVEN CAR
AND UNDER THE ARDOUR OF A FIERY NOON
LESS BRIGHT THAN THE SPLENDOUR OF HER THOUGHTS AND DREAMS
SHE SPED SWIFT-REINED SWIFT-HEARTED BUT STILL SAW
IN STILL LUCIDITIES OF SIGHT'S INNER WORLD
THROUGH THE COOL-SCENTED WOOD'S LUXURIOUS GLOOM
ON SHADOWY PATHS BETWEEN GREAT RUGGED TRUNKS
PACE TOWARDS A TRANQUIL CLEARING SATYAVAN
A NAVE OF TREES ENSHRINED THE HERMIT THATCH
THE NEW DEEP COVERT OF HER FELICITY
PREFERRED TO HEAVEN HER SOUL'S TEMPLE AND HOME
THIS NOW REMAINED WITH HER HER HEART'S CONSTANT SCENE
415
IN SILENT BOUNDS BORDERING THE MORTAL'S PLANE
CROSSING A WIDE EXPANSE OF BRILLIANT PEACE
NARAD THE HEAVENLY SAGE FROM PARADISE
CAME CHANTING THROUGH THE LARGE AND LUSTROUS AIR
ATTRACTED BY THE GOLDEN SUMMER-EARTH
THAT LAY BENEATH HIM LIKE A GLOWING BOWL
TILTED UPON A TABLE OF THE GODS
TURNING AS IF MOVED ROUND BY AN UNSEEN HAND
TO CATCH THE WARMTH AND BLAZE OF A SMALL SUN
HE PASSED FROM THE IMMORTALS' HAPPY PATHS
TO A WORLD OF TOIL AND QUEST AND GRIEF AND HOPE
TO THESE ROOMS OF THE SEE-SAW GAME OF DEATH WITH LIFE
ACROSS AN INTANGIBLE BORDER OF SOUL-SPACE
HE PASSED FROM MIND INTO MATERIAL THINGS
AMID THE INVENTIONS OF THE INCONSCIENT SELF
AND THE WORKINGS OF A BLIND SOMNAMBULIST FORCE
BELOW HIM CIRCLING BURNED THE MYRIAD SUNS
HE BORE THE RIPPLES OF THE ETHERIC SEA
A PRIMAL AIR BROUGHT THE FIRST JOY OF TOUCH
A SECRET SPIRIT DREW ITS MIGHTY BREATH
CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING THIS HUGE WORLD
IN ITS FORMIDABLE CIRCUIT THROUGH THE VOID
THE SECRET MIGHT OF THE CREATIVE FIRE
DISPLAYED ITS TRIPLE POWER TO BUILD AND FORM
ITS INFINITESIMAL WAVE-SPARKS' WEAVING DANCE
ITS NEBULOUS UNITS GROUNDING SHAPE AND MASS
MAGIC FOUNDATION AND PATTERN OF A WORLD
ITS RADIANCE BURSTING INTO THE LIGHT OF STARS
HE FELT A SAP OF LIFE A SAP OF DEATH
INTO SOLID MATTER'S DENSE COMMUNION
PLUNGING AND ITS OBSCURE ONENESS OF FORMS
416
HE SHARED WITH A DUMB SPIRIT IDENTITY
HE BEHELD THE COSMIC BEING AT HIS TASK
HIS EYES MEASURED THE SPACES GAUGED THE DEPTHS
HIS INNER GAZE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SOUL
HE SAW THE ETERNAL LABOUR OF THE GODS
AND LOOKED UPON THE LIFE OF BEASTS AND MEN
A CHANGE NOW FELL UPON THE SINGER'S MOOD
A RAPTURE AND A PATHOS MOVED HIS VOICE
HE SANG NO MORE OF LIGHT THAT NEVER WANES
AND ONENESS AND PURE EVERLASTING BLISS
HE SANG NO MORE THE DEATHLESS HEART OF LOVE
HIS CHANT WAS A HYMN OF IGNORANCE AND FATE
HE SANG THE NAME OF VISHNU AND THE BIRTH
AND JOY AND PASSION OF THE MYSTIC WORLD
AND HOW THE STARS WERE MADE AND LIFE BEGAN
AND THE MUTE REGIONS STIRRED WITH THE THROB OF A SOUL
HE SANG THE INCONSCIENT AND ITS SECRET SELF
ITS POWER OMNIPOTENT KNOWING NOT WHAT IT DOES
ALL-SHAPING WITHOUT WILL OR THOUGHT OR SENSE
ITS BLIND UNERRING OCCULT MYSTERY
AND DARKNESS YEARNING TOWARDS THE ETERNAL LIGHT
AND LOVE THAT BROODS WITHIN THE DIM ABYSS
AND WAITS THE ANSWER OF THE HUMAN HEART
AND DEATH THAT CLIMBS TO IMMORTALITY
HE SANG OF THE TRUTH THAT CRIES FROM NIGHT'S BLIND DEEPS
AND THE MOTHER-WISDOM HID IN NATURE'S BREAST
AND THE IDEA THAT THROUGH HER DUMBNESS WORKS
AND THE MIRACLE OF HER TRANSFORMING HANDS
OF LIFE THAT SLUMBERS IN THE STONE AND SUN
AND MIND SUBLIMINAL IN MINDLESS LIFE
AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WAKES IN BEASTS AND MEN
HE SANG OF THE GLORY AND MARVEL STILL TO BE BORN
OF GODHEAD THROWING OFF AT LAST ITS VEIL
OF BODIES MADE DIVINE AND LIFE MADE BLISS
IMMORTAL SWEETNESS CLASPING IMMORTAL MIGHT
HEART SENSING HEART THOUGHT LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THOUGHT
417
AND THE DELIGHT WHEN EVERY BARRIER FALLS
AND THE TRANSFIGURATION AND THE ECSTASY
AND AS HE SANG THE DEMONS WEPT WITH JOY
FORESEEING THE END OF THEIR LONG DREADFUL TASK
AND THE DEFEAT FOR WHICH THEY HOPED IN VAIN
AND GLAD RELEASE FROM THEIR SELF-CHOSEN DOOM
AND RETURN INTO THE ONE FROM WHOM THEY CAME
HE WHO HAS CONQUERED THE IMMORTALS' SEATS
CAME DOWN TO MEN ON EARTH THE MAN DIVINE
AS DARTS A LIGHTNING STREAK A GLORY FELL
NEARING UNTIL THE RAPT EYES OF THE SAGE
LOOKED OUT FROM LUMINOUS CLOUD AND STRANGELY LIMNED
HIS FACE A BEAUTIFUL MASK OF ANTIQUE JOY
APPEARING IN LIGHT DESCENDED WHERE AROSE
KING ASWAPATI'S PALACE TO THE WINDS
IN MADRA FLOWERING UP IN DELICATE STONE
THERE WELCOMED HIM THE SAGE AND THOUGHTFUL KING
AT HIS SIDE A CREATURE BEAUTIFUL PASSIONATE WISE
ASPIRING LIKE A SACRIFICIAL FLAME
SKYWARD FROM ITS EARTH-SEAT THROUGH LUMINOUS AIR
QUEEN-BROWED THE HUMAN MOTHER OF SAVITRI
THERE FOR AN HOUR UNTOUCHED BY THE EARTH'S SIEGE
THEY CEASED FROM COMMON LIFE AND CARE AND SAT
INCLINING TO THE HIGH AND RHYTHMIC VOICE
WHILE IN HIS MEASURED CHANT THE HEAVENLY SEER
SPOKE OF THE TOILS OF MEN AND WHAT THE GODS
STRIVE FOR ON EARTH AND JOY THAT THROBS BEHIND
THE MARVEL AND THE MYSTERY OF PAIN
HE SANG TO THEM OF THE LOTUS-HEART OF LOVE
WITH ALL ITS THOUSAND LUMINOUS BUDS OF TRUTH
WHICH QUIVERING SLEEPS VEILED BY APPARENT THINGS
IT TREMBLES AT EACH TOUCH IT STRIVES TO WAKE
AND ONE DAY IT SHALL HEAR A BLISSFUL VOICE
AND IN THE GARDEN OF THE SPOUSE SHALL BLOOM
WHEN SHE IS SEIZED BY HER DISCOVERED LORD
A MIGHTY SHUDDERING COIL OF ECSTASY
418
CREPT THROUGH THE DEEP HEART OF THE UNIVERSE
OUT OF HER MATTER'S STUPOR HER MIND'S DREAMS
SHE WOKE SHE LOOKED UPON GOD'S UNVEILED FACE
EVEN AS HE SANG AND RAPTURE STOLE THROUGH EARTH-TIME
AND CAUGHT THE HEAVENS CAME WITH A CALL OF HOOVES
AS OF HER SWIFT HEART HASTENING SAVITRI
HER RADIANT TREAD GLIMMERED ACROSS THE FLOOR
A HAPPY WONDER IN HER FATHOMLESS GAZE
CHANGED BY THE HALO OF HER LOVE SHE CAME
HER EYES RICH WITH A SHINING MIST OF JOY
AS ONE WHO COMES FROM A HEAVENLY EMBASSY
DISCHARGING THE PROUD MISSION OF HER HEART
ONE CARRYING THE SANCTION OF THE GODS
TO HER LOVE AND ITS LUMINOUS ETERNITY
SHE STOOD BEFORE HER MIGHTY FATHER'S THRONE
AND EAGER FOR BEAUTY ON DISCOVERED EARTH
TRANSFORMED AND NEW IN HER HEART'S MIRACLE-LIGHT
SAW LIKE A ROSE OF MARVEL WORSHIPPING
THE FIRE-TINGED SWEETNESS OF THE SON OF HEAVEN
HE FLUNG ON HER HIS VAST IMMORTAL LOOK
HIS INNER GAZE SURROUNDED HER WITH ITS LIGHT
AND REINING BACK KNOWLEDGE FROM HIS IMMORTAL LIPS
HE CRIED TO HER WHO IS THIS THAT COMES THE BRIDE
THE FLAME-BORN AND ROUND HER ILLUMINED HEAD
POURING THEIR LIGHTS HER HYMENEAL POMPS
MOVE FLASHING ABOUT HER FROM WHAT GREEN GLIMMER OF GLADES
RETREATING INTO DEWY SILENCES
OR HALF-SEEN VERGE OF WATERS MOON-BETRAYED
BRINGST THOU THIS GLORY OF ENCHANTED EYES
EARTH HAS GOLD-HUED EXPANSES SHADOWY HILLS
THAT COWL THEIR DREAMING PHANTOM HEADS IN NIGHT
AND GUARDED IN A CLOISTRAL JOY OF WOODS
SCREENED BANKS SINK DOWN INTO FELICITY
SEIZED BY THE CURVED INCESSANT YEARNING HANDS
AND RIPPLE-PASSION OF THE UPGAZING STREAM
419
AMID COOL-LIPPED MURMURS OF ITS PURE EMBRACE
THEY LOSE THEIR SOULS ON BEDS OF TREMBLING REEDS
AND ALL THESE ARE MYSTERIOUS PRESENCES
IN WHICH SOME SPIRIT'S IMMORTAL BLISS IS FELT
AND THEY BETRAY THE EARTH-BORN HEART TO JOY
THERE HAST THOU PAUSED AND MARVELLING BORNE EYES
UNKNOWN OR HEARD A VOICE THAT FORCED THY LIFE
TO STRAIN ITS RAPTURE THROUGH THY LISTENING SOUL
OR IF MY THOUGHT COULD TRUST THIS SHIMMERING GAZE
IT WOULD SAY THOU HAST NOT DRUNK FROM AN EARTHLY CUP
BUT STEPPING THROUGH AZURE CURTAINS OF THE NOON
THOU WAST SURROUNDED ON A MAGIC VERGE
IN BRIGHTER COUNTRIES THAN MAN'S EYES CAN BEAR
ASSAILED BY TROOPING VOICES OF DELIGHT
AND SEIZED MID A SUNLIT GLAMOUR OF THE BOUGHS
IN FAERY WOODS LED DOWN THE GLEAMING SLOPES
OF GANDHAMADAN WHERE THE APSARAS ROAM
THY LIMBS HAVE SHARED THE SPORTS WHICH NONE HAS SEEN
AND IN GOD-HAUNTS THY HUMAN FOOTSTEPS STRAYED
THY MORTAL BOSOM QUIVERED WITH GOD-SPEECH
AND THY SOUL ANSWERED TO A WORD UNKNOWN
WHAT FEET OF GODS WHAT RAVISHING FLUTES OF HEAVEN
HAVE THRILLED HIGH MELODIES ROUND FROM NEAR AND FAR
APPROACHING THROUGH THE SOFT AND REVELLING AIR
WHICH STILL SURPRISED THOU HEAREST THEY HAVE FED
THY SILENCE ON SOME RED STRANGE-ECSTASIED FRUIT
AND THOU HAST TROD THE DIM MOON-PEAKS OF BLISS
REVEAL O WINGED WITH LIGHT WHENCE THOU HAST FLOWN
HASTENING BRIGHT-HUED THROUGH THE GREEN TANGLED EARTH
THY BODY RHYTHMICAL WITH THE SPRING-BIRD'S CALL
THE EMPTY ROSES OF THY HANDS ARE FILLED
ONLY WITH THEIR OWN BEAUTY AND THE THRILL
OF A REMEMBERED CLASP AND IN THEE GLOWS
A HEAVENLY JAR THY FIRM DEEP-HONIED HEART
NEW-BRIMMING WITH A SWEET AND NECTAROUS WINE
THOU HAST NOT SPOKEN WITH THE KINGS OF PAIN
420
LIFE'S PERILOUS MUSIC RINGS YET TO THY EAR
FAR-MELODIED RAPID AND GRAND A CENTAUR'S SONG
OR SOFT AS WATER PLASHING MID THE HILLS
OR MIGHTY AS A GREAT CHANT OF MANY WINDS
MOON-BRIGHT THOU LIVEST IN THY INNER BLISS
THOU COMEST LIKE A SILVER DEER THROUGH GROVES
OF CORAL FLOWERS AND BUDS OF GLOWING DREAMS
OR FLEEST LIKE A WIND-GODDESS THROUGH LEAVES
OR ROAMST O RUBY-EYED AND SNOW-WINGED DOVE
FLITTING THROUGH THICKETS OF THY PURE DESIRES
IN THE UNWOUNDED BEAUTY OF THY SOUL
THESE THINGS ARE ONLY IMAGES TO THY EARTH
BUT TRUEST TRUTH OF THAT WHICH IN THEE SLEEPS
FOR SUCH IS THY SPIRIT A SISTER OF THE GODS
THY EARTHLY BODY LOVELY TO THE EYES
AND THOU ART KIN IN JOY TO HEAVEN'S SONS
O THOU WHO HAST COME TO THIS GREAT PERILOUS WORLD
NOW ONLY SEEN THROUGH THE SPLENDOUR OF THY DREAMS
WHERE HARDLY LOVE AND BEAUTY CAN LIVE SAFE
THYSELF A BEING DANGEROUSLY GREAT
A SOUL ALONE IN A GOLDEN HOUSE OF THOUGHT
HAS LIVED WALLED IN BY THE SAFETY OF THY DREAMS
ON HEIGHTS OF HAPPINESS LEAVING DOOM ASLEEP
WHO HUNTS UNSEEN THE UNCONSCIOUS LIVES OF MEN
IF THY HEART COULD LIVE LOCKED IN THE IDEAL'S GOLD
AS HIGH AS HAPPY MIGHT THY WAKING BE
IF FOR ALL TIME DOOM COULD BE LEFT TO SLEEP
HE SPOKE BUT HELD HIS KNOWLEDGE BACK FROM WORDS
AS A CLOUD PLAYS WITH LIGHTNINGS' VIVID LAUGH
BUT STILL HOLDS BACK THE THUNDER IN ITS HEART
ONLY HE LET BRIGHT IMAGES ESCAPE
HIS SPEECH LIKE GLIMMERING MUSIC VEILED HIS THOUGHTS
AS A WIND FLATTERS THE BRIGHT SUMMER AIR
PITIFUL TO MORTALS ONLY TO THEM IT SPOKE
OF LIVING BEAUTY AND OF PRESENT BLISS
HE HID IN HIS ALL-KNOWING MIND THE REST
421
TO THOSE WHO HEARKENED TO HIS CELESTIAL VOICE
THE VEIL HEAVEN'S PITY THROWS ON FUTURE PAIN
THE IMMORTALS' SANCTION SEEMED OF ENDLESS JOY
BUT ASWAPATI ANSWERED TO THE SEER
HIS LISTENING MIND HAD MARKED THE DUBIOUS CLOSE
AN OMINOUS SHADOW FELT BEHIND THE WORDS
BUT CALM LIKE ONE WHO EVER SITS FACING FATE
HERE MID THE DANGEROUS CONTOURS OF EARTH'S LIFE
HE ANSWERED COVERT THOUGHT WITH GUARDED SPEECH
O DEATHLESS SAGE WHO KNOWEST ALL THINGS HERE
IF I COULD READ BY THE RAY OF MY OWN WISH
THROUGH THE CARVED SHIELD OF SYMBOL IMAGES
WHICH THOU HAST THROWN BEFORE THY HEAVENLY MIND
I MIGHT SEE THE STEPS OF A YOUNG GODLIKE LIFE
HAPPILY BEGINNING LUMINOUS-EYED ON EARTH
BETWEEN THE UNKNOWABLE AND THE UNSEEN
BORN ON THE BORDERS OF TWO WONDER-WORLDS
IT FLAMES OUT SYMBOLS OF THE INFINITE
AND LIVES IN A GREAT LIGHT OF INNER SUNS
FOR IT HAS READ AND BROKEN THE WIZARD SEALS
IT HAS DRUNK OF THE IMMORTAL'S WELLS OF JOY
IT HAS LOOKED ACROSS THE JEWEL BARS OF HEAVEN
IT HAS ENTERED THE ASPIRING SECRECY
IT SEES BEYOND TERRESTRIAL COMMON THINGS
AND COMMUNES WITH THE POWERS THAT BUILD THE WORLDS
TILL THROUGH THE SHINING GATES AND MYSTIC STREETS
OF THE CITY OF LAPIS LAZULI AND PEARL
PROUD DEEDS STEP FORTH A RANK AND MARCH OF GODS
ALTHOUGH IN PAUSES OF OUR HUMAN LIVES
EARTH KEEPS FOR MAN SOME SHORT AND PERFECT HOURS
WHEN THE INCONSTANT TREAD OF TIME CAN SEEM
THE ETERNAL MOMENT WHICH THE DEATHLESS LIVE
YET RARE THAT TOUCH UPON THE MORTAL'S WORLD
HARDLY A SOUL AND BODY HERE ARE BORN
IN THE FIERCE DIFFICULT MOVEMENT OF THE STARS
WHOSE LIFE CAN KEEP THE PARADISAL NOTE
422
ITS RHYTHM REPEAT THE MANY-TONED MELODY
TIRELESSLY THROBBING THROUGH THE RAPTUROUS AIR
CAUGHT IN THE SONG THAT SWAYS THE APSARA'S LIMBS
WHEN SHE FLOATS GLEAMING LIKE A CLOUD OF LIGHT
A WAVE OF JOY ON HEAVEN'S MOONSTONE FLOOR
BEHOLD THIS IMAGE CAST BY LIGHT AND LOVE
A STANZA OF THE ARDOUR OF THE GODS
PERFECTLY RHYMED A PILLARED RIPPLE OF GOLD
HER BODY LIKE A BRIMMED PITCHER OF DELIGHT
SHAPED IN A SPLENDOUR OF GOLD-COLOURED BRONZE
AS IF TO SEIZE EARTH'S TRUTH OF HIDDEN BLISS
DREAM-MADE ILLUMINED MIRRORS ARE HER EYES
DRAPED SUBTLY IN A SLUMBROUS FRINGE OF JET
RETAINING HEAVEN'S REFLECTIONS IN THEIR DEPTHS
EVEN AS HER BODY SUCH IS SHE WITHIN
HEAVEN'S LUSTROUS MORNINGS GLORIOUSLY RECUR
LIKE DROPS OF FIRE UPON A SILVER PAGE
IN HER YOUNG SPIRIT YET UNTOUCHED WITH TEARS
ALL BEAUTIFUL THINGS ETERNAL SEEM AND NEW
TO VIRGIN WONDER IN HER CRYSTAL SOUL
THE UNCHANGING BLUE REVEALS ITS SPACIOUS THOUGHT
MARVELLOUS THE MOON FLOATS ON THROUGH WONDERING SKIES
EARTH'S FLOWERS SPRING UP AND LAUGH AT TIME AND DEATH
THE CHARMED MUTATIONS OF THE ENCHANTER LIFE
RACE LIKE BRIGHT CHILDREN PAST THE SMILING HOURS
IF BUT THIS JOY OF LIFE COULD LAST NOR PAIN
THROW ITS BRONZE NOTE INTO HER RHYTHMED DAYS
BEHOLD HER SINGER WITH THE PRESCIENT GAZE
AND LET THY BLESSING CHANT THAT THIS FAIR CHILD
SHALL POUR THE NECTAR OF A SORROWLESS LIFE
AROUND HER FROM HER LUCID HEART OF LOVE
HEAL WITH HER BLISS THE TIRED BREAST OF EARTH
AND CAST LIKE A HAPPY SNARE FELICITY
AS GROWS THE GREAT AND GOLDEN BOUNTEOUS TREE
FLOWERING BY ALACANANDA'S MURMURING WAVES
WHERE WITH ENAMOURED SPEED THE WATERS RUN
423
LISPING AND BABBLING TO THE SPLENDOUR OF MORN
AND CLING WITH LYRIC LAUGHTER ROUND THE KNEES
OF HEAVEN'S DAUGHTERS DRIPPING MAGIC RAIN
PEARL-BRIGHT FROM MOON-GOLD LIMBS AND CLOUDY HAIR
SO ARE HER DAWNS LIKE JEWELLED LEAVES OF LIGHT
SO CASTS SHE HER FELICITY ON MEN
A FLAME OF RADIANT HAPPINESS SHE WAS BORN
AND SURELY WILL THAT FLAME SET EARTH ALIGHT
DOOM SURELY WILL SEE HER PASS AND SAY NO WORD
BUT TOO OFTEN HERE THE CARELESS MOTHER LEAVES
HER CHOSEN IN THE ENVIOUS HANDS OF FATE
THE HARP OF GOD FALLS MUTE ITS CALL TO BLISS
DISCOURAGED FAILS MID EARTH'S UNHAPPY SOUNDS
THE STRINGS OF THE SIREN ECSTASY CRY NOT HERE
OR SOON ARE SILENCED IN THE HUMAN HEART
OF SORROW'S SONGS WE HAVE ENOUGH BID ONCE
HER GLAD AND GRIEFLESS DAYS BRING HEAVEN HERE
OR MUST FIRE ALWAYS TEST THE GREAT OF SOUL
ALONG THE DREADFUL CAUSEWAY OF THE GODS
ARMOURED WITH LOVE AND FAITH AND SACRED JOY
A TRAVELLER TO THE ETERNAL'S HOUSE
ONCE LET UNWOUNDED PASS A MORTAL LIFE
BUT NARAD ANSWERED NOT SILENT HE SAT
KNOWING THAT WORDS ARE VAIN AND FATE IS LORD
HE LOOKED INTO THE UNSEEN WITH SEEING EYES
THEN DALLYING WITH THE MORTAL'S IGNORANCE
LIKE ONE WHO KNOWS NOT QUESTIONING HE CRIED
ON WHAT HIGH MISSION WENT HER HASTENING WHEELS
WHENCE CAME SHE WITH THIS GLORY IN HER HEART
AND PARADISE MADE VISIBLE IN HER EYES
WHAT SUDDEN GOD HAS MET WHAT FACE SUPREME
TO WHOM THE KING THE RED ASOCA WATCHED
HER GOING FORTH WHICH NOW SEES HER RETURN
ARISEN INTO AN AIR OF FLAMING DAWN
LIKE A BRIGHT BIRD TIRED OF HER LONELY BRANCH
TO FIND HER OWN LORD SINCE TO HER ON EARTH
424
HE CAME NOT YET THIS SWEETNESS WANDERED FORTH
CLEAVING HER WAY WITH THE BEAT OF HER RAPID WINGS
LED BY A DISTANT CALL HER VAGUE SWIFT FLIGHT
THREADED THE SUMMER MORNS AND SUNLIT LANDS
THE HAPPY REST HER BURDENED LASHES KEEP
AND THESE CHARMED GUARDIAN LIPS HOLD TREASURED STILL
VIRGIN WHO COMEST PERFECTED BY JOY
REVEAL THE NAME THY SUDDEN HEART-BEATS LEARNED
WHOM HAST THOU CHOSEN KINGLIEST AMONG MEN
AND SAVITRI ANSWERED WITH HER STILL CALM VOICE
AS ONE WHO SPEAKS BENEATH THE EYES OF FATE
FATHER AND KING I HAVE CARRIED OUT THY WILL
ONE WHOM I SOUGHT I FOUND IN DISTANT LANDS
I HAVE OBEYED MY HEART I HAVE HEARD ITS CALL
ON THE BORDERS OF A DREAMING WILDERNESS
MID SHALWA'S GIANT HILLS AND BROODING WOODS
IN HIS THATCHED HERMITAGE DYUMATSENA DWELLS
BLIND EXILED OUTCAST ONCE A MIGHTY KING
THE SON OF DYUMATSENA SATYAVAN
I HAVE MET ON THE WILD FOREST'S LONELY VERGE
MY FATHER I HAVE CHOSEN THIS IS DONE
ASTONISHED ALL SAT SILENT FOR A SPACE
THEN ASWAPATI LOOKED WITHIN AND SAW
A HEAVY SHADOW FLOAT ABOVE THE NAME
CHASED BY A SUDDEN AND STUPENDOUS LIGHT
HE LOOKED INTO HIS DAUGHTER'S EYES AND SPOKE
WELL HAST THOU DONE AND I APPROVE THY CHOICE
IF THIS IS ALL THEN ALL IS SURELY WELL
IF THERE IS MORE THEN ALL CAN STILL BE WELL
WHETHER IT SEEM GOOD OR EVIL TO MEN'S EYES
ONLY FOR GOOD THE SECRET WILL CAN WORK
OUR DESTINY IS WRITTEN IN DOUBLE TERMS
THROUGH NATURE'S CONTRARIES WE DRAW NEARER GOD
OUT OF THE DARKNESS WE STILL GROW TO LIGHT
DEATH IS OUR ROAD TO IMMORTALITY
'CRY WOE CRY WOE' THE WORLD'S LOST VOICES WAIL
425
YET CONQUERS THE ETERNAL GOOD AT LAST
THEN MIGHT THE SAGE HAVE SPOKEN BUT THE KING
IN HASTE BROKE OUT AND STAYED THE DANGEROUS WORD
O SINGER OF THE ULTIMATE ECSTASY
LEND NOT A DANGEROUS VISION TO THE BLIND
BECAUSE BY NATIVE RIGHT THOU HAST SEEN CLEAR
IMPOSE NOT ON THE MORTAL'S TREMULOUS BREAST
THE DIRE ORDEAL THAT FOREKNOWLEDGE BRINGS
DEMAND NOT NOW THE GODHEAD IN OUR ACTS
HERE ARE NOT HAPPY PEAKS THE HEAVEN-NYMPHS ROAM
OR COILAS OR VAICOUNTHA'S STARRY STAIR
ABRUPT JAGGED HILLS ONLY THE MIGHTY CLIMB
ARE HERE WHERE FEW DARE EVEN THINK TO RISE
FAR VOICES CALL DOWN FROM THE DIZZY ROCKS
CHILL SLIPPERY PRECIPITOUS ARE THE PATHS
TOO HARD THE GODS ARE WITH MAN'S FRAGILE RACE
IN THEIR LARGE HEAVENS THEY DWELL EXEMPT FROM FATE
AND THEY FORGET THE WOUNDED FEET OF MAN
HIS LIMBS THAT FAINT BENEATH THE WHIPS OF GRIEF
HIS HEART THAT HEARS THE TREAD OF TIME AND DEATH
THE FUTURE'S ROAD IS HID FROM MORTAL SIGHT
HE MOVES TOWARDS A VEILED AND SECRET FACE
TO LIGHT ONE STEP IN FRONT IS ALL HIS HOPE
AND ONLY FOR A LITTLE STRENGTH HE ASKS
TO MEET THE RIDDLE OF HIS SHROUDED FATE
AWAITED BY A VAGUE AND HALF-SEEN FORCE
AWARE OF DANGER TO HIS UNCERTAIN HOURS
HE GUARDS HIS FLICKERING YEARNINGS FROM HER BREATH
HE FEELS NOT WHEN THE DREADFUL FINGERS CLOSE
AROUND HIM WITH THE GRASP NONE CAN ELUDE
IF THOU CANST LOOSE HER GRIP THEN ONLY SPEAK
PERHAPS FROM THE IRON SNARE THERE IS ESCAPE
OUR MIND PERHAPS DECEIVES US WITH ITS WORDS
AND GIVES THE NAME OF DOOM TO OUR OWN CHOICE
PERHAPS THE BLINDNESS OF OUR WILL IS FATE
HE SAID AND NARAD ANSWERED NOT THE KING
426
BUT NOW THE QUEEN ALARMED LIFTED HER VOICE
O SEER THY BRIGHT ARRIVAL HAS BEEN TIMED
TO THIS HIGH MOMENT OF A HAPPY LIFE
THEN LET THE SPEECH BENIGN OF GRIEFLESS SPHERES
CONFIRM THIS BLITHE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS
AND SANCTION JOY WITH THY CELESTIAL VOICE
HERE DRAG NOT IN THE PERIL OF OUR THOUGHTS
LET NOT OUR WORDS CREATE THE DOOM THEY FEAR
HERE IS NO CAUSE FOR DREAD NO CHANCE FOR GRIEF
TO RAISE HER OMINOUS HEAD AND STARE AT LOVE
A SINGLE SPIRIT IN A MULTITUDE
HAPPY IS SATYAVAN MID EARTHLY MEN
WHOM SAVITRI HAS CHOSEN FOR HER MATE
AND FORTUNATE THE FOREST HERMITAGE
WHERE LEAVING HER PALACE AND RICHES AND A THRONE
MY SAVITRI WILL DWELL AND BRING IN HEAVEN
THEN LET THY BLESSING PUT THE IMMORTALS' SEAL
ON THESE BRIGHT LIVES' UNSTAINED FELICITY
PUSHING THE OMINOUS SHADOW FROM THEIR DAYS
TOO HEAVY FALLS A SHADOW ON MAN'S HEART
IT DARES NOT BE TOO HAPPY UPON EARTH
IT DREADS THE BLOW DOGGING TOO VIVID JOYS
A LASH UNSEEN IN FATE'S EXTENDED HAND
THE DANGER LURKING IN FORTUNE'S PROUD EXTREMES
AN IRONY IN LIFE'S INDULGENT SMILE
AND TREMBLES AT THE LAUGHTER OF THE GODS
OR IF CROUCHES UNSEEN A PANTHER DOOM
IF WINGS OF EVIL BROOD ABOVE THAT HOUSE
THEN ALSO SPEAK THAT WE MAY TURN ASIDE
AND RESCUE OUR LIVES FROM HAZARD OF WAYSIDE DOOM
AND CHANCE ENTANGLEMENT OF AN ALIEN FATE
AND NARAD SLOWLY ANSWERED TO THE QUEEN
WHAT HELP IS IN PREVISION TO THE DRIVEN
SAFE DOORS CRY OPENING NEAR THE DOOMED PASS ON
A FUTURE KNOWLEDGE IS AN ADDED PAIN
A TORTURING BURDEN AND A FRUITLESS LIGHT
427
ON THE ENORMOUS SCENE THAT FATE HAS BUILT
THE ETERNAL POET UNIVERSAL MIND
HAS PAGED EACH LINE OF HIS IMPERIAL ACT
INVISIBLE THE GIANT ACTORS TREAD
AND MAN LIVES LIKE SOME SECRET PLAYER'S MASK
HE KNOWS NOT EVEN WHAT HIS LIPS SHALL SPEAK
FOR A MYSTERIOUS POWER COMPELS HIS STEPS
AND LIFE IS STRONGER THAN HIS TREMBLING SOUL
NONE CAN REFUSE WHAT THE STARK FORCE DEMANDS
HER EYES ARE FIXED UPON HER MIGHTY AIM
NO CRY OR PRAYER CAN TURN HER FROM HER PATH
SHE HAS LEAPED AN ARROW FROM THE BOW OF GOD
HIS WORDS WERE THEIRS WHO LIVE UNFORCED TO GRIEVE
AND HELP BY CALM THE SWAYING WHEELS OF LIFE
AND THE LONG RESTLESSNESS OF TRANSIENT THINGS
AND THE TROUBLE AND PASSION OF THE UNQUIET WORLD
AS THOUGH HER OWN BOSOM WERE PIERCED THE MOTHER SAW
THE ANCIENT HUMAN SENTENCE STRIKE HER CHILD
HER SWEETNESS THAT DESERVED ANOTHER FATE
ONLY A LARGER MEASURE GIVEN OF TEARS
ASPIRING TO THE NATURE OF THE GODS
A MIND PROOF-ARMOURED MAILED IN MIGHTY THOUGHTS
A WILL ENTIRE COUCHANT BEHIND WISDOM'S SHIELD
THOUGH TO STILL HEAVENS OF KNOWLEDGE SHE HAD RISEN
THOUGH CALM AND WISE AND ASWAPATI'S QUEEN
HUMAN WAS SHE STILL AND OPENED HER DOORS TO GRIEF
THE STONY-EYED INJUSTICE SHE ACCUSED
OF THE MARBLE GODHEAD OF INFLEXIBLE LAW
NOR SOUGHT THE STRENGTH EXTREME ADVERSITY BRINGS
TO LIVES THAT STAND ERECT AND FRONT THE WORLD-POWER
HER HEART APPEALED AGAINST THE IMPARTIAL JUDGE
TAXED WITH PERVERSITY THE IMPERSONAL ONE
HER TRANQUIL SPIRIT SHE CALLED NOT TO HER AID
BUT AS A COMMON MAN BENEATH HIS LOAD
GROWS FAINT AND BREATHES HIS PAIN IN IGNORANT WORDS
SO NOW SHE ARRAIGNED THE WORLD'S IMPASSIVE WILL
428
WHAT STEALTHY DOOM HAS CREPT ACROSS HER PATH
EMERGING FROM THE DARK FOREST'S SULLEN HEART
WHAT EVIL THING STOOD SMILING BY THE WAY
AND WORE THE BEAUTY OF THE SHALWA BOY
PERHAPS HE CAME AN ENEMY FROM HER PAST
ARMED WITH A HIDDEN FORCE OF ANCIENT WRONGS
HIMSELF UNKNOWING AND SEIZED HER UNKNOWN
HERE DREADFULLY ENTANGLED LOVE AND HATE
MEET US BLIND WANDERERS MID THE PERILS OF TIME
OUR DAYS ARE LINKS OF A DISASTROUS CHAIN
NECESSITY AVENGES CASUAL STEPS
OLD CRUELTIES COME BACK UNRECOGNISED
THE GODS MAKE USE OF OUR FORGOTTEN DEEDS
YET ALL IN VAIN THE BITTER LAW WAS MADE
OUR OWN MINDS ARE THE JUSTICERS OF DOOM
FOR NOTHING HAVE WE LEARNED BUT STILL REPEAT
OUR STARK MISUSE OF SELF AND OTHERS' SOULS
THERE ARE DIRE ALCHEMIES OF THE HUMAN HEART
AND FALLEN FROM HIS ETHEREAL ELEMENT
LOVE DARKENS TO THE SPIRIT OF NETHER GODS
THE DREADFUL ANGEL ANGRY WITH HIS JOYS
WOUNDINGLY SWEET HE CANNOT YET FOREGO
IS PITILESS TO THE SOUL HIS GAZE DISARMED
HE VISITS WITH HIS OWN PANGS HIS QUIVERING PREY
FORCING US TO CLING ENAMOURED TO HIS GRIP
AS IF IN LOVE WITH OUR OWN AGONY
THIS IS ONE POIGNANT MISERY IN THE WORLD
AND GRIEF HAS OTHER LASSOES FOR OUR LIFE
OUR SYMPATHIES BECOME OUR TORTURERS
STRENGTH HAVE I MY OWN PUNISHMENT TO BEAR
KNOWING IT JUST BUT ON THIS EARTH PERPLEXED
SMITTEN IN THE SORROW OF SCOURGED AND HELPLESS THINGS
OFTEN IT FAINTS TO MEET OTHER SUFFERING EYES
WE ARE NOT AS THE GODS WHO KNOW NOT GRIEF
AND LOOK IMPASSIVE ON A SUFFERING WORLD
CALM THEY GAZE DOWN ON THE LITTLE HUMAN SCENE
429
AND THE SHORT-LIVED PASSION CROSSING MORTAL HEARTS
AN ANCIENT TALE OF WOE CAN MOVE US STILL
WE KEEP THE ACHE OF BREASTS THAT BREATHE NO MORE
WE ARE SHAKEN BY THE SIGHT OF HUMAN PAIN
AND SHARE THE MISERIES THAT OTHERS FEEL
OURS NOT THE PASSIONLESS LIDS THAT CANNOT AGE
TOO HARD FOR US IS HEAVEN'S INDIFFERENCE
OUR OWN TRAGEDIES ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR US
ALL PATHOS AND ALL SUFFERINGS WE MAKE OURS
WE HAVE SORROW FOR A GREATNESS PASSED AWAY
AND FEEL THE TOUCH OF TEARS IN MORTAL THINGS
EVEN A STRANGER'S ANGUISH RENDS MY HEART
AND THIS O NARAD IS MY WELL-LOVED CHILD
HIDE NOT FROM US OUR DOOM IF DOOM IS OURS
THIS IS THE WORST AN UNKNOWN FACE OF FATE
A TERROR OMINOUS MUTE FELT MORE THAN SEEN
BEHIND OUR SEAT BY DAY OUR COUCH BY NIGHT
A FATE LURKING IN THE SHADOW OF OUR HEARTS
THE ANGUISH OF THE UNSEEN THAT WAITS TO STRIKE
TO KNOW IS BEST HOWEVER HARD TO BEAR
THEN CRIED THE SAGE PIERCING THE MOTHER'S HEART
FORCING TO STEEL THE WILL OF SAVITRI
HIS WORDS SET FREE THE SPRING OF COSMIC FATE
THE GREAT GODS USE THE PAIN OF HUMAN HEARTS
AS A SHARP AXE TO HEW THEIR COSMIC ROAD
THEY SQUANDER LAVISHLY MEN'S BLOOD AND TEARS
FOR A MOMENT'S PURPOSE IN THEIR FATEFUL WORK
THIS COSMIC NATURE'S BALANCE IS NOT OURS
NOR THE MYSTIC MEASURE OF HER NEED AND USE
A SINGLE WORD LETS LOOSE VAST AGENCIES
A CASUAL ACT DETERMINES THE WORLD'S FATE
SO NOW HE SET FREE DESTINY IN THAT HOUR
THE TRUTH THOU HAST CLAIMED I GIVE TO THEE THE TRUTH
A MARVEL OF THE MEETING EARTH AND HEAVENS
IS HE WHOM SAVITRI HAS CHOSEN MID MEN
HIS FIGURE IS THE FRONT OF NATURE'S MARCH
430
HIS SINGLE BEING EXCELS THE WORKS OF TIME
A SAPPHIRE CUTTING FROM THE SLEEP OF HEAVEN
DELIGHTFUL IS THE SOUL OF SATYAVAN
A RAY OUT OF THE RAPTUROUS INFINITE
A SILENCE WAKING TO A HYMN OF JOY
A DIVINITY AND KINGLINESS GIRD HIS BROW
HIS EYES KEEP A MEMORY FROM A WORLD OF BLISS
AS BRILLIANT AS A LONELY MOON IN HEAVEN
GENTLE LIKE THE SWEET BUD THAT SPRING DESIRES
PURE LIKE A STREAM THAT KISSES SILENT BANKS
HE TAKES WITH BRIGHT SURPRISE SPIRIT AND SENSE
A LIVING KNOT OF GOLDEN PARADISE
A BLUE IMMENSE HE LEANS TO THE LONGING WORLD
TIME'S JOY BORROWED OUT OF ETERNITY
A STAR OF SPLENDOUR OR A ROSE OF BLISS
IN HIM SOUL AND NATURE EQUAL PRESENCES
BALANCE AND FUSE IN A WIDE HARMONY
THE HAPPY IN THEIR BRIGHT ETHER HAVE NOT HEARTS
MORE SWEET AND TRUE THAN THIS OF MORTAL MAKE
THAT TAKES ALL JOY AS THE WORLD'S NATIVE GIFT
AND TO ALL GIVES JOY AS THE WORLD'S NATURAL RIGHT
HIS SPEECH CARRIES A LIGHT OF INNER TRUTH
AND A LARGE-EYED COMMUNION WITH THE POWER
IN COMMON THINGS HAS MADE VEILLESS HIS MIND
A SEER IN EARTH-SHAPES OF GARBLESS DEITY
A TRANQUIL BREADTH OF SKY WINDLESS AND STILL
WATCHING THE WORLD LIKE A MIND OF UNPLUMBED THOUGHT
A SILENT SPACE MUSING AND LUMINOUS
UNCOVERED BY THE MORNING TO DELIGHT
A GREEN TANGLE OF TREES UPON A HAPPY HILL
MADE INTO A MURMURING NEST BY SOUTHERN WINDS
THESE ARE HIS IMAGES AND PARALLELS
HIS KIN IN BEAUTY AND IN DEPTH HIS PEERS
A WILL TO CLIMB LIFTS A DELIGHT TO LIVE
HEAVEN'S HEIGHT COMPANION OF EARTH-BEAUTY'S CHARM
AN ASPIRATION TO THE IMMORTALS' AIR
431
LAIN ON THE LAP OF MORTAL ECSTASY
HIS SWEETNESS AND HIS JOY ATTRACT ALL HEARTS
TO LIVE WITH HIS OWN IN A GLAD TENANCY
HIS STRENGTH IS LIKE A TOWER BUILT TO REACH HEAVEN
A GODHEAD QUARRIED FROM THE STONES OF LIFE
O LOSS IF DEATH INTO ITS ELEMENTS
OF WHICH HIS GRACIOUS ENVELOPE WAS BUILT
SHATTER THIS VASE BEFORE IT BREATHES ITS SWEETS
AS IF EARTH COULD NOT KEEP TOO LONG FROM HEAVEN
A TREASURE THUS UNIQUE LOANED BY THE GODS
A BEING SO RARE OF SO DIVINE A MAKE
IN ONE BRIEF YEAR WHEN THIS BRIGHT HOUR FLIES BACK
AND PERCHES CARELESS ON A BRANCH OF TIME
THIS SOVEREIGN GLORY ENDS HEAVEN LENT TO EARTH
THIS SPLENDOUR VANISHES FROM THE MORTAL'S SKY
HEAVEN'S GREATNESS CAME BUT WAS TOO GREAT TO STAY
TWELVE SWIFT-WINGED MONTHS ARE GIVEN TO HIM AND HER
THIS DAY RETURNING SATYAVAN MUST DIE
A LIGHTNING BRIGHT AND NUDE THE SENTENCE FELL
BUT THE QUEEN CRIED VAIN THEN CAN BE HEAVEN'S GRACE
HEAVEN MOCKS US WITH THE BRILLIANCE OF ITS GIFTS
FOR DEATH IS A CUPBEARER OF THE WINE
OF TOO BRIEF JOY HELD UP TO MORTAL LIPS
FOR A PASSIONATE MOMENT BY THE CARELESS GODS
BUT I REJECT THE GRACE AND THE MOCKERY
MOUNTING THY CAR GO FORTH O SAVITRI
AND TRAVEL ONCE MORE THROUGH THE PEOPLED LANDS
ALAS IN THE GREEN GLADNESS OF THE WOODS
THY HEART HAS STOOPED TO A MISLEADING CALL
CHOOSE ONCE AGAIN AND LEAVE THIS FATED HEAD
DEATH IS THE GARDENER OF THIS WONDER-TREE
LOVE'S SWEETNESS SLEEPS IN HIS PALE MARBLE HAND
ADVANCING IN A HONEYED LINE BUT CLOSED
A LITTLE JOY WOULD BUY TOO BITTER AN END
PLEAD NOT THY CHOICE FOR DEATH HAS MADE IT VAIN
THY YOUTH AND RADIANCE WERE NOT BORN TO LIE
432
A CASKET VOID DROPPED ON A CARELESS SOIL
A CHOICE LESS RARE MAY CALL A HAPPIER FATE
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED FROM HER VIOLENT HEART
HER VOICE WAS CALM HER FACE WAS FIXED LIKE STEEL
ONCE MY HEART CHOSE AND CHOOSES NOT AGAIN
THE WORD I HAVE SPOKEN CAN NEVER BE ERASED
IT IS WRITTEN IN THE RECORD BOOK OF GOD
THE TRUTH ONCE UTTERED FROM THE EARTH'S AIR EFFACED
BY MIND FORGOTTEN SOUNDS IMMORTALLY
FOR EVER IN THE MEMORY OF TIME
ONCE THE DICE FALL THROWN BY THE HAND OF FATE
IN AN ETERNAL MOMENT OF THE GODS
MY HEART HAS SEALED ITS TROTH TO SATYAVAN
ITS SIGNATURE ADVERSE FATE CANNOT EFFACE
ITS SEAL NOT FATE NOR DEATH NOR TIME DISSOLVE
THOSE WHO SHALL PART WHO HAVE GROWN ONE BEING WITHIN
DEATH'S GRIP CAN BREAK OUR BODIES NOT OUR SOULS
IF DEATH TAKE HIM I TOO KNOW HOW TO DIE
LET FATE DO WITH ME WHAT SHE WILL OR CAN
I AM STRONGER THAN DEATH AND GREATER THAN MY FATE
MY LOVE SHALL OUTLAST THE WORLD DOOM FALLS FROM ME
HELPLESS AGAINST MY IMMORTALITY
FATE'S LAW MAY CHANGE BUT NOT MY SPIRIT'S WILL
AN ADAMANT WILL SHE CAST HER SPEECH LIKE BRONZE
BUT IN THE QUEEN'S MIND LISTENING HER WORDS
RANG LIKE THE VOICE OF A SELF-CHOSEN DOOM
DENYING EVERY ISSUE OF ESCAPE
TO HER OWN DESPAIR ANSWER THE MOTHER MADE
AS ONE SHE CRIED WHO IN HER HEAVY HEART
LABOURS AMID THE SOBBING OF HER HOPES
TO WAKE A NOTE OF HELP FROM SADDER STRINGS
O CHILD IN THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THY SOUL
DWELLING ON THE BORDER OF A GREATER WORLD
AND DAZZLED BY THY SUPERHUMAN THOUGHTS
THOU LENDST ETERNITY TO A MORTAL HOPE
HERE ON THIS MUTABLE AND IGNORANT EARTH
433
WHO IS THE LOVER AND WHO IS THE FRIEND
ALL PASSES HERE NOTHING REMAINS THE SAME
NONE IS FOR ANY ON THIS TRANSIENT GLOBE
HE WHOM THOU LOVEST NOW A STRANGER CAME
AND INTO A FAR STRANGENESS SHALL DEPART
HIS MOMENT'S PART ONCE DONE UPON LIFE'S STAGE
WHICH FOR A TIME WAS GIVEN HIM FROM WITHIN
TO OTHER SCENES HE MOVES AND OTHER PLAYERS
AND LAUGHS AND WEEPS MID FACES NEW UNKNOWN
THE BODY THOU HAST LOVED IS CAST AWAY
AMIDST THE BRUTE UNCHANGING STUFF OF WORLDS
TO INDIFFERENT MIGHTY NATURE AND BECOMES
CRUDE MATTER FOR THE JOY OF OTHERS' LIVES
BUT FOR OUR SOULS UPON THE WHEEL OF GOD
FOR EVER TURNING THEY ARRIVE AND GO
MARRIED AND SUNDERED IN THE MAGIC ROUND
OF THE GREAT DANCER OF THE BOUNDLESS DANCE
OUR EMOTIONS ARE BUT HIGH AND DYING NOTES
OF HIS WILD MUSIC CHANGED COMPELLINGLY
BY THE PASSIONATE MOVEMENTS OF A SEEKING HEART
IN THE INCONSTANT LINKS OF HOUR WITH HOUR
TO CALL DOWN HEAVEN'S DISTANT ANSWERING SONG
TO CRY TO AN UNSEIZED BLISS IS ALL WE DARE
ONCE SEIZED WE LOSE THE HEAVENLY MUSIC'S SENSE
TOO NEAR THE RHYTHMIC CRY HAS FLED OR FAILED
ALL SWEETNESSES ARE BAFFLING SYMBOLS HERE
LOVE DIES BEFORE THE LOVER IN OUR BREAST
OUR JOYS ARE PERFUMES IN A BRITTLE VASE
O THEN WHAT WRECK IS THIS UPON TIME'S SEA
TO SPREAD LIFE'S SAILS TO THE HURRICANE DESIRE
AND CALL FOR PILOT THE UNSEEING HEART
O CHILD WILT THOU PROCLAIM WILT THOU THEN FOLLOW
AGAINST THE LAW THAT IS THE ETERNAL WILL
THE AUTARCHY OF THE RASH TITAN'S MOOD
TO WHOM HIS OWN FIERCE WILL IS THE ONE LAW
IN A WORLD WHERE TRUTH IS NOT NOR LIGHT NOR GOD
434
ONLY THE GODS CAN SPEAK WHAT NOW THOU SPEAKST
THOU WHO ART HUMAN THINK NOT LIKE A GOD
FOR MAN BELOW THE GOD ABOVE THE BRUTE
IS GIVEN THE CALM REASON AS HIS GUIDE
HE IS NOT DRIVEN BY AN UNTHINKING WILL
AS ARE THE ACTIONS OF THE BIRD AND BEAST
HE IS NOT MOVED BY STARK NECESSITY
LIKE THE SENSELESS MOTION OF INCONSCIENT THINGS
THE GIANT'S AND THE TITAN'S FURIOUS MARCH
CLIMBS TO USURP THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS
OR SKIRTS THE DEMON MAGNITUDES OF HELL
IN THE UNREFLECTING PASSION OF THEIR HEARTS
THEY DASH THEIR LIVES AGAINST THE ETERNAL LAW
AND FALL AND BREAK BY THEIR OWN VIOLENT MASS
THE MIDDLE PATH IS MADE FOR THINKING MAN
TO CHOOSE HIS STEPS BY REASON'S VIGILANT LIGHT
TO CHOOSE HIS PATH AMONG THE MANY PATHS
IS GIVEN HIM FOR EACH HIS DIFFICULT GOAL
HEWN OUT OF INFINITE POSSIBILITY
LEAVE NOT THY GOAL TO FOLLOW A BEAUTIFUL FACE
ONLY WHEN THOU HAST CLIMBED ABOVE THY MIND
AND LIV'ST IN THE CALM VASTNESS OF THE ONE
CAN LOVE BE ETERNAL IN THE ETERNAL BLISS
AND LOVE DIVINE REPLACE THE HUMAN TIE
THERE IS A SHROUDED LAW AN AUSTERE FORCE
IT BIDS THEE STRENGTHEN THY UNDYING SPIRIT
IT OFFERS ITS SEVERE BENIGNANCIES
OF WORK AND THOUGHT AND MEASURED GRAVE DELIGHT
AS STEPS TO CLIMB TO GOD'S FAR SECRET HEIGHTS
THEN IS OUR LIFE A TRANQUIL PILGRIMAGE
EACH YEAR A MILE UPON THE HEAVENLY WAY
EACH DAWN OPENS INTO A LARGER LIGHT
THY ACTS ARE THY HELPERS ALL EVENTS ARE SIGNS
WAKING AND SLEEP ARE OPPORTUNITIES
GIVEN TO THEE BY AN IMMORTAL POWER
SO CANST THOU RAISE THY PURE UNVANQUISHED SPIRIT
435
TILL SPREAD TO HEAVEN IN A WIDE VESPER CALM
INDIFFERENT AND GENTLE AS THE SKY
IT GREATENS SLOWLY INTO TIMELESS PEACE
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED WITH STEADFAST EYES
MY WILL IS PART OF THE ETERNAL WILL
MY FATE IS WHAT MY SPIRIT'S STRENGTH CAN MAKE
MY FATE IS WHAT MY SPIRIT'S STRENGTH CAN BEAR
MY STRENGTH IS NOT THE TITAN'S IT IS GOD'S
I HAVE DISCOVERED MY GLAD REALITY
BEYOND MY BODY IN ANOTHER'S BEING
I HAVE FOUND THE DEEP UNCHANGING SOUL OF LOVE
THEN HOW SHALL I DESIRE A LONELY GOOD
OR SLAY ASPIRING TO WHITE VACANT PEACE
THE ENDLESS HOPE THAT MADE MY SOUL SPRING FORTH
OUT OF ITS INFINITE SOLITUDE AND SLEEP
MY SPIRIT HAS GLIMPSED THE GLORY FOR WHICH IT CAME
THE BEATING OF ONE VAST HEART IN THE FLAME OF THINGS
MY ETERNITY CLASPED BY HIS ETERNITY
AND TIRELESS OF THE SWEET ABYSMS OF TIME
DEEP POSSIBILITY ALWAYS TO LOVE
THIS THIS IS FIRST LAST JOY AND TO ITS THROB
THE RICHES OF A THOUSAND FORTUNATE YEARS
ARE POVERTY NOTHING TO ME ARE DEATH AND GRIEF
OR ORDINARY LIVES AND HAPPY DAYS
AND WHAT TO ME ARE COMMON SOULS OF MEN
OR EYES AND LIPS THAT ARE NOT SATYAVAN'S
I HAVE NO NEED TO DRAW BACK FROM HIS ARMS
AND THE DISCOVERED PARADISE OF HIS LOVE
AND JOURNEY INTO A STILL INFINITY
ONLY NOW FOR MY SOUL IN SATYAVAN
I TREASURE THE RICH OCCASION OF MY BIRTH
IN SUNLIGHT AND A DREAM OF EMERALD WAYS
I SHALL WALK WITH HIM LIKE GODS IN PARADISE
IF FOR A YEAR THAT YEAR IS ALL MY LIFE
AND YET I KNOW THIS IS NOT ALL MY FATE
ONLY TO LIVE AND LOVE AWHILE AND DIE
436
FOR I KNOW NOW WHY MY SPIRIT CAME ON EARTH
AND WHO I AM AND WHO HE IS I LOVE
I HAVE LOOKED AT HIM FROM MY IMMORTAL SELF
I HAVE SEEN GOD SMILE AT ME IN SATYAVAN
I HAVE SEEN THE ETERNAL IN A HUMAN FACE
THEN NONE COULD ANSWER TO HER WORDS SILENT
THEY SAT AND LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF FATE
437
A SILENCE SEALED THE IRREVOCABLE DECREE
THE WORD OF FATE THAT FELL FROM HEAVENLY LIPS
FIXING A DOOM NO POWER COULD EVER REVERSE
UNLESS HEAVEN'S WILL ITSELF COULD CHANGE ITS COURSE
OR SO IT SEEMED YET FROM THE SILENCE ROSE
ONE VOICE THAT QUESTIONED CHANGELESS DESTINY
A WILL THAT STROVE AGAINST THE IMMUTABLE WILL
A MOTHER'S HEART HAD HEARD THE FATEFUL SPEECH
THAT RANG LIKE A SANCTION TO THE CALL OF DEATH
AND CAME LIKE A CHILL CLOSE TO LIFE AND HOPE
YET HOPE SANK DOWN LIKE AN EXTINGUISHED FIRE
SHE FELT THE LEADEN INEVITABLE HAND
INVADE THE SECRECY OF HER GUARDED SOUL
AND SMITE WITH SUDDEN PAIN ITS STILL CONTENT
AND THE EMPIRE OF HER HARD-WON QUIETUDE
AWHILE SHE FELL TO THE LEVEL OF HUMAN MIND
A FIELD OF MORTAL GRIEF AND NATURE'S LAW
SHE SHARED SHE BORE THE COMMON LOT OF MEN
AND FELT WHAT COMMON HEARTS ENDURE IN TIME
VOICING EARTH'S QUESTION TO THE INSCRUTABLE POWER
THE QUEEN NOW TURNED TO THE STILL IMMOBILE SEER
ASSAILED BY THE DISCONTENT IN NATURE'S DEPTHS
PARTNER IN THE AGONY OF DUMB DRIVEN THINGS
AND ALL THE MISERY ALL THE IGNORANT CRY
PASSIONATE LIKE SORROW QUESTIONING HEAVEN SHE SPOKE
LENDING HER SPEECH TO THE SURFACE SOUL ON EARTH
SHE UTTERED THE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD'S DUMB HEART
AND MAN'S REVOLT AGAINST HIS IGNORANT FATE
O SEER IN THE EARTH'S STRANGE TWI-NATURED LIFE
BY WHAT PITILESS ADVERSE NECESSITY
OR WHAT COLD FREAK OF A CREATOR'S WILL
438
BY WHAT RANDOM ACCIDENT OR GOVERNED CHANCE
THAT SHAPED A RULE OUT OF FORTUITOUS STEPS
MADE DESTINY FROM AN HOUR'S EMOTION CAME
INTO THE UNREADABLE MYSTERY OF TIME
THE DIRER MYSTERY OF GRIEF AND PAIN
IS IT THY GOD WHO MADE THIS CRUEL LAW
OR SOME DISASTROUS POWER HAS MARRED HIS WORK
AND HE STANDS HELPLESS TO DEFEND OR SAVE
A FATAL SEED WAS SOWN IN LIFE'S FALSE START
WHEN EVIL TWINNED WITH GOOD ON EARTHLY SOIL
THEN FIRST APPEARED THE MALADY OF MIND
ITS PANG OF THOUGHT ITS QUEST FOR THE AIM OF LIFE
IT TWISTED INTO FORMS OF GOOD AND ILL
THE FRANK SIMPLICITY OF THE ANIMAL'S ACTS
IT TURNED THE STRAIGHT PATH HEWN BY THE BODY'S GODS
FOLLOWED THE ZIGZAG OF THE UNCERTAIN COURSE
OF LIFE THAT WANDERS SEEKING FOR ITS AIM
IN THE PALE STARLIGHT FALLING FROM THOUGHT'S SKIES
ITS GUIDES THE UNSURE IDEA THE WAVERING WILL
LOST WAS THE INSTINCT'S SAFE IDENTITY
WITH THE ARROW-POINT OF BEING'S INMOST SIGHT
MARRED THE SURE STEPS OF NATURE'S SIMPLE WALK
AND TRUTH AND FREEDOM IN THE GROWING SOUL
OUT OF SOME AGELESS INNOCENCE AND PEACE
PRIVILEGE OF SOULS NOT YET BETRAYED TO BIRTH
CAST DOWN TO SUFFER ON THIS HARD DANGEROUS EARTH
OUR LIFE WAS BORN IN PAIN AND WITH A CRY
ALTHOUGH EARTH-NATURE WELCOMES HEAVEN'S BREATH
INSPIRING MATTER WITH THE WILL TO LIVE
A THOUSAND ILLS ASSAIL THE MORTAL'S HOURS
AND WEAR AWAY THE NATURAL JOY OF LIFE
OUR BODIES ARE AN ENGINE CUNNINGLY MADE
BUT FOR ALL ITS PARTS AS CUNNINGLY ARE PLANNED
CONTRIVED INGENIOUSLY WITH DEMON SKILL
ITS APT INEVITABLE HERITAGE
OF MORTAL DANGER AND PECULIAR PAIN
439
ITS PAYMENT OF THE TAX OF TIME AND FATE
ITS WAY TO SUFFER AND ITS WAY TO DIE
THIS IS THE RANSOM OF OUR HIGH ESTATE
THE SIGN AND STAMP OF OUR HUMANITY
A GRISLY COMPANY OF MALADIES
COME LICENSED LODGERS INTO MAN'S BODILY HOUSE
PURVEYORS OF DEATH AND TORTURERS OF LIFE
IN THE MALIGNANT HOLLOWS OF THE WORLD
IN ITS SUBCONSCIENT CAVERN-PASSAGES
AMBUSHED THEY LIE WAITING THEIR HOUR TO LEAP
SURROUNDING WITH DANGER THE SIEGED CITY OF LIFE
ADMITTED INTO THE CITADEL OF MAN'S DAYS
THEY MINE HIS FORCE AND MAIM OR SUDDENLY KILL
OURSELVES WITHIN US LETHAL FORCES NURSE
WE MAKE OF OUR OWN ENEMIES OUR GUESTS
OUT OF THEIR HOLES LIKE BEASTS THEY CREEP AND GNAW
THE CHORDS OF THE DIVINE MUSICIAN'S LYRE
TILL FRAYED AND THIN THE MUSIC DIES AWAY
OR CRASHING SNAPS WITH A LAST TRAGIC NOTE
ALL THAT WE ARE IS LIKE A FORT BESET
ALL THAT WE STRIVE TO BE ALTERS LIKE A DREAM
IN THE GREY SLEEP OF MATTER'S IGNORANCE
MIND SUFFERS LAMED BY THE WORLD'S DISHARMONY
AND THE UNLOVELINESS OF HUMAN THINGS
A TREASURE MISSPENT OR CHEAPLY FRUITLESSLY SOLD
IN THE BAZAAR OF A BLIND DESTINY
A GIFT OF PRICELESS VALUE FROM TIME'S GODS
LOST OR MISLAID IN AN UNCARING WORLD
LIFE IS A MARVEL MISSED AN ART GONE WRY
A SEEKER IN A DARK AND OBSCURE PLACE
AN ILL-ARMED WARRIOR FACING DREADFUL ODDS
AN IMPERFECT WORKER GIVEN A BAFFLING TASK
AN IGNORANT JUDGE OF PROBLEMS IGNORANCE MADE
ITS HEAVENWARD FLIGHTS REACH CLOSED AND KEYLESS GATES
ITS GLORIOUS OUTBURSTS PETER OUT IN MIRE
ON NATURE'S GIFTS TO MAN A CURSE WAS LAID
440
ALL WALKS INARMED BY ITS OWN OPPOSITES
ERROR IS THE COMRADE OF OUR MORTAL THOUGHT
AND FALSEHOOD LURKS IN THE DEEP BOSOM OF TRUTH
SIN POISONS WITH ITS VIVID FLOWERS OF JOY
OR LEAVES A RED SCAR BURNT ACROSS THE SOUL
VIRTUE IS A GREY BONDAGE AND A GAOL
AT EVERY STEP IS LAID FOR US A SNARE
ALIEN TO REASON AND THE SPIRIT'S LIGHT
OUR FOUNT OF ACTION FROM A DARKNESS WELLS
IN IGNORANCE AND NESCIENCE ARE OUR ROOTS
A GROWING REGISTER OF CALAMITIES
IS THE PAST'S ACCOUNT THE FUTURE'S BOOK OF FATE
THE CENTURIES PILE MAN'S FOLLIES AND MAN'S CRIMES
UPON THE COUNTLESS CROWD OF NATURE'S ILLS
AS IF THE WORLD'S STONE LOAD WAS NOT ENOUGH
A CROP OF MISERIES OBSTINATELY IS SOWN
BY HIS OWN HAND IN THE FURROWS OF THE GODS
THE VAST INCREASING TRAGIC HARVEST REAPED
FROM OLD MISDEEDS BURIED BY OBLIVIOUS TIME
HE WALKS BY HIS OWN CHOICE INTO HELL'S TRAP
THIS MORTAL CREATURE IS HIS OWN WORST FOE
HIS SCIENCE IS AN ARTIFICER OF DOOM
HE RANSACKS EARTH FOR MEANS TO HARM HIS KIND
HE SLAYS HIS HAPPINESS AND OTHERS' GOOD
NOTHING HAS HE LEARNED FROM TIME AND ITS HISTORY
EVEN AS OF OLD IN THE RAW YOUTH OF TIME
WHEN EARTH IGNORANT RAN ON THE HIGHWAYS OF FATE
OLD FORMS OF EVIL CLING TO THE WORLD'S SOUL
WAR MAKING NOUGHT THE SWEET SMILING CALM OF LIFE
BATTLE AND RAPINE RUIN AND MASSACRE
ARE STILL THE FIERCE PASTIMES OF MAN'S WARRING TRIBES
AN IDIOT HOUR DESTROYS WHAT CENTURIES MADE
HIS WANTON RAGE OR FRENZIED HATE LAYS LOW
THE BEAUTY AND GREATNESS BY HIS GENIUS WROUGHT
AND THE MIGHTY OUTPUT OF A NATION'S TOIL
ALL HE HAS ACHIEVED HE DRAGS TO THE PRECIPICE
441
HIS GRANDEUR HE TURNS TO AN EPIC OF DOOM AND FALL
HIS LITTLENESS CRAWLS CONTENT THROUGH SQUALOR AND MUD
HE CALLS HEAVEN'S RETRIBUTION ON HIS HEAD
AND WALLOWS IN HIS SELF-MADE MISERY
A PART AUTHOR OF THE COSMIC TRAGEDY
HIS WILL CONSPIRES WITH DEATH AND TIME AND FATE
HIS BRIEF APPEARANCE ON THE ENIGMAED EARTH
EVER RECURS BUT BRINGS NO HIGH RESULT
TO THIS WANDERER THROUGH THE AEON-RINGS OF GOD
THAT SHUT HIS LIFE IN THEIR VAST LONGEVITY
HIS SOUL'S WIDE SEARCH AND EVER RETURNING HOPES
PURSUE THE USELESS ORBIT OF THEIR COURSE
IN A VAIN REPETITION OF LOST TOILS
ACROSS A TRACK OF SOON FORGOTTEN LIVES
ALL IS AN EPISODE IN A MEANINGLESS TALE
WHY IS IT ALL AND WHEREFORE ARE WE HERE
IF TO SOME BEING OF ETERNAL BLISS
IT IS OUR SPIRIT'S DESTINY TO RETURN
OR SOME STILL IMPERSONAL HEIGHT OF ENDLESS CALM
SINCE THAT WE ARE AND OUT OF THAT WE CAME
WHENCE ROSE THE STRANGE AND STERILE INTERLUDE
LASTING IN VAIN THROUGH INTERMINABLE TIME
WHO WILLED TO FORM OR FEIGN A UNIVERSE
IN THE COLD AND ENDLESS EMPTINESS OF SPACE
OR IF THESE BEINGS MUST BE AND THEIR BRIEF LIVES
WHAT NEED HAD THE SOUL OF IGNORANCE AND TEARS
WHENCE ROSE THE CALL FOR SORROW AND FOR PAIN
OR ALL CAME HELPLESSLY WITHOUT A CAUSE
WHAT POWER FORCED THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT TO BIRTH
THE ETERNAL WITNESS ONCE OF ETERNITY
A DEATHLESS SOJOURNER MID TRANSIENT SCENES
HE CAMPS IN LIFE'S HALF-LIT OBSCURITY
AMID THE DEBRIS OF HIS THOUGHTS AND DREAMS
OR WHO PERSUADED IT TO FALL FROM BLISS
AND FORFEIT ITS IMMORTAL PRIVILEGE
WHO LAID ON IT THE CEASELESS WILL TO LIVE
442
A WANDERER IN THIS BEAUTIFUL SORROWFUL WORLD
AND BEAR ITS LOAD OF JOY AND GRIEF AND LOVE
OR IF NO BEING WATCHES THE WORKS OF TIME
WHAT HARD IMPERSONAL NECESSITY
COMPELS THE VAIN TOIL OF BRIEF LIVING THINGS
A GREAT ILLUSION THEN HAS BUILT THE STARS
BUT WHERE THEN IS THE SOUL'S SECURITY
ITS POISE IN THIS CIRCLING OF UNREAL SUNS
OR ELSE IT IS A WANDERER FROM ITS HOME
WHO STRAYED INTO A BLIND ALLEY OF TIME AND CHANCE
AND FINDS NO ISSUE FROM A MEANINGLESS WORLD
OR WHERE BEGINS AND ENDS ILLUSION'S REIGN
PERHAPS THE SOUL WE FEEL IS ONLY A DREAM
ETERNAL SELF A FICTION SENSED IN TRANCE
THEN AFTER A SILENCE NARAD MADE REPLY
TUNING HIS LIPS TO EARTHLY SOUND HE SPOKE
AND SOMETHING NOW OF THE DEEP SENSE OF FATE
WEIGHTED THE FRAGILE HINTS OF MORTAL SPEECH
HIS FOREHEAD SHONE WITH VISION SOLEMNISED
TURNED TO A TABLET OF SUPERNAL THOUGHTS
AS IF CHARACTERS OF AN UNWRITTEN TONGUE
HAD LEFT IN ITS BREADTH THE INSCRIPTIONS OF THE GODS
BARE IN THAT LIGHT TIME TOILED HIS UNSEEN WORKS
DETECTED THE BROAD-FLUNG FAR-SEEING SCHEMES
UNFINISHED WHICH HIS AEONED FLIGHT UNROLLS
WERE MAPPED ALREADY IN THAT WORLD-WIDE LOOK
WAS THEN THE SUN A DREAM BECAUSE THERE IS NIGHT
HIDDEN IN THE MORTAL'S HEART THE ETERNAL LIVES
HE LIVES SECRET IN THE CHAMBER OF THY SOUL
A LIGHT SHINES THERE NOR PAIN NOR GRIEF CAN CROSS
A DARKNESS STANDS BETWEEN THYSELF AND HIM
THOU CANST NOT HEAR OR FEEL THE MARVELLOUS GUEST
THOU CANST NOT SEE THE BEATIFIC SUN
O QUEEN THY THOUGHT IS A LIGHT OF THE IGNORANCE
ITS BRILLIANT CURTAIN HIDES FROM THEE GOD'S FACE
443
IT ILLUMES A WORLD BORN FROM THE INCONSCIENCE
BUT HIDES THE IMMORTAL'S MEANING IN THE WORLD
THY MIND'S LIGHT HIDES FROM THEE THE ETERNAL'S THOUGHT
THY HEART'S HOPES HIDE FROM THEE THE ETERNAL'S WILL
EARTH'S JOYS SHUT FROM THEE THE IMMORTAL'S BLISS
THENCE ROSE THE NEED OF A DARK INTRUDING GOD
THE WORLD'S DREAD TEACHER THE CREATOR PAIN
WHERE IGNORANCE IS THERE SUFFERING TOO MUST COME
THY GRIEF IS A CRY OF DARKNESS TO THE LIGHT
PAIN WAS THE FIRST-BORN OF THE INCONSCIENCE
WHICH WAS THY BODY'S DUMB ORIGINAL BASE
ALREADY SLEPT THERE PAIN'S SUBCONSCIENT SHAPE
A SHADOW IN A SHADOWY TENEBROUS WOMB
TILL LIFE SHALL MOVE IT WAITS TO WAKE AND BE
IN ONE CAUL WITH JOY CAME FORTH THE DREADFUL POWER
IN LIFE'S BREAST IT WAS BORN HIDING ITS TWIN
BUT PAIN CAME FIRST THEN ONLY JOY COULD BE
PAIN PLOUGHED THE FIRST HARD GROUND OF THE WORLD-DROWSE
BY PAIN A SPIRIT STARTED FROM THE CLOD
BY PAIN LIFE STIRRED IN THE SUBLIMINAL DEEP
INTERNED SUBMERGED HIDDEN IN MATTER'S TRANCE
AWOKE TO ITSELF THE DREAMER SLEEPING MIND
IT MADE A VISIBLE REALM OUT OF ITS DREAMS
IT DREW ITS SHAPES FROM THE SUBCONSCIENT DEPTHS
THEN TURNED TO LOOK UPON THE WORLD IT HAD MADE
BY PAIN AND JOY THE BRIGHT AND TENEBROUS TWINS
THE INANIMATE WORLD PERCEIVED ITS SENTIENT SOUL
ELSE HAD THE INCONSCIENT NEVER SUFFERED CHANGE
PAIN IS THE HAMMER OF THE GODS TO BREAK
A DEAD RESISTANCE IN THE MORTAL'S HEART
HIS SLOW INERTIA AS OF LIVING STONE
IF THE HEART WERE NOT FORCED TO WANT AND WEEP
HIS SOUL WOULD HAVE LAIN DOWN CONTENT AT EASE
AND NEVER THOUGHT TO EXCEED THE HUMAN START
AND NEVER LEARNED TO CLIMB TOWARDS THE SUN
THIS EARTH IS FULL OF LABOUR PACKED WITH PAIN
444
THROES OF AN ENDLESS BIRTH COERCE HER STILL
THE CENTURIES END THE AGES VAINLY PASS
AND YET THE GODHEAD IN HER IS NOT BORN
THE ANCIENT MOTHER FACES ALL WITH JOY
CALLS FOR THE ARDENT PANG THE GRANDIOSE THRILL
FOR WITH PAIN AND LABOUR ALL CREATION COMES
THIS EARTH IS FULL OF THE ANGUISH OF THE GODS
EVER THEY TRAVAIL DRIVEN BY TIME'S GOAD
AND STRIVE TO WORK OUT THE ETERNAL WILL
AND SHAPE THE LIFE DIVINE IN MORTAL FORMS
HIS WILL MUST BE WORKED OUT IN HUMAN BREASTS
AGAINST THE EVIL THAT RISES FROM THE GULFS
AGAINST THE WORLD'S IGNORANCE AND ITS OBSTINATE STRENGTH
AGAINST THE STUMBLINGS OF MAN'S PERVERT WILL
AGAINST THE DEEP FOLLY OF HIS HUMAN MIND
AGAINST THE BLIND RELUCTANCE OF HIS HEART
THE SPIRIT IS DOOMED TO PAIN TILL MAN IS FREE
THERE IS A CLAMOUR OF BATTLE A TRAMP A MARCH
A CRY ARISES LIKE A MOANING SEA
A DESPERATE LAUGHTER UNDER THE BLOWS OF DEATH
A DOOM OF BLOOD AND SWEAT AND TOIL AND TEARS
MEN DIE THAT MAN MAY LIVE AND GOD BE BORN
AN AWFUL SILENCE WATCHES TRAGIC TIME
PAIN IS THE HAND OF NATURE SCULPTURING MEN
TO GREATNESS AN INSPIRED LABOUR CHISELS
WITH HEAVENLY CRUELTY AN UNWILLING MOULD
IMPLACABLE IN THE PASSION OF THEIR WILL
LIFTING THE HAMMERS OF TITANIC TOIL
THE DEMIURGES OF THE UNIVERSE WORK
THEY SHAPE WITH GIANT STROKES THEIR OWN THEIR SONS
ARE MARKED WITH THEIR ENORMOUS STAMP OF FIRE
ALTHOUGH THE SHAPING GOD'S TREMENDOUS TOUCH
IS TORTURE UNBEARABLE TO MORTAL NERVES
THE FIERY SPIRIT GROWS IN STRENGTH WITHIN
AND FEELS A JOY IN EVERY TITAN PANG
HE WHO WOULD SAVE HIMSELF LIVES BARE AND CALM
445
HE WHO WOULD SAVE THE RACE MUST SHARE ITS PAIN
THIS HE SHALL KNOW WHO OBEYS THAT GRANDIOSE URGE
THE GREAT WHO CAME TO SAVE THIS SUFFERING WORLD
AND RESCUE OUT OF TIME'S SHADOW AND THE LAW
MUST PASS BENEATH THE YOKE OF GRIEF AND PAIN
THEY ARE CAUGHT BY THE WHEEL THAT THEY HAD HOPED TO BREAK
ON THEIR SHOULDERS THEY MUST BEAR MAN'S LOAD OF FATE
HEAVEN'S RICHES THEY BRING THEIR SUFFERINGS COUNT THE PRICE
OR THEY PAY THE GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THEIR LIVES
THE SON OF GOD BORN AS THE SON OF MAN
HAS DRUNK THE BITTER CUP OWNED GODHEAD'S DEBT
THE DEBT THE ETERNAL OWES TO THE FALLEN KIND
HIS WILL HAS BOUND TO DEATH AND STRUGGLING LIFE
THAT YEARNS IN VAIN FOR REST AND ENDLESS PEACE
NOW IS THE DEBT PAID WIPED OFF THE ORIGINAL SCORE
THE ETERNAL SUFFERS IN A HUMAN FORM
HE HAS SIGNED SALVATION'S TESTAMENT WITH HIS BLOOD
HE HAS OPENED THE DOORS OF HIS UNDYING PEACE
THE DEITY COMPENSATES THE CREATURE'S CLAIM
THE CREATOR BEARS THE LAW OF PAIN AND DEATH
A RETRIBUTION SMITES THE INCARNATE GOD
HIS LOVE HAS PAVED THE MORTAL'S ROAD TO HEAVEN
HE HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE AND LIGHT TO BALANCE HERE
THE DARK ACCOUNT OF MORTAL IGNORANCE
IT IS FINISHED THE DREAD MYSTERIOUS SACRIFICE
OFFERED BY GOD'S MARTYRED BODY FOR THE WORLD
GETHSEMANE AND CALVARY ARE HIS LOT
HE CARRIES THE CROSS ON WHICH MAN'S SOUL IS NAILED
HIS ESCORT IS THE CURSES OF THE CROWD
INSULT AND JEER ARE HIS RIGHT'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT
TWO THIEVES SLAIN WITH HIM MOCK HIS MIGHTY DEATH
HE HAS TROD WITH BLEEDING BROW THE SAVIOUR'S WAY
HE WHO HAS FOUND HIS IDENTITY WITH GOD
PAYS WITH THE BODY'S DEATH HIS SOUL'S VAST LIGHT
HIS KNOWLEDGE IMMORTAL TRIUMPHS BY HIS DEATH
HEWN QUARTERED ON THE SCAFFOLD AS HE FALLS
446
HIS CRUCIFIED VOICE PROCLAIMS 'I I AM GOD'
'YES ALL IS GOD' PEALS BACK HEAVEN'S DEATHLESS CALL
THE SEED OF GODHEAD SLEEPS IN MORTAL HEARTS
THE FLOWER OF GODHEAD GROWS ON THE WORLD-TREE
ALL SHALL DISCOVER GOD IN SELF AND THINGS
BUT WHEN GOD'S MESSENGER COMES TO HELP THE WORLD
AND LEAD THE SOUL OF EARTH TO HIGHER THINGS
HE TOO MUST CARRY THE YOKE HE CAME TO UNLOOSE
HE TOO MUST BEAR THE PANG THAT HE WOULD HEAL
EXEMPT AND UNAFFLICTED BY EARTH'S FATE
HOW SHALL HE CURE THE ILLS HE NEVER FELT
HE COVERS THE WORLD'S AGONY WITH HIS CALM
BUT THOUGH TO THE OUTWARD EYE NO SIGN APPEARS
AND PEACE IS GIVEN TO OUR TORN HUMAN HEARTS
THE STRUGGLE IS THERE AND PAID THE UNSEEN PRICE
THE FIRE THE STRIFE THE WRESTLE ARE WITHIN
HE CARRIES THE SUFFERING WORLD IN HIS OWN BREAST
ITS SINS WEIGH ON HIS THOUGHTS ITS GRIEF IS HIS
EARTH'S ANCIENT LOAD LIES HEAVY ON HIS SOUL
NIGHT AND ITS POWERS BELEAGUER HIS TARDY STEPS
THE TITAN ADVERSARY'S CLUTCH HE BEARS
HIS MARCH IS A BATTLE AND A PILGRIMAGE
LIFE'S EVIL SMITES HE IS STRICKEN WITH THE WORLD'S PAIN
A MILLION WOUNDS GAPE IN HIS SECRET HEART
HE JOURNEYS SLEEPLESS THROUGH AN UNENDING NIGHT
ANTAGONIST FORCES CROWD ACROSS HIS PATH
A SIEGE A COMBAT IS HIS INNER LIFE
EVEN WORSE MAY BE THE COST DIRER THE PAIN
HIS LARGE IDENTITY AND ALL-HARBOURING LOVE
SHALL BRING THE COSMIC ANGUISH INTO HIS DEPTHS
THE SORROW OF ALL LIVING THINGS SHALL COME
AND KNOCK AT HIS DOORS AND LIVE WITHIN HIS HOUSE
A DREADFUL CORD OF SYMPATHY CAN TIE
ALL SUFFERING INTO HIS SINGLE GRIEF AND MAKE
ALL AGONY IN ALL THE WORLDS HIS OWN
HE MEETS AN ANCIENT ADVERSARY FORCE
447
HE IS LASHED WITH THE WHIPS THAT TEAR THE WORLD'S WORN HEART
THE WEEPING OF THE CENTURIES VISITS HIS EYES
HE WEARS THE BLOOD-GLUED FIERY CENTAUR SHIRT
THE POISON OF THE WORLD HAS STAINED HIS THROAT
IN THE MARKET-PLACE OF MATTER'S CAPITAL
AMIDST THE CHAFFERINGS OF THE AFFAIR CALLED LIFE
HE IS TIED TO THE STAKE OF A PERENNIAL FIRE
HE BURNS ON AN UNSEEN ORIGINAL VERGE
THAT MATTER MAY BE TURNED TO SPIRIT STUFF
HE IS THE VICTIM IN HIS OWN SACRIFICE
THE IMMORTAL BOUND TO EARTH'S MORTALITY
APPEARING AND PERISHING ON THE ROADS OF TIME
CREATES GOD'S MOMENT BY ETERNITY'S BEATS
HE DIES THAT THE WORLD MAY BE NEW-BORN AND LIVE
EVEN IF HE ESCAPES THE FIERCEST FIRES
EVEN IF THE WORLD BREAKS NOT IN A DROWNING SEA
ONLY BY HARD SACRIFICE IS HIGH HEAVEN EARNED
HE MUST FACE THE FIGHT THE PANG WHO WOULD CONQUER HELL
A DARK CONCEALED HOSTILITY IS LODGED
IN THE HUMAN DEPTHS IN THE HIDDEN HEART OF TIME
THAT CLAIMS THE RIGHT TO CHANGE AND MAR GOD'S WORK
A SECRET ENMITY AMBUSHES THE WORLD'S MARCH
IT LEAVES A MARK ON THOUGHT AND SPEECH AND ACT
IT STAMPS STAIN AND DEFECT ON ALL THINGS DONE
TILL IT IS SLAIN PEACE IS FORBIDDEN ON EARTH
THERE IS NO VISIBLE FOE BUT THE UNSEEN
IS ROUND US FORCES INTANGIBLE BESIEGE
TOUCHES FROM ALIEN REALMS THOUGHTS NOT OUR OWN
OVERTAKE US AND COMPEL THE ERRING HEART
OUR LIVES ARE CAUGHT IN AN AMBIGUOUS NET
AN ADVERSARY FORCE WAS BORN OF OLD
INVADER OF THE LIFE OF MORTAL MAN
IT HIDES FROM HIM THE STRAIGHT IMMORTAL PATH
A POWER CAME IN TO VEIL THE ETERNAL LIGHT
A POWER OPPOSED TO THE ETERNAL WILL
DIVERTS THE MESSAGES OF THE INFALLIBLE WORD
448
CONTORTS THE CONTOURS OF THE COSMIC PLAN
A WHISPER LURES TO EVIL THE HUMAN HEART
IT SEALS UP WISDOM'S EYES THE SOUL'S REGARD
IT IS THE ORIGIN OF OUR SUFFERING HERE
IT BINDS EARTH TO CALAMITY AND PAIN
THIS ALL MUST CONQUER WHO WOULD BRING DOWN GOD'S PEACE
THIS HIDDEN FOE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BREAST
MAN MUST OVERCOME OR MISS HIS HIGHER FATE
THIS IS THE INNER WAR WITHOUT ESCAPE
HARD IS THE WORLD-REDEEMER'S HEAVY TASK
THE WORLD ITSELF BECOMES HIS ADVERSARY
THOSE HE WOULD SAVE ARE HIS ANTAGONISTS
THIS WORLD IS IN LOVE WITH ITS OWN IGNORANCE
ITS DARKNESS TURNS AWAY FROM THE SAVIOUR LIGHT
IT GIVES THE CROSS IN PAYMENT FOR THE CROWN
HIS WORK IS A TRICKLE OF SPLENDOUR IN A LONG NIGHT
HE SEES THE LONG MARCH OF TIME THE LITTLE WON
A FEW ARE SAVED THE REST STRIVE ON AND FAIL
A SUN HAS PASSED ON EARTH NIGHT'S SHADOW FALLS
YES THERE ARE HAPPY WAYS NEAR TO GOD'S SUN
BUT FEW ARE THEY WHO TREAD THE SUNLIT PATH
ONLY THE PURE IN SOUL CAN WALK IN LIGHT
AN EXIT IS SHOWN A ROAD OF HARD ESCAPE
FROM THE SORROW AND THE DARKNESS AND THE CHAIN
BUT HOW SHALL A FEW ESCAPED RELEASE THE WORLD
THE HUMAN MASS LINGERS BENEATH THE YOKE
ESCAPE HOWEVER HIGH REDEEMS NOT LIFE
LIFE THAT IS LEFT BEHIND ON A FALLEN EARTH
ESCAPE CANNOT UPLIFT THE ABANDONED RACE
OR BRING TO IT VICTORY AND THE REIGN OF GOD
A GREATER POWER MUST COME A LARGER LIGHT
ALTHOUGH LIGHT GROWS ON EARTH AND NIGHT RECEDES
YET TILL THE EVIL IS SLAIN IN ITS OWN HOME
AND LIGHT INVADES THE WORLD'S INCONSCIENT BASE
AND PERISHED HAS THE ADVERSARY FORCE
449
HE STILL MUST LABOUR ON HIS WORK HALF DONE
ONE YET MAY COME ARMOURED INVINCIBLE
HIS WILL IMMOBILE MEETS THE MOBILE HOUR
THE WORLD'S BLOWS CANNOT BEND THAT VICTOR HEAD
CALM AND SURE ARE HIS STEPS IN THE GROWING NIGHT
THE GOAL RECEDES HE HURRIES NOT HIS PACE
HE TURNS NOT TO HIGH VOICES IN THE NIGHT
HE ASKS NO AID FROM THE INFERIOR GODS
HIS EYES ARE FIXED ON HIS IMMUTABLE AIM
MAN TURNS ASIDE OR CHOOSES EASIER PATHS
HE KEEPS TO THE ONE HIGH AND DIFFICULT ROAD
THAT SOLE CAN CLIMB TO THE ETERNAL'S PEAKS
THE INEFFABLE PLANES ALREADY HAVE FELT HIS TREAD
HE HAS MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH HIS INSTRUMENTS
BUT THE LIMITS FALL FROM HIM OF EARTH AND HEAVEN
THEIR LAW HE TRANSCENDS BUT USES AS HIS MEANS
HE HAS SEIZED LIFE'S HANDS HE HAS MASTERED HIS OWN HEART
THE FEINTS OF NATURE MISLEAD NOT HIS SIGHT
INFLEXIBLE HIS LOOK TOWARDS TRUTH'S FAR END
FATE'S DEAF RESISTANCE CANNOT BREAK HIS WILL
IN THE DREADFUL PASSAGES THE FATAL PATHS
INVULNERABLE HIS SOUL HIS HEART UNSLAIN
HE LIVES THROUGH THE OPPOSITION OF EARTH'S POWERS
AND NATURE'S AMBUSHES AND THE WORLD'S ATTACKS
HIS SPIRIT'S STATURE TRANSCENDING PAIN AND BLISS
HE FRONTS EVIL AND GOOD WITH CALM AND EQUAL EYES
HE TOO MUST GRAPPLE WITH THE RIDDLING SPHINX
AND PLUNGE INTO HER LONG OBSCURITY
HE HAS BROKEN INTO THE INCONSCIENT'S DEPTHS
THAT VEIL THEMSELVES EVEN FROM THEIR OWN REGARD
HE HAS SEEN GOD'S SLUMBER SHAPE THESE MAGIC WORLDS
HE HAS WATCHED THE DUMB GOD FASHIONING MATTER'S FRAME
DREAMING THE DREAMS OF ITS UNKNOWING SLEEP
AND WATCHED THE UNCONSCIOUS FORCE THAT BUILT THE STARS
HE HAS LEARNED THE INCONSCIENT'S WORKINGS AND ITS LAW
ITS INCOHERENT THOUGHTS AND RIGID ACTS
450
ITS HAZARD WASTES OF IMPULSE AND IDEA
THE CHAOS OF ITS MECHANIC FREQUENCIES
ITS RANDOM CALLS ITS WHISPERS FALSELY TRUE
MISLEADERS OF THE HOODED LISTENING SOUL
ALL THINGS COME TO ITS EAR BUT NOTHING ABIDES
ALL ROSE FROM THE SILENCE ALL GOES BACK TO ITS HUSH
ITS SOMNOLENCE FOUNDED THE UNIVERSE
ITS OBSCURE WAKING MAKES THE WORLD SEEM VAIN
ARISEN FROM NOTHINGNESS AND TOWARDS NOTHINGNESS TURNED
ITS DARK AND POTENT NESCIENCE WAS EARTH'S START
IT IS THE WASTE STUFF FROM WHICH ALL WAS MADE
INTO ITS DEEPS CREATION CAN COLLAPSE
ITS OPPOSITION CLOGS THE MARCH OF THE SOUL
IT IS THE MOTHER OF OUR IGNORANCE
HE MUST CALL LIGHT INTO ITS DARK ABYSMS
ELSE NEVER CAN TRUTH CONQUER MATTER'S SLEEP
AND ALL EARTH LOOK INTO THE EYES OF GOD
ALL THINGS OBSCURE HIS KNOWLEDGE MUST RELUME
ALL THINGS PERVERSE HIS POWER MUST UNKNOT
HE MUST PASS TO THE OTHER SHORE OF FALSEHOOD'S SEA
HE MUST ENTER THE WORLD'S DARK TO BRING THERE LIGHT
THE HEART OF EVIL MUST BE BARED TO HIS EYES
HE MUST LEARN ITS COSMIC DARK NECESSITY
ITS RIGHT AND ITS DIRE ROOTS IN NATURE'S SOIL
HE MUST KNOW THE THOUGHT THAT MOVES THE DEMON ACT
AND JUSTIFIES THE TITAN'S ERRING PRIDE
AND THE FALSEHOOD LURKING IN EARTH'S CROOKED DREAMS
HE MUST ENTER THE ETERNITY OF NIGHT
AND KNOW GOD'S DARKNESS AS HE KNOWS HIS SUN
FOR THIS HE MUST GO DOWN INTO THE PIT
FOR THIS HE MUST INVADE THE DOLOROUS VASTS
IMPERISHABLE AND WISE AND INFINITE
HE STILL MUST TRAVEL HELL THE WORLD TO SAVE
INTO THE ETERNAL LIGHT HE SHALL EMERGE
ON BORDERS OF THE MEETING OF ALL WORLDS
THERE ON THE VERGE OF NATURE'S SUMMIT STEPS
451
THE SECRET LAW OF EACH THING IS FULFILLED
ALL CONTRARIES HEAL THEIR LONG DISSIDENCE
THERE MEET AND CLASP THE ETERNAL OPPOSITES
THERE PAIN BECOMES A VIOLENT FIERY JOY
EVIL TURNS BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL GOOD
AND SORROW LIES UPON THE BREASTS OF BLISS
SHE HAS LEARNED TO WEEP GLAD TEARS OF HAPPINESS
HER GAZE IS CHARGED WITH A WISTFUL ECSTASY
THEN SHALL BE ENDED HERE THE LAW OF PAIN
EARTH SHALL BE MADE A HOME OF HEAVEN'S LIGHT
A SEER HEAVEN-BORN SHALL LODGE IN HUMAN BREASTS
THE SUPERCONSCIENT BEAM SHALL TOUCH MEN'S EYES
AND THE TRUTH-CONSCIOUS WORLD COME DOWN TO EARTH
INVADING MATTER WITH THE SPIRIT'S RAY
AWAKING ITS SILENCE TO IMMORTAL THOUGHTS
AWAKING THE DUMB HEART TO THE LIVING WORD
THIS MORTAL LIFE SHALL HOUSE ETERNITY'S BLISS
THE BODY'S SELF TASTE IMMORTALITY
THEN SHALL THE WORLD-REDEEMER'S TASK BE DONE
TILL THEN MUST LIFE CARRY ITS SEED OF DEATH
AND SORROW'S PLAINT BE HEARD IN THE SLOW NIGHT
O MORTAL BEAR THIS GREAT WORLD'S LAW OF PAIN
IN THY HARD PASSAGE THROUGH A SUFFERING WORLD
LEAN FOR THY SOUL'S SUPPORT ON HEAVEN'S STRENGTH
TURN TOWARDS HIGH TRUTH ASPIRE TO LOVE AND PEACE
A LITTLE BLISS IS LENT THEE FROM ABOVE
A TOUCH DIVINE UPON THY HUMAN DAYS
MAKE OF THY DAILY WAY A PILGRIMAGE
FOR THROUGH SMALL JOYS AND GRIEFS THOU MOV'ST TOWARDS GOD
HASTE NOT TOWARDS GODHEAD ON A DANGEROUS ROAD
OPEN NOT THY DOORWAYS TO A NAMELESS POWER
CLIMB NOT TO GODHEAD BY THE TITAN'S ROAD
AGAINST THE LAW HE PITS HIS SINGLE WILL
ACROSS ITS WAY HE THROWS HIS PRIDE OF MIGHT
HEAVENWARD HE CLAMBERS ON A STAIR OF STORMS
452
ASPIRING TO LIVE NEAR THE DEATHLESS SUN
HE STRIVES WITH A GIANT STRENGTH TO WREST BY FORCE
FROM LIFE AND NATURE THE IMMORTALS' RIGHT
HE TAKES BY STORM THE WORLD AND FATE AND HEAVEN
HE COMES NOT TO THE HIGH WORLD-MAKER'S SEAT
HE WAITS NOT FOR THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND OF GOD
TO RAISE HIM OUT OF HIS MORTALITY
ALL HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN LEAVE NOTHING FREE
STRETCHING HIS SMALL SELF TO COPE WITH THE INFINITE
OBSTRUCTING THE GODS' OPEN WAYS HE MAKES
HIS OWN ESTATE OF THE EARTH'S AIR AND LIGHT
A MONOPOLIST OF THE WORLD-ENERGY
HE DOMINATES THE LIFE OF COMMON MEN
HIS PAIN AND OTHERS' PAIN HE MAKES HIS MEANS
ON DEATH AND SUFFERING HE BUILDS HIS THRONE
IN THE HURRY AND CLANGOUR OF HIS ACTS OF MIGHT
IN A RIOT AND EXCESS OF FAME AND SHAME
BY HIS MAGNITUDES OF HATE AND VIOLENCE
BY THE QUAKING OF THE WORLD BENEATH HIS TREAD
HE MATCHES HIMSELF AGAINST THE ETERNAL'S CALM
AND FEELS IN HIMSELF THE GREATNESS OF A GOD
POWER IS HIS IMAGE OF CELESTIAL SELF
THE TITAN'S HEART IS A SEA OF FIRE AND FORCE
HE EXULTS IN THE DEATH OF THINGS AND RUIN AND FALL
HE FEEDS HIS STRENGTH WITH HIS OWN AND OTHERS' PAIN
IN THE WORLD'S PATHOS AND PASSION HE TAKES DELIGHT
HIS PRIDE HIS MIGHT CALL FOR THE STRUGGLE AND PANG
HE GLORIES IN THE SUFFERINGS OF THE FLESH
AND COVERS THE STIGMATA WITH THE STOIC'S NAME
HIS EYES BLINDED AND VISIONLESS STARE AT THE SUN
THE SEEKER'S SIGHT RECEDING FROM HIS HEART
CAN FIND NO MORE THE LIGHT OF ETERNITY
HE SEES THE BEYOND AS AN EMPTINESS VOID OF SOUL
AND TAKES HIS NIGHT FOR A DARK INFINITE
HIS NATURE MAGNIFIES THE UNREAL'S BLANK
AND SEES IN NOUGHT THE SOLE REALITY
453
HE WOULD STAMP HIS SINGLE FIGURE ON THE WORLD
OBSESS THE WORLD'S RUMOURS WITH HIS SINGLE NAME
HIS MOMENTS CENTRE THE VAST UNIVERSE
HE SEES HIS LITTLE SELF AS VERY GOD
HIS LITTLE 'I' HAS SWALLOWED THE WHOLE WORLD
HIS EGO HAS STRETCHED INTO INFINITY
HIS MIND A BEAT IN ORIGINAL NOTHINGNESS
CIPHERS HIS THOUGHT ON A SLATE OF HOURLESS TIME
HE BUILDS ON A MIGHTY VACANCY OF SOUL
A HUGE PHILOSOPHY OF NOTHINGNESS
IN HIM NIRVANA LIVES AND SPEAKS AND ACTS
IMPOSSIBLY CREATING A UNIVERSE
AN ETERNAL ZERO IS HIS FORMLESS SELF
HIS SPIRIT THE VOID IMPERSONAL ABSOLUTE
TAKE NOT THAT STRIDE O GROWING SOUL OF MAN
CAST NOT THY SELF INTO THAT NIGHT OF GOD
THE SOUL SUFFERING IS NOT ETERNITY'S KEY
OR RANSOM BY SORROW HEAVEN'S DEMAND ON LIFE
O MORTAL BEAR BUT ASK NOT FOR THE STROKE
TOO SOON WILL GRIEF AND ANGUISH FIND THEE OUT
TOO ENORMOUS IS THAT VENTURE FOR THY WILL
ONLY IN LIMITS CAN MAN'S STRENGTH BE SAFE
YET IS INFINITY THY SPIRIT'S GOAL
ITS BLISS IS THERE BEHIND THE WORLD'S FACE OF TEARS
A POWER IS IN THEE THAT THOU KNOWEST NOT
THOU ART A VESSEL OF THE IMPRISONED SPARK
IT SEEKS RELIEF FROM TIME'S ENVELOPMENT
AND WHILE THOU SHUTST IT IN THE SEAL IS PAIN
BLISS IS THE GODHEAD'S CROWN ETERNAL FREE
UNBURDENED BY LIFE'S BLIND MYSTERY OF PAIN
PAIN IS THE SIGNATURE OF THE IGNORANCE
ATTESTING THE SECRET GOD DENIED BY LIFE
UNTIL LIFE FINDS HIM PAIN CAN NEVER END
CALM IS SELF'S VICTORY OVERCOMING FATE
BEAR THOU SHALT FIND AT LAST THY ROAD TO BLISS
BLISS IS THE SECRET STUFF OF ALL THAT LIVES
454
EVEN PAIN AND GRIEF ARE GARBS OF WORLD-DELIGHT
IT HIDES BEHIND THY SORROW AND THY CRY
BECAUSE THY STRENGTH IS A PART AND NOT GOD'S WHOLE
BECAUSE AFFLICTED BY THE LITTLE SELF
THY CONSCIOUSNESS FORGETS TO BE DIVINE
AS IT WALKS IN THE VAGUE PENUMBRA OF THE FLESH
AND CANNOT BEAR THE WORLD'S TREMENDOUS TOUCH
THOU CRIEST OUT AND SAYST THAT THERE IS PAIN
INDIFFERENCE PAIN AND JOY A TRIPLE DISGUISE
ATTIRE OF THE RAPTUROUS DANCER IN THE WAYS
WITHHOLD FROM THEE THE BODY OF GOD'S BLISS
THY SPIRIT'S STRENGTH SHALL MAKE THEE ONE WITH GOD
THY AGONY SHALL CHANGE TO ECSTASY
INDIFFERENCE DEEPEN INTO INFINITY'S CALM
AND JOY LAUGH NUDE ON THE PEAKS OF THE ABSOLUTE
O MORTAL WHO COMPLAINST OF DEATH AND FATE
ACCUSE NONE OF THE HARMS THYSELF HAST CALLED
THIS TROUBLED WORLD THOU HAST CHOSEN FOR THY HOME
THOU ART THYSELF THE AUTHOR OF THY PAIN
ONCE IN THE IMMORTAL BOUNDLESSNESS OF SELF
IN A VAST OF TRUTH AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND LIGHT
THE SOUL LOOKED OUT FROM ITS FELICITY
IT FELT THE SPIRIT'S INTERMINABLE BLISS
IT KNEW ITSELF DEATHLESS TIMELESS SPACELESS ONE
IT SAW THE ETERNAL LIVED IN THE INFINITE
THEN CURIOUS OF A SHADOW THROWN BY TRUTH
IT STRAINED TOWARDS SOME OTHERNESS OF SELF
IT WAS DRAWN TO AN UNKNOWN FACE PEERING THROUGH NIGHT
IT SENSED A NEGATIVE INFINITY
A VOID SUPERNAL WHOSE IMMENSE EXCESS
IMITATING GOD AND EVERLASTING TIME
OFFERED A GROUND FOR NATURE'S ADVERSE BIRTH
AND MATTER'S RIGID HARD UNCONSCIOUSNESS
HARBOURING THE BRILLIANCE OF A TRANSIENT SOUL
THAT LIGHTS UP BIRTH AND DEATH AND IGNORANT LIFE
455
A MIND AROSE THAT STARED AT NOTHINGNESS
TILL FIGURES FORMED OF WHAT COULD NEVER BE
IT HOUSED THE CONTRARY OF ALL THAT IS
A NOUGHT APPEARED AS BEING'S HUGE SEALED CAUSE
ITS DUMB SUPPORT IN A BLANK INFINITE
IN WHOSE ABYSM SPIRIT MUST DISAPPEAR
A DARKENED NATURE LIVED AND HELD THE SEED
OF SPIRIT HIDDEN AND FEIGNING NOT TO BE
ETERNAL CONSCIOUSNESS BECAME A FREAK
OF AN UNSOULED ALMIGHTY INCONSCIENT
AND BREATHED NO MORE AS SPIRIT'S NATIVE AIR
BLISS WAS AN INCIDENT OF A MORTAL HOUR
A STRANGER IN THE INSENTIENT UNIVERSE
AS ONE DRAWN BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE VOID
THE SOUL ATTRACTED LEANED TO THE ABYSS
IT LONGED FOR THE ADVENTURE OF IGNORANCE
AND THE MARVEL AND SURPRISE OF THE UNKNOWN
AND THE ENDLESS POSSIBILITY THAT LURKED
IN THE WOMB OF CHAOS AND IN NOTHING'S GULF
OR LOOKED FROM THE UNFATHOMED EYES OF CHANCE
IT TIRED OF ITS UNCHANGING HAPPINESS
IT TURNED AWAY FROM IMMORTALITY
IT WAS DRAWN TO HAZARD'S CALL AND DANGER'S CHARM
IT YEARNED TO THE PATHOS OF GRIEF THE DRAMA OF PAIN
PERDITION'S PERIL THE WOUNDED BARE ESCAPE
THE MUSIC OF RUIN AND ITS GLAMOUR AND CRASH
THE SAVOUR OF PITY AND THE GAMBLE OF LOVE
AND PASSION AND THE AMBIGUOUS FACE OF FATE
A WORLD OF HARD ENDEAVOUR AND DIFFICULT TOIL
AND BATTLE ON EXTINCTION'S PERILOUS VERGE
A CLASH OF FORCES A VAST INCERTITUDE
THE JOY OF CREATION OUT OF NOTHINGNESS
STRANGE MEETINGS ON THE ROADS OF IGNORANCE
AND THE COMPANIONSHIP OF HALF-KNOWN SOULS
OR THE SOLITARY GREATNESS AND LONELY FORCE
OF A SEPARATE BEING CONQUERING ITS WORLD
456
CALLED IT FROM ITS TOO SAFE ETERNITY
A HUGE DESCENT BEGAN A GIANT FALL
FOR WHAT THE SPIRIT SEES CREATES A TRUTH
AND WHAT THE SOUL IMAGINES IS MADE A WORLD
A THOUGHT THAT LEAPED FROM THE TIMELESS CAN BECOME
INDICATOR OF COSMIC CONSEQUENCE
AND THE ITINERARY OF THE GODS
A CYCLIC MOVEMENT IN ETERNAL TIME
THUS CAME BORN FROM A BLIND TREMENDOUS CHOICE
THIS GREAT PERPLEXED AND DISCONTENTED WORLD
THIS HAUNT OF IGNORANCE THIS HOME OF PAIN
THERE ARE PITCHED DESIRE'S TENTS GRIEF'S HEADQUARTERS
A VAST DISGUISE CONCEALS THE ETERNAL'S BLISS
THEN ASWAPATI ANSWERED TO THE SEER
IS THEN THE SPIRIT RULED BY AN OUTWARD WORLD
O SEER IS THERE NO REMEDY WITHIN
BUT WHAT IS FATE IF NOT THE SPIRIT'S WILL
AFTER LONG TIME FULFILLED BY COSMIC FORCE
I DEEMED A MIGHTY POWER HAD COME WITH HER
IS NOT THAT POWER THE HIGH COMPEER OF FATE
BUT NARAD ANSWERED COVERING TRUTH WITH TRUTH
O ASWAPATI RANDOM SEEM THE WAYS
ALONG WHOSE BANKS YOUR FOOTSTEPS STRAY OR RUN
IN CASUAL HOURS OR MOMENTS OF THE GODS
YET YOUR LEAST STUMBLINGS ARE FORESEEN ABOVE
INFALLIBLY THE CURVES OF LIFE ARE DRAWN
FOLLOWING THE STREAM OF TIME THROUGH THE UNKNOWN
THEY ARE LED BY A CLUE THE CALM IMMORTALS KEEP
THIS BLAZONED HIEROGLYPH OF PROPHET MORNS
A MEANING MORE SUBLIME IN SYMBOLS WRITES
THAN SEALED THOUGHT WAKES TO BUT OF THIS HIGH SCRIPT
HOW SHALL MY VOICE CONVINCE THE MIND OF EARTH
HEAVEN'S WISER LOVE REJECTS THE MORTAL'S PRAYER
UNBLINDED BY THE BREATH OF HIS DESIRE
UNCLOUDED BY THE MISTS OF FEAR AND HOPE
457
IT BENDS ABOVE THE STRIFE OF LOVE WITH DEATH
IT KEEPS FOR HER HER PRIVILEGE OF PAIN
A GREATNESS IN THY DAUGHTER'S SOUL RESIDES
THAT CAN TRANSFORM HERSELF AND ALL AROUND
BUT MUST CROSS ON STONES OF SUFFERING TO ITS GOAL
ALTHOUGH DESIGNED LIKE A NECTAR CUP OF HEAVEN
OF HEAVENLY ETHER MADE SHE SOUGHT THIS AIR
SHE TOO MUST SHARE THE HUMAN NEED OF GRIEF
AND ALL HER CAUSE OF JOY TRANSMUTE TO PAIN
THE MIND OF MORTAL MAN IS LED BY WORDS
HIS SIGHT RETIRES BEHIND THE WALLS OF THOUGHT
AND LOOKS OUT ONLY THROUGH HALF-OPENED DOORS
HE CUTS THE BOUNDLESS TRUTH INTO SKY-STRIPS
AND EVERY STRIP HE TAKES FOR ALL THE HEAVENS
HE STARES AT INFINITE POSSIBILITY
AND GIVES TO THE PLASTIC VAST THE NAME OF CHANCE
HE SEES THE LONG RESULTS OF AN ALL-WISE FORCE
PLANNING A SEQUENCE OF STEPS IN ENDLESS TIME
BUT IN ITS LINKS IMAGINES A SENSELESS CHAIN
OR THE DEAD HAND OF COLD NECESSITY
HE ANSWERS NOT TO THE MYSTIC MOTHER'S HEART
MISSES THE ARDENT HEAVINGS OF HER BREAST
AND FEELS COLD RIGID LIMBS OF LIFELESS LAW
THE WILL OF THE TIMELESS WORKING OUT IN TIME
IN THE FREE ABSOLUTE STEPS OF COSMIC TRUTH
HE THINKS A DEAD MACHINE OR UNCONSCIOUS FATE
A MAGICIAN'S FORMULAS HAVE MADE MATTER'S LAWS
AND WHILE THEY LAST ALL THINGS BY THEM ARE BOUND
BUT THE SPIRIT'S CONSENT IS NEEDED FOR EACH ACT
AND FREEDOM WALKS IN THE SAME PACE WITH LAW
ALL HERE CAN CHANGE IF THE MAGICIAN CHOOSE
IF HUMAN WILL COULD BE MADE ONE WITH GOD'S
IF HUMAN THOUGHT COULD ECHO THE THOUGHTS OF GOD
MAN MIGHT BE ALL-KNOWING AND OMNIPOTENT
BUT NOW HE WALKS IN NATURE'S DOUBTFUL RAY
YET CAN THE MIND OF MAN RECEIVE GOD'S LIGHT
458
THE FORCE OF MAN CAN BE DRIVEN BY GOD'S FORCE
THEN IS HE A MIRACLE DOING MIRACLES
FOR ONLY SO CAN HE BE NATURE'S KING
IT IS DECREED AND SATYAVAN MUST DIE
THE HOUR IS FIXED CHOSEN THE FATAL STROKE
WHAT ELSE SHALL BE IS WRITTEN IN HER SOUL
BUT TILL THE HOUR REVEALS THE FATEFUL SCRIPT
THE WRITING WAITS ILLEGIBLE AND MUTE
FATE IS TRUTH WORKING OUT IN IGNORANCE
O KING THY FATE IS A TRANSACTION DONE
AT EVERY HOUR BETWEEN NATURE AND THY SOUL
WITH GOD FOR ITS FORESEEING ARBITER
FATE IS A BALANCE DRAWN IN DESTINY'S BOOK
MAN CAN ACCEPT HIS FATE HE CAN REFUSE
EVEN IF THE ONE MAINTAINS THE UNSEEN DECREE
HE WRITES THY REFUSAL IN THY CREDIT PAGE
FOR DOOM IS NOT A CLOSE A MYSTIC SEAL
ARISEN FROM THE TRAGIC CRASH OF LIFE
ARISEN FROM THE BODY'S TORTURE AND DEATH
THE SPIRIT RISES MIGHTIER BY DEFEAT
ITS GODLIKE WINGS GROW WIDER WITH EACH FALL
ITS SPLENDID FAILURES SUM TO VICTORY
O MAN THE EVENTS THAT MEET THEE ON THY ROAD
THOUGH THEY SMITE THY BODY AND SOUL WITH JOY AND GRIEF
ARE NOT THY FATE THEY TOUCH THEE AWHILE AND PASS
EVEN DEATH CAN CUT NOT SHORT THY SPIRIT'S WALK
THY GOAL THE ROAD THOU CHOOSEST ARE THY FATE
ON THE ALTAR THROWING THY THOUGHTS THY HEART THY WORKS
THY FATE IS A LONG SACRIFICE TO THE GODS
TILL THEY HAVE OPENED TO THEE THY SECRET SELF
AND MADE THEE ONE WITH THE INDWELLING GOD
O SOUL INTRUDER IN NATURE'S IGNORANCE
ARMED TRAVELLER TO THE UNSEEN SUPERNAL HEIGHTS
THY SPIRIT'S FATE IS A BATTLE AND CEASELESS MARCH
AGAINST INVISIBLE OPPONENT POWERS
A PASSAGE FROM MATTER INTO TIMELESS SELF
459
ADVENTURER THROUGH BLIND UNFORESEEING TIME
A FORCED ADVANCE THROUGH A LONG LINE OF LIVES
IT PUSHES ITS SPEARHEAD THROUGH THE CENTURIES
ACROSS THE DUST AND MIRE OF THE EARTHLY PLAIN
ON MANY GUARDED LINES AND DANGEROUS FRONTS
IN DIRE ASSAULTS IN WOUNDED SLOW RETREATS
HOLDING THE IDEAL'S RINGED AND BATTERED FORT
OR FIGHTING AGAINST ODDS IN LONELY POSTS
OR CAMPED IN NIGHT AROUND THE BIVOUAC'S FIRES
AWAITING THE TARDY TRUMPETS OF THE DAWN
IN HUNGER AND IN PLENTY AND IN PAIN
THROUGH PERIL AND THROUGH TRIUMPH AND THROUGH FALL
THROUGH LIFE'S GREEN LANES AND OVER HER DESERT SANDS
UP THE BALD MOOR ALONG THE SUNLIT RIDGE
IN SERRIED COLUMNS WITH A STRAGGLING REAR
LED BY ITS NOMAD VANGUARD'S SIGNAL FIRES
MARCHES THE ARMY OF THE WAYLOST GOD
THEN LATE THE JOY INEFFABLE IS FELT
THEN HE REMEMBERS HIS FORGOTTEN SELF
HE HAS REFOUND THE SKIES FROM WHICH HE FELL
AT LENGTH HIS FRONT'S INDOMITABLE LINE
FORCES THE LAST PASSES OF THE IGNORANCE
ADVANCING BEYOND NATURE'S LAST KNOWN BOUNDS
RECONNOITRING THE FORMIDABLE UNKNOWN
BEYOND THE LANDMARKS OF THINGS VISIBLE
IT MOUNTS THROUGH A MIRACULOUS UPPER AIR
TILL CLIMBING THE MUTE SUMMIT OF THE WORLD
HE STANDS UPON THE SPLENDOUR-PEAKS OF GOD
IN VAIN THOU MOURNST THAT SATYAVAN MUST DIE
HIS DEATH IS A BEGINNING OF GREATER LIFE
DEATH IS THE SPIRIT'S OPPORTUNITY
A VAST INTENTION HAS BROUGHT TWO SOULS CLOSE
AND LOVE AND DEATH CONSPIRE TOWARDS ONE GREAT END
FOR OUT OF DANGER AND PAIN HEAVEN-BLISS SHALL COME
TIME'S UNFORESEEN EVENT GOD'S SECRET PLAN
THIS WORLD WAS NOT BUILT WITH RANDOM BRICKS OF CHANCE
460
A BLIND GOD IS NOT DESTINY'S ARCHITECT
A CONSCIOUS POWER HAS DRAWN THE PLAN OF LIFE
THERE IS A MEANING IN EACH CURVE AND LINE
IT IS AN ARCHITECTURE HIGH AND GRAND
BY MANY NAMED AND NAMELESS MASONS BUILT
IN WHICH UNSEEING HANDS OBEY THE UNSEEN
AND OF ITS MASTER-BUILDERS SHE IS ONE
QUEEN STRIVE NO MORE TO CHANGE THE SECRET WILL
TIME'S ACCIDENTS ARE STEPS IN ITS VAST SCHEME
BRING NOT THY BRIEF AND HELPLESS HUMAN TEARS
ACROSS THE FATHOMLESS MOMENTS OF A HEART
THAT KNOWS ITS SINGLE WILL AND GOD'S AS ONE
IT CAN EMBRACE ITS HOSTILE DESTINY
IT SITS APART WITH GRIEF AND FACING DEATH
AFFRONTING ADVERSE FATE ARMED AND ALONE
IN THIS ENORMOUS WORLD STANDING APART
IN THE MIGHTINESS OF HER SILENT SPIRIT'S WILL
IN THE PASSION OF HER SOUL OF SACRIFICE
HER LONELY STRENGTH FACING THE UNIVERSE
AFFRONTING FATE ASKS NOT MAN'S HELP NOR GOD'S
SOMETIMES ONE LIFE IS CHARGED WITH EARTH'S DESTINY
IT CRIES NOT FOR SUCCOUR FROM THE TIME-BOUND POWERS
ALONE SHE IS EQUAL TO HER MIGHTY TASK
INTERVENE NOT IN A STRIFE TOO GREAT FOR THEE
A STRUGGLE TOO DEEP FOR MORTAL THOUGHT TO SOUND
ITS QUESTION TO THIS NATURE'S RIGID BOUNDS
WHEN THE SOUL FRONTS NUDE OF GARBS THE INFINITE
ITS TOO VAST THEME OF A LONELY MORTAL WILL
PACING THE SILENCE OF ETERNITY
AS A STAR UNCOMPANIONED MOVES IN HEAVEN
UNASTONISHED BY THE IMMENSITIES OF SPACE
TRAVELLING INFINITY BY ITS OWN LIGHT
THE GREAT ARE STRONGEST WHEN THEY STAND ALONE
A GOD-GIVEN MIGHT OF BEING IS THEIR FORCE
A RAY FROM SELF'S SOLITUDE OF LIGHT THE GUIDE
THE SOUL THAT CAN LIVE ALONE WITH ITSELF MEETS GOD
461
ITS LONELY UNIVERSE IS THEIR RENDEZVOUS
A DAY MAY COME WHEN SHE MUST STAND UNHELPED
ON A DANGEROUS BRINK OF THE WORLD'S DOOM AND HERS
CARRYING THE WORLD'S FUTURE ON HER LONELY BREAST
CARRYING THE HUMAN HOPE IN A HEART LEFT SOLE
TO CONQUER OR FAIL ON A LAST DESPERATE VERGE
ALONE WITH DEATH AND CLOSE TO EXTINCTION'S EDGE
HER SINGLE GREATNESS IN THAT LAST DIRE SCENE
MUST CROSS ALONE A PERILOUS BRIDGE IN TIME
AND REACH AN APEX OF WORLD-DESTINY
WHERE ALL IS WON OR ALL IS LOST FOR MAN
IN THAT TREMENDOUS SILENCE LONE AND LOST
OF A DECIDING HOUR IN THE WORLD'S FATE
IN HER SOUL'S CLIMBING BEYOND MORTAL TIME
WHEN SHE STANDS SOLE WITH DEATH OR SOLE WITH GOD
APART UPON A SILENT DESPERATE BRINK
ALONE WITH HER SELF AND DEATH AND DESTINY
AS ON SOME VERGE BETWEEN TIME AND TIMELESSNESS
WHEN BEING MUST END OR LIFE REBUILD ITS BASE
ALONE SHE MUST CONQUER OR ALONE MUST FALL
NO HUMAN AID CAN REACH HER IN THAT HOUR
NO ARMOURED GOD STAND SHINING AT HER SIDE
CRY NOT TO HEAVEN FOR SHE ALONE CAN SAVE
FOR THIS THE SILENT FORCE CAME MISSIONED DOWN
IN HER THE CONSCIOUS WILL TOOK HUMAN SHAPE
SHE ONLY CAN SAVE HERSELF AND SAVE THE WORLD
O QUEEN STAND BACK FROM THAT STUPENDOUS SCENE
COME NOT BETWEEN HER AND HER HOUR OF FATE
HER HOUR MUST COME AND NONE CAN INTERVENE
THINK NOT TO TURN HER FROM HER HEAVEN-SENT TASK
STRIVE NOT TO SAVE HER FROM HER OWN HIGH WILL
THOU HAST NO PLACE IN THAT TREMENDOUS STRIFE
THY LOVE AND LONGING ARE NOT ARBITERS THERE
LEAVE THE WORLD'S FATE AND HER TO GOD'S SOLE GUARD
EVEN IF HE SEEMS TO LEAVE HER TO HER LONE STRENGTH
EVEN THOUGH ALL FALTERS AND FALLS AND SEES AN END
462
AND THE HEART FAILS AND ONLY ARE DEATH AND NIGHT
GOD-GIVEN HER STRENGTH CAN BATTLE AGAINST DOOM
EVEN ON A BRINK WHERE DEATH ALONE SEEMS CLOSE
AND NO HUMAN STRENGTH CAN HINDER OR CAN HELP
THINK NOT TO INTERCEDE WITH THE HIDDEN WILL
INTRUDE NOT TWIXT HER SPIRIT AND ITS FORCE
BUT LEAVE HER TO HER MIGHTY SELF AND FATE
HE SPOKE AND CEASED AND LEFT THE EARTHLY SCENE
AWAY FROM THE STRIFE AND SUFFERING ON OUR GLOBE
HE TURNED TOWARDS HIS FAR-OFF BLISSFUL HOME
A BRILLIANT ARROW POINTING STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN
THE LUMINOUS BODY OF THE ETHEREAL SEER
ASSAILED THE PURPLE GLORY OF THE NOON
AND DISAPPEARED LIKE A RECEDING STAR
VANISHING INTO THE LIGHT OF THE UNSEEN
BUT STILL A CRY WAS HEARD IN THE INFINITE
AND STILL TO THE LISTENING SOUL ON MORTAL EARTH
A HIGH AND FAR IMPERISHABLE VOICE
CHANTED THE ANTHEM OF ETERNAL LOVE
465
FATE FOLLOWED HER FORESEEN IMMUTABLE ROAD
MAN'S HOPES AND LONGINGS BUILD THE JOURNEYING WHEELS
THAT BEAR THE BODY OF HIS DESTINY
AND LEAD HIS BLIND WILL TOWARDS AN UNKNOWN GOAL
HIS FATE WITHIN HIM SHAPES HIS ACTS AND RULES
ITS FACE AND FORM ALREADY ARE BORN IN HIM
ITS PARENTAGE IS IN HIS SECRET SOUL
HERE MATTER SEEMS TO MOULD THE BODY'S LIFE
AND THE SOUL FOLLOWS WHERE ITS NATURE DRIVES
NATURE AND FATE COMPEL HIS FREE-WILL'S CHOICE
BUT GREATER SPIRITS THIS BALANCE CAN REVERSE
AND MAKE THE SOUL THE ARTIST OF ITS FATE
THIS IS THE MYSTIC TRUTH OUR IGNORANCE HIDES
DOOM IS A PASSAGE FOR OUR INBORN FORCE
OUR ORDEAL IS THE HIDDEN SPIRIT'S CHOICE
ANANKE IS OUR BEING'S OWN DECREE
ALL WAS FULFILLED THE HEART OF SAVITRI
FLOWER-SWEET AND ADAMANT PASSIONATE AND CALM
HAD CHOSEN AND ON HER STRENGTH'S UNBENDING ROAD
FORCED TO ITS ISSUE THE LONG COSMIC CURVE
ONCE MORE SHE SAT BEHIND LOUD HASTENING HOOVES
A SPEED OF ARMOURED SQUADRONS AND A VOICE
FAR-HEARD OF CHARIOTS BORE HER FROM HER HOME
A COUCHANT EARTH WAKENED IN ITS DUMB MUSE
LOOKED UP AT HER FROM A VAST INDOLENCE
HILLS WALLOWING IN A BRIGHT HAZE LARGE LANDS
THAT LOLLED AT EASE BENEATH THE SUMMER HEAVENS
REGION ON REGION SPACIOUS IN THE SUN
CITIES LIKE CHRYSOLITES IN THE WIDE BLAZE
AND YELLOW RIVERS PACING LION-MANED
466
LED TO THE SHALWA MARCHES' EMERALD LINE
A HAPPY FRONT TO IRON VASTNESSES
AND AUSTERE PEAKS AND TITAN SOLITUDES
ONCE MORE WAS NEAR THE FAIR AND FATED PLACE
THE BORDERS GLEAMING WITH THE GROVES' DELIGHT
WHERE FIRST SHE MET THE FACE OF SATYAVAN
AND HE SAW LIKE ONE WAKING INTO A DREAM
SOME TIMELESS BEAUTY AND REALITY
THE MOON-GOLD SWEETNESS OF HEAVEN'S EARTH-BORN CHILD
THE PAST RECEDED AND THE FUTURE NEARED
FAR NOW BEHIND LAY MADRA'S SPACIOUS HALLS
THE WHITE CARVED PILLARS THE COOL DIM ALCOVES
THE TINGED MOSAIC OF THE CRYSTAL FLOORS
THE TOWERED PAVILIONS THE WIND-RIPPLED POOLS
AND GARDENS HUMMING WITH THE MURMUR OF BEES
FORGOTTEN SOON OR A PALE MEMORY
THE FOUNTAIN'S PLASH IN THE WHITE STONE-BOUND POOL
THE THOUGHTFUL NOONTIDE'S BROODING SOLEMN TRANCE
THE COLONNADE'S DREAM GREY IN THE QUIET EVE
THE SLOW MOONRISE GLIDING IN FRONT OF NIGHT
LEFT FAR BEHIND WERE NOW THE FACES KNOWN
THE HAPPY SILKEN BABBLE ON LAUGHTER'S LIPS
AND THE CLOSE-CLINGING CLASP OF INTIMATE HANDS
AND ADORATION'S LIGHT IN CHERISHED EYES
OFFERED TO THE ONE SOVEREIGN OF THEIR LIFE
NATURE'S PRIMAEVAL LONELINESS WAS HERE
HERE ONLY WAS THE VOICE OF BIRD AND BEAST
THE ASCETIC'S EXILE IN THE DIM-SOULED HUGE
INHUMAN FOREST FAR FROM CHEERFUL SOUND
OF MAN'S BLITHE CONVERSE AND HIS CROWDED DAYS
IN A BROAD EVE WITH ONE RED EYE OF CLOUD
THROUGH A NARROW OPENING A GREEN FLOWERED CLEFT
OUT OF THE STARE OF SKY AND SOIL THEY CAME
INTO A MIGHTY HOME OF EMERALD DUSK
THERE ONWARD LED BY A FAINT BROODING PATH
WHICH TOILED THROUGH THE SHADOW OF ENORMOUS TRUNKS
467
AND UNDER ARCHES MISERS OF SUNSHINE
THEY SAW LOW THATCHED ROOFS OF A HERMITAGE
HUDDLED BENEATH A PATCH OF AZURE HUE
IN A SUNLIT CLEARING THAT SEEMED THE OUTBREAK
OF A GLAD SMILE IN THE FOREST'S MONSTROUS HEART
A RUDE REFUGE OF THE THOUGHT AND WILL OF MAN
WATCHED BY THE CROWDING GIANTS OF THE WOOD
ARRIVED IN THAT ROUGH-HEWN HOMESTEAD THEY GAVE
QUESTIONING NO MORE THE STRANGENESS OF HER FATE
THEIR PRIDE AND LOVED ONE TO THE GREAT BLIND KING
A REGAL PILLAR OF FALLEN MIGHTINESS
AND THE STATELY CARE-WORN WOMAN ONCE A QUEEN
WHO NOW HOPED NOTHING FOR HERSELF FROM LIFE
BUT ALL THINGS ONLY HOPED FOR HER ONE CHILD
CALLING ON THAT SINGLE HEAD FROM PARTIAL FATE
ALL JOY OF EARTH ALL HEAVEN'S BEATITUDE
ADORING WISDOM AND BEAUTY LIKE A YOUNG GOD'S
SHE SAW HIM LOVED BY HEAVEN AS BY HERSELF
SHE REJOICED IN HIS BRIGHTNESS AND BELIEVED IN HIS FATE
AND KNEW NOT OF THE EVIL DRAWING NEAR
LINGERING SOME DAYS UPON THE FOREST VERGE
LIKE MEN WHO LENGTHEN OUT DEPARTURE'S PAIN
UNWILLING TO SEPARATE SORROWFUL CLINGING HANDS
UNWILLING TO SEE FOR THE LAST TIME A FACE
HEAVY WITH THE SORROW OF A COMING DAY
AND WONDERING AT THE CARELESSNESS OF FATE
WHO BREAKS WITH IDLE HANDS HER SUPREME WORKS
THEY PARTED FROM HER WITH PAIN-FRAUGHT BURDENED HEARTS
AS FORCED BY INESCAPABLE FATE WE PART
FROM ONE WHOM WE SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN
DRIVEN BY THE SINGULARITY OF HER FATE
HELPLESS AGAINST THE CHOICE OF SAVITRI'S HEART
THEY LEFT HER TO HER RAPTURE AND HER DOOM
IN THE TREMENDOUS FOREST'S SAVAGE CHARGE
ALL PUT BEHIND HER THAT WAS ONCE HER LIFE
ALL WELCOMED THAT HENCEFORTH WAS HIS AND HERS
468
SHE ABODE WITH SATYAVAN IN THE WILD WOODS
PRICELESS SHE DEEMED HER JOY SO CLOSE TO DEATH
APART WITH LOVE SHE LIVED FOR LOVE ALONE
AS IF SELF-POISED ABOVE THE MARCH OF DAYS
HER IMMOBILE SPIRIT WATCHED THE HASTE OF TIME
A STATUE OF PASSION AND INVINCIBLE FORCE
AN ABSOLUTISM OF SWEET IMPERIOUS WILL
A TRANQUILLITY AND A VIOLENCE OF THE GODS
INDOMITABLE AND IMMUTABLE
AT FIRST TO HER BENEATH THE SAPPHIRE HEAVENS
THE SYLVAN SOLITUDE WAS A GORGEOUS DREAM
AN ALTAR OF THE SUMMER'S SPLENDOUR AND FIRE
A SKY-TOPPED FLOWER-HUNG PALACE OF THE GODS
AND ALL ITS SCENES A SMILE ON RAPTURE'S LIPS
AND ALL ITS VOICES BARDS OF HAPPINESS
THERE WAS A CHANTING IN THE CASUAL WIND
THERE WAS A GLORY IN THE LEAST SUNBEAM
NIGHT WAS A CHRYSOPRASE ON VELVET CLOTH
A NESTLING DARKNESS OR A MOONLIT DEEP
DAY WAS A PURPLE PAGEANT AND A HYMN
A WAVE OF THE LAUGHTER OF LIGHT FROM MORN TO EVE
HIS ABSENCE WAS A DREAM OF MEMORY
HIS PRESENCE WAS THE EMPIRE OF A GOD
A FUSING OF THE JOYS OF EARTH AND HEAVEN
A TREMULOUS BLAZE OF NUPTIAL RAPTURE PASSED
A RUSHING OF TWO SPIRITS TO BE ONE
A BURNING OF TWO BODIES IN ONE FLAME
OPENED WERE GATES OF UNFORGETTABLE BLISS
TWO LIVES WERE LOCKED WITHIN AN EARTHLY HEAVEN
AND FATE AND GRIEF FLED FROM THAT FIERY HOUR
BUT SOON NOW FAILED THE SUMMER'S ARDENT BREATH
AND THRONGS OF BLUE-BLACK CLOUDS CREPT THROUGH THE SKY
AND RAIN FLED SOBBING OVER THE DRIPPING LEAVES
AND STORM BECAME THE FOREST'S TITAN VOICE
THEN LISTENING TO THE THUNDER'S FATAL CRASH
469
AND THE FUGITIVE PATTERING FOOTSTEPS OF THE SHOWERS
AND THE LONG UNSATISFIED PANTING OF THE WIND
AND SORROW MUTTERING IN THE SOUND-VEXED NIGHT
THE GRIEF OF ALL THE WORLD CAME NEAR TO HER
NIGHT'S DARKNESS SEEMED HER FUTURE'S OMINOUS FACE
THE SHADOW OF HER LOVER'S DOOM AROSE
AND FEAR LAID HANDS UPON HER MORTAL HEART
THE MOMENTS SWIFT AND RUTHLESS RACED ALARMED
HER THOUGHTS HER MIND REMEMBERED NARAD'S DATE
A TREMBLING MOVED ACCOUNTANT OF HER RICHES
SHE RECKONED THE INSUFFICIENT DAYS BETWEEN
A DIRE EXPECTANCY KNOCKED AT HER BREAST
DREADFUL TO HER WERE THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE HOURS
GRIEF CAME A PASSIONATE STRANGER TO HER GATE
BANISHED WHEN IN HIS ARMS OUT OF HER SLEEP
IT ROSE AT MORN TO LOOK INTO HER FACE
VAINLY SHE FLED INTO ABYSMS OF BLISS
FROM HER PURSUING FORESIGHT OF THE END
THE MORE SHE PLUNGED INTO LOVE THAT ANGUISH GREW
HER DEEPEST GRIEF FROM SWEETEST GULFS AROSE
REMEMBRANCE WAS A POIGNANT PANG SHE FELT
EACH DAY A GOLDEN LEAF TORN CRUELLY OUT
FROM HER TOO SLENDER BOOK OF LOVE AND JOY
THUS SWAYING IN STRONG GUSTS OF HAPPINESS
AND SWIMMING IN FOREBODING'S SOMBRE WAVES
AND FEEDING SORROW AND TERROR WITH HER HEART
FOR NOW THEY SAT AMONG HER BOSOM'S GUESTS
OR IN HER INNER CHAMBER PACED APART
HER EYES STARED BLIND INTO THE FUTURE'S NIGHT
OUT OF HER SEPARATE SELF SHE LOOKED AND SAW
MOVING AMID THE UNCONSCIOUS FACES LOVED
IN MIND A STRANGER THOUGH IN HEART SO NEAR
THE IGNORANT SMILING WORLD GO HAPPILY BY
UPON ITS WAY TOWARDS AN UNKNOWN DOOM
AND WONDERED AT THE CARELESS LIVES OF MEN
AS IF IN DIFFERENT WORLDS THEY WALKED THOUGH CLOSE
470
THEY CONFIDENT OF THE RETURNING SUN
THEY WRAPPED IN LITTLE HOURLY HOPES AND TASKS
SHE IN HER DREADFUL KNOWLEDGE WAS ALONE
THE RICH AND HAPPY SECRECY THAT ONCE
ENSHRINED HER AS IF IN A SILVER BOWER
APART IN A BRIGHT NEST OF THOUGHTS AND DREAMS
MADE ROOM FOR TRAGIC HOURS OF SOLITUDE
AND LONELY GRIEF THAT NONE COULD SHARE OR KNOW
A BODY SEEING THE END TOO SOON OF JOY
AND THE FRAGILE HAPPINESS OF ITS MORTAL LOVE
HER QUIET VISAGE STILL AND SWEET AND CALM
HER GRACEFUL DAILY ACTS WERE NOW A MASK
IN VAIN SHE LOOKED UPON HER DEPTHS TO FIND
A GROUND OF STILLNESS AND THE SPIRIT'S PEACE
STILL VEILED FROM HER WAS THE SILENT BEING WITHIN
WHO SEES LIFE'S DRAMA PASS WITH UNMOVED EYES
SUPPORTS THE SORROW OF THE MIND AND HEART
AND BEARS IN HUMAN BREASTS THE WORLD AND FATE
A GLIMPSE OR FLASHES CAME THE PRESENCE WAS HID
ONLY HER VIOLENT HEART AND PASSIONATE WILL
WERE PUSHED IN FRONT TO MEET THE IMMUTABLE DOOM
DEFENCELESS NUDE BOUND TO HER HUMAN LOT
THEY HAD NO MEANS TO ACT NO WAY TO SAVE
THESE SHE CONTROLLED NOTHING WAS SHOWN OUTSIDE
SHE WAS STILL TO THEM THE CHILD THEY KNEW AND LOVED
THE SORROWING WOMAN THEY SAW NOT WITHIN
NO CHANGE WAS IN HER BEAUTIFUL MOTIONS SEEN
A WORSHIPPED EMPRESS ALL ONCE VIED TO SERVE
SHE MADE HERSELF THE DILIGENT SERF OF ALL
NOR SPARED THE LABOUR OF BROOM AND JAR AND WELL
OR CLOSE GENTLE TENDING OR TO HEAP THE FIRE
OF ALTAR AND KITCHEN NO SLIGHT TASK ALLOWED
TO OTHERS THAT HER WOMAN'S STRENGTH MIGHT DO
IN ALL HER ACTS A STRANGE DIVINITY SHONE
INTO A SIMPLEST MOVEMENT SHE COULD BRING
A ONENESS WITH EARTH'S GLOWING ROBE OF LIGHT
A LIFTING UP OF COMMON ACTS BY LOVE
471
ALL-LOVE WAS HERS AND ITS ONE HEAVENLY CORD
BOUND ALL TO ALL WITH HER AS GOLDEN TIE
BUT WHEN HER GRIEF TO THE SURFACE PRESSED TOO CLOSE
THESE THINGS ONCE GRACIOUS ADJUNCTS OF HER JOY
SEEMED MEANINGLESS TO HER A GLEAMING SHELL
OR WERE A ROUND MECHANICAL AND VOID
HER BODY'S ACTIONS SHARED NOT BY HER WILL
ALWAYS BEHIND THIS STRANGE DIVIDED LIFE
HER SPIRIT LIKE A SEA OF LIVING FIRE
POSSESSED HER LOVER AND TO HIS BODY CLUNG
ONE LOCKED EMBRACE TO GUARD ITS THREATENED MATE
AT NIGHT SHE WOKE THROUGH THE SLOW SILENT HOURS
BROODING ON THE TREASURE OF HIS BOSOM AND FACE
HUNG O'ER THE SLEEP-BOUND BEAUTY OF HIS BROW
OR LAID HER BURNING CHEEK UPON HIS FEET
WAKING AT MORN HER LIPS ENDLESSLY CLUNG TO HIS
UNWILLING EVER TO SEPARATE AGAIN
OR LOSE THAT HONEYED DRAIN OF LINGERING JOY
UNWILLING TO LOOSE HIS BODY FROM HER BREAST
THE WARM INADEQUATE SIGNS THAT LOVE MUST USE
INTOLERANT OF THE POVERTY OF TIME
HER PASSION CATCHING AT THE FUGITIVE HOURS
WILLED THE EXPENSE OF CENTURIES IN ONE DAY
OF PRODIGAL LOVE AND THE SURF OF ECSTASY
OR ELSE SHE STROVE EVEN IN MORTAL TIME
TO BUILD A LITTLE ROOM FOR TIMELESSNESS
BY THE DEEP UNION OF TWO HUMAN LIVES
HER SOUL SECLUDED SHUT INTO HIS SOUL
AFTER ALL WAS GIVEN SHE DEMANDED STILL
EVEN BY HIS STRONG EMBRACE UNSATISFIED
SHE LONGED TO CRY O TENDER SATYAVAN
O LOVER OF MY SOUL GIVE MORE GIVE MORE
OF LOVE WHILE YET THOU CANST TO HER THOU LOV'ST
IMPRINT THYSELF FOR EVERY NERVE TO KEEP
THAT THRILLS TO THEE THE MESSAGE OF MY HEART
FOR SOON WE PART AND WHO SHALL KNOW HOW LONG
BEFORE THE GREAT WHEEL IN ITS MONSTROUS ROUND
472
RESTORE US TO EACH OTHER AND OUR LOVE
TOO WELL SHE LOVED TO SPEAK A FATEFUL WORD
AND LAY HER BURDEN ON HIS HAPPY HEAD
SHE PRESSED THE OUTSURGING GRIEF BACK INTO HER BREAST
TO DWELL WITHIN SILENT UNHELPED ALONE
BUT SATYAVAN SOMETIMES HALF UNDERSTOOD
OR FELT AT LEAST WITH THE UNCERTAIN ANSWER
OF OUR THOUGHT-BLINDED HEARTS THE UNUTTERED NEED
THE UNPLUMBED ABYSS OF HER DEEP PASSIONATE WANT
ALL OF HIS SPEEDING DAYS THAT HE COULD SPARE
FROM LABOUR IN THE FOREST HEWING WOOD
AND HUNTING FOOD IN THE WILD SYLVAN GLADES
AND SERVICE TO HIS FATHER'S SIGHTLESS LIFE
HE GAVE TO HER AND HELPED TO INCREASE THE HOURS
BY THE NEARNESS OF HIS PRESENCE AND HIS CLASP
AND LAVISH SOFTNESS OF HEART-SEEKING WORDS
AND THE CLOSE BEATING FELT OF HEART ON HEART
ALL WAS TOO LITTLE FOR HER BOTTOMLESS NEED
IF IN HIS PRESENCE SHE FORGOT AWHILE
GRIEF FILLED HIS ABSENCE WITH ITS ACHING TOUCH
SHE SAW THE DESERT OF HER COMING DAYS
IMAGED IN EVERY SOLITARY HOUR
ALTHOUGH WITH A VAIN IMAGINARY BLISS
OF FIERY UNION THROUGH DEATH'S DOOR OF ESCAPE
SHE DREAMED OF HER BODY ROBED IN FUNERAL FLAME
SHE KNEW SHE MUST NOT CLUTCH THAT HAPPINESS
TO DIE WITH HIM AND FOLLOW SEIZING HIS ROBE
ACROSS OUR OTHER COUNTRIES TRAVELLERS GLAD
INTO THE SWEET OR TERRIBLE BEYOND
FOR THOSE SAD PARENTS STILL WOULD NEED HER HERE
TO HELP THE EMPTY REMNANT OF THEIR DAY
OFTEN IT SEEMED TO HER THE AGES' PAIN
HAD PRESSED THEIR QUINTESSENCE INTO HER SINGLE WOE
CONCENTRATING IN HER A TORTURED WORLD
THUS IN THE SILENT CHAMBER OF HER SOUL
CLOISTERING HER LOVE TO LIVE WITH SECRET GRIEF
SHE DWELT LIKE A DUMB PRIEST WITH HIDDEN GODS
473
UNAPPEASED BY THE WORDLESS OFFERING OF HER DAYS
LIFTING TO THEM HER SORROW LIKE FRANKINCENSE
HER LIFE THE ALTAR HERSELF THE SACRIFICE
YET EVER THEY GREW INTO EACH OTHER MORE
UNTIL IT SEEMED NO POWER COULD REND APART
SINCE EVEN THE BODY'S WALLS COULD NOT DIVIDE
FOR WHEN HE WANDERED IN THE FOREST OFT
HER CONSCIOUS SPIRIT WALKED WITH HIM AND KNEW
HIS ACTIONS AS IF IN HERSELF HE MOVED
HE LESS AWARE THRILLED WITH HER FROM AFAR
ALWAYS THE STATURE OF HER PASSION GREW
GRIEF FEAR BECAME THE FOOD OF MIGHTY LOVE
INCREASED BY ITS TORMENT IT FILLED THE WHOLE WORLD
IT WAS ALL HER LIFE BECAME HER WHOLE EARTH AND HEAVEN
ALTHOUGH LIFE-BORN AN INFANT OF THE HOURS
IMMORTAL IT WALKED UNSLAYABLE AS THE GODS
HER SPIRIT STRETCHED MEASURELESS IN STRENGTH DIVINE
AN ANVIL FOR THE BLOWS OF FATE AND TIME
OR TIRED OF SORROW'S PASSIONATE LUXURY
GRIEF'S SELF BECAME CALM DULL-EYED RESOLUTE
AWAITING SOME ISSUE OF ITS FIERY STRUGGLE
SOME DEED IN WHICH IT MIGHT FOR EVER CEASE
VICTORIOUS OVER ITSELF AND DEATH AND TEARS
THE YEAR NOW PAUSED UPON THE BRINK OF CHANGE
NO MORE THE STORMS SAILED WITH STUPENDOUS WINGS
AND THUNDER STRODE IN WRATH ACROSS THE WORLD
BUT STILL WAS HEARD A MUTTERING IN THE SKY
AND RAIN DRIPPED WEARILY THROUGH THE MOURNFUL AIR
AND GREY SLOW-DRIFTING CLOUDS SHUT IN THE EARTH
SO HER GRIEF'S HEAVY SKY SHUT IN HER HEART
A STILL SELF HID BEHIND BUT GAVE NO LIGHT
NO VOICE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORGOTTEN HEIGHTS
ONLY IN THE PRIVACY OF ITS BROODING PAIN
HER HUMAN HEART SPOKE TO THE BODY'S FATE
474
AS IN THE VIGILANCE OF THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT
THROUGH THE SLOW HEAVY-FOOTED SILENT HOURS
REPRESSING IN HER BOSOM ITS LOAD OF GRIEF
SHE SAT STARING AT THE DUMB TREAD OF TIME
AND THE APPROACH OF EVER-NEARING FATE
A SUMMONS FROM HER BEING'S SUMMIT CAME
A SOUND A CALL THAT BROKE THE SEALS OF NIGHT
ABOVE HER BROWS WHERE WILL AND KNOWLEDGE MEET
A MIGHTY VOICE INVADED MORTAL SPACE
IT SEEMED TO COME FROM INACCESSIBLE HEIGHTS
AND YET WAS INTIMATE WITH ALL THE WORLD
AND KNEW THE MEANING OF THE STEPS OF TIME
AND SAW ETERNAL DESTINY'S CHANGELESS SCENE
FILLING THE FAR PROSPECT OF THE COSMIC GAZE
AS THE VOICE TOUCHED HER BODY BECAME A STARK
AND RIGID GOLDEN STATUE OF MOTIONLESS TRANCE
A STONE OF GOD LIT BY AN AMETHYST SOUL
AROUND HER BODY'S STILLNESS ALL GREW STILL
HER HEART LISTENED TO ITS SLOW MEASURED BEATS
HER MIND RENOUNCING THOUGHT HEARD AND WAS MUTE
WHY CAMEST THOU TO THIS DUMB DEATHBOUND EARTH
THIS IGNORANT LIFE BENEATH INDIFFERENT SKIES
TIED LIKE A SACRIFICE ON THE ALTAR OF TIME
O SPIRIT O IMMORTAL ENERGY
IF 'TWAS TO NURSE GRIEF IN A HELPLESS HEART
OR WITH HARD TEARLESS EYES AWAIT THY DOOM
ARISE O SOUL AND VANQUISH TIME AND DEATH
BUT SAVITRI'S HEART REPLIED IN THE DIM NIGHT
MY STRENGTH IS TAKEN FROM ME AND GIVEN TO DEATH
WHY SHOULD I LIFT MY HANDS TO THE SHUT HEAVENS
OR STRUGGLE WITH MUTE INEVITABLE FATE
475
OR HOPE IN VAIN TO UPLIFT AN IGNORANT RACE
WHO HUG THEIR LOT AND MOCK THE SAVIOUR LIGHT
AND SEE IN MIND WISDOM'S SOLE TABERNACLE
IN ITS HARSH PEAK AND ITS INCONSCIENT BASE
A ROCK OF SAFETY AND AN ANCHOR OF SLEEP
IS THERE A GOD WHOM ANY CRY CAN MOVE
HE SITS IN PEACE AND LEAVES THE MORTAL'S STRENGTH
IMPOTENT AGAINST HIS CALM OMNIPOTENT LAW
AND INCONSCIENCE AND THE ALMIGHTY HANDS OF DEATH
WHAT NEED HAVE I WHAT NEED HAS SATYAVAN
TO AVOID THE BLACK-MESHED NET THE DISMAL DOOR
OR CALL A MIGHTIER LIGHT INTO LIFE'S CLOSED ROOM
A GREATER LAW INTO MAN'S LITTLE WORLD
WHY SHOULD I STRIVE WITH EARTH'S UNYIELDING LAWS
OR STAVE OFF DEATH'S INEVITABLE HOUR
THIS SURELY IS BEST TO PACTISE WITH MY FATE
AND FOLLOW CLOSE BEHIND MY LOVER'S STEPS
AND PASS THROUGH NIGHT FROM TWILIGHT TO THE SUN
ACROSS THE TENEBROUS RIVER THAT DIVIDES
THE ADJOINING PARISHES OF EARTH AND HEAVEN
THEN COULD WE LIE INARMED BREAST UPON BREAST
UNTROUBLED BY THOUGHT UNTROUBLED BY OUR HEARTS
FORGETTING MAN AND LIFE AND TIME AND ITS HOURS
FORGETTING ETERNITY'S CALL FORGETTING GOD
THE VOICE REPLIED IS THIS ENOUGH O SPIRIT
AND WHAT SHALL THY SOUL SAY WHEN IT WAKES AND KNOWS
THE WORK WAS LEFT UNDONE FOR WHICH IT CAME
OR IS THIS ALL FOR THY BEING BORN ON EARTH
CHARGED WITH A MANDATE FROM ETERNITY
A LISTENER TO THE VOICES OF THE YEARS
A FOLLOWER OF THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE GODS
TO PASS AND LEAVE UNCHANGED THE OLD DUSTY LAWS
SHALL THERE BE NO NEW TABLES NO NEW WORD
NO GREATER LIGHT COME DOWN UPON THE EARTH
DELIVERING HER FROM HER UNCONSCIOUSNESS
MAN'S SPIRIT FROM UNALTERABLE FATE
476
CAM'ST THOU NOT DOWN TO OPEN THE DOORS OF FATE
THE IRON DOORS THAT SEEMED FOR EVER CLOSED
AND LEAD MAN TO TRUTH'S WIDE AND GOLDEN ROAD
THAT RUNS THROUGH FINITE THINGS TO ETERNITY
IS THIS THEN THE REPORT THAT I MUST MAKE
MY HEAD BOWED WITH SHAME BEFORE THE ETERNAL'S SEAT
HIS POWER HE KINDLED IN THY BODY HAS FAILED
HIS LABOURER RETURNS HER TASK UNDONE
THEN SAVITRI'S HEART FELL MUTE IT SPOKE NO WORD
BUT HOLDING BACK HER TROUBLED REBEL HEART
ABRUPT ERECT AND STRONG CALM LIKE A HILL
SURMOUNTING THE SEAS OF MORTAL IGNORANCE
ITS PEAK IMMUTABLE ABOVE MIND'S AIR
A POWER WITHIN HER ANSWERED THE STILL VOICE
I AM THY PORTION HERE CHARGED WITH THY WORK
AS THOU MYSELF SEATED FOR EVER ABOVE
SPEAK TO MY DEPTHS O GREAT AND DEATHLESS VOICE
COMMAND FOR I AM HERE TO DO THY WILL
THE VOICE REPLIED REMEMBER WHY THOU CAM'ST
FIND OUT THY SOUL RECOVER THY HID SELF
IN SILENCE SEEK GOD'S MEANING IN THY DEPTHS
THEN MORTAL NATURE CHANGE TO THE DIVINE
OPEN GOD'S DOOR ENTER INTO HIS TRANCE
CAST THOUGHT FROM THEE THAT NIMBLE APE OF LIGHT
IN HIS TREMENDOUS HUSH STILLING THY BRAIN
HIS VAST TRUTH WAKE WITHIN AND KNOW AND SEE
CAST FROM THEE SENSE THAT VEILS THY SPIRIT'S SIGHT
IN THE ENORMOUS EMPTINESS OF THY MIND
THOU SHALT SEE THE ETERNAL'S BODY IN THE WORLD
KNOW HIM IN EVERY VOICE HEARD BY THY SOUL
IN THE WORLD'S CONTACTS MEET HIS SINGLE TOUCH
ALL THINGS SHALL FOLD THEE INTO HIS EMBRACE
CONQUER THY HEART'S THROBS LET THY HEART BEAT IN GOD
THY NATURE SHALL BE THE ENGINE OF HIS WORKS
THY VOICE SHALL HOUSE THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS WORD
THEN SHALT THOU HARBOUR MY FORCE AND CONQUER DEATH
477
THEN SAVITRI BY HER DOOMED HUSBAND SAT
STILL RIGID IN HER GOLDEN MOTIONLESS POSE
A STATUE OF THE FIRE OF THE INNER SUN
IN THE BLACK NIGHT THE WRATH OF STORM SWEPT BY
THE THUNDER CRASHED ABOVE HER THE RAIN HISSED
ITS MILLION FOOTSTEPS PATTERED ON THE ROOF
IMPASSIVE MID THE MOVEMENT AND THE CRY
WITNESS OF THE THOUGHTS OF MIND THE MOODS OF LIFE
SHE LOOKED INTO HERSELF AND SOUGHT FOR HER SOUL
A DREAM DISCLOSED TO HER THE COSMIC PAST
THE CRYPT-SEED AND THE MYSTIC ORIGINS
THE SHADOWY BEGINNINGS OF WORLD-FATE
A LAMP OF SYMBOL LIGHTING HIDDEN TRUTH
IMAGED TO HER THE WORLD'S SIGNIFICANCE
IN THE INDETERMINATE FORMLESSNESS OF SELF
CREATION TOOK ITS FIRST MYSTERIOUS STEPS
IT MADE THE BODY'S SHAPE A HOUSE OF SOUL
AND MATTER LEARNED TO THINK AND PERSON GREW
SHE SAW SPACE PEOPLED WITH THE SEEDS OF LIFE
AND SAW THE HUMAN CREATURE BORN IN TIME
AT FIRST APPEARED A DIM HALF-NEUTRAL TIDE
OF BEING EMERGING OUT OF INFINITE NOUGHT
A CONSCIOUSNESS LOOKED AT THE INCONSCIENT VAST
AND PLEASURE AND PAIN STIRRED IN THE INSENSIBLE VOID
ALL WAS THE DEED OF A BLIND WORLD-ENERGY
UNCONSCIOUS OF HER OWN EXPLOITS SHE WORKED
SHAPING A UNIVERSE OUT OF THE INANE
IN FRAGMENTARY BEINGS SHE GREW AWARE
A CHAOS OF LITTLE SENSIBILITIES
GATHERED ROUND A SMALL EGO'S PIN-POINT HEAD
IN IT A SENTIENT CREATURE FOUND ITS POISE
IT MOVED AND LIVED A BREATHING THINKING WHOLE
ON A DIM OCEAN OF SUBCONSCIENT LIFE
A FORMLESS SURFACE CONSCIOUSNESS AWOKE
A STREAM OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS CAME AND WENT
478
A FOAM OF MEMORIES HARDENED AND BECAME
A BRIGHT CRUST OF HABITUAL SENSE AND THOUGHT
A SEAT OF LIVING PERSONALITY
AND RECURRENT HABITS MIMICKED PERMANENCE
MIND NASCENT LABOURED OUT A MUTABLE FORM
IT BUILT A MOBILE HOUSE ON SHIFTING SANDS
A FLOATING ISLE UPON A BOTTOMLESS SEA
A CONSCIOUS BEING WAS BY THIS LABOUR MADE
IT LOOKED AROUND IT ON ITS DIFFICULT FIELD
IN THE GREEN WONDERFUL AND PERILOUS EARTH
IT HOPED IN A BRIEF BODY TO SURVIVE
RELYING ON MATTER'S FALSE ETERNITY
IT FELT A GODHEAD IN ITS FRAGILE HOUSE
IT SAW BLUE HEAVENS DREAMED IMMORTALITY
A CONSCIOUS SOUL IN THE INCONSCIENT'S WORLD
HIDDEN BEHIND OUR THOUGHTS AND HOPES AND DREAMS
AN INDIFFERENT MASTER SIGNING NATURE'S ACTS
LEAVES THE VICEGERENT MIND A SEEMING KING
IN HIS FLOATING HOUSE UPON THE SEA OF TIME
THE REGENT SITS AT WORK AND NEVER RESTS
HE IS A PUPPET OF THE DANCE OF TIME
HE IS DRIVEN BY THE HOURS THE MOMENT'S CALL
COMPELS HIM WITH THE THRONGING OF LIFE'S NEED
AND THE BABEL OF THE VOICES OF THE WORLD
THIS MIND NO SILENCE KNOWS NOR DREAMLESS SLEEP
IN THE INCESSANT CIRCLING OF ITS STEPS
THOUGHTS TREAD FOR EVER THROUGH THE LISTENING BRAIN
IT TOILS LIKE A MACHINE AND CANNOT STOP
INTO THE BODY'S MANY-STOREYED ROOMS
ENDLESS CROWD DOWN THE DREAM-GOD'S MESSAGES
ALL IS A HUNDRED-TONED MURMUR AND BABBLE AND STIR
THERE IS A TIRELESS RUNNING TO AND FRO
A HASTE OF MOVEMENT AND A CEASELESS CRY
THE HURRIED SERVANT SENSES ANSWER APACE
TO EVERY KNOCK UPON THE OUTER DOORS
BRING IN TIME'S VISITORS REPORT EACH CALL
479
ADMIT THE THOUSAND QUERIES AND THE CALLS
AND THE MESSAGES OF COMMUNICATING MINDS
AND THE HEAVY BUSINESS OF UNNUMBERED LIVES
AND ALL THE THOUSANDFOLD COMMERCE OF THE WORLD
EVEN IN THE TRACTS OF SLEEP IS SCANT REPOSE
HE MOCKS LIFE'S STEPS IN STRANGE SUBCONSCIENT DREAMS
HE STRAYS IN A SUBTLE REALM OF SYMBOL SCENES
HIS NIGHT WITH THIN-AIR VISIONS AND DIM FORMS
HE PACKS OR PEOPLES WITH SLIGHT DRIFTING SHAPES
AND ONLY A MOMENT SPENDS IN SILENT SELF
ADVENTURING INTO INFINITE MIND-SPACE
HE UNFOLDS HIS WINGS OF THOUGHT IN INNER AIR
OR TRAVELLING IN IMAGINATION'S CAR
CROSSES THE GLOBE JOURNEYS BENEATH THE STARS
TO SUBTLE WORLDS TAKES HIS ETHEREAL COURSE
VISITS THE GODS ON LIFE'S MIRACULOUS PEAKS
COMMUNICATES WITH HEAVEN TAMPERS WITH HELL
THIS IS THE LITTLE SURFACE OF MAN'S LIFE
HE IS THIS AND HE IS ALL THE UNIVERSE
HE SCALES THE UNSEEN HIS DEPTHS DARE THE ABYSS
A WHOLE MYSTERIOUS WORLD IS LOCKED WITHIN
UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF HE LIVES A HIDDEN KING
BEHIND RICH TAPESTRIES IN GREAT SECRET ROOMS
AN EPICURE OF THE SPIRIT'S UNSEEN JOYS
HE LIVES ON THE SWEET HONEY OF SOLITUDE
A NAMELESS GOD IN AN UNAPPROACHABLE FANE
IN THE SECRET ADYTUM OF HIS INMOST SOUL
HE GUARDS THE BEING'S COVERED MYSTERIES
BENEATH THE THRESHOLD BEHIND SHADOWY GATES
OR SHUT IN VAST CELLARS OF INCONSCIENT SLEEP
THE IMMACULATE DIVINE ALL-WONDERFUL
CASTS INTO THE ARGENT PURITY OF HIS SOUL
HIS SPLENDOUR AND HIS GREATNESS AND THE LIGHT
OF SELF-CREATION IN TIME'S INFINITY
AS INTO A SUBLIMELY MIRRORING GLASS
MAN IN THE WORLD'S LIFE WORKS OUT THE DREAMS OF GOD
480
BUT ALL IS THERE EVEN GOD'S OPPOSITES
HE IS A LITTLE FRONT OF NATURE'S WORKS
A THINKING OUTLINE OF A CRYPTIC FORCE
ALL SHE REVEALS IN HIM THAT IS IN HER
HER GLORIES WALK IN HIM AND HER DARKNESSES
MAN'S HOUSE OF LIFE HOLDS NOT THE GODS ALONE
THERE ARE OCCULT SHADOWS THERE ARE TENEBROUS POWERS
INHABITANTS OF LIFE'S OMINOUS NETHER ROOMS
A SHADOWY WORLD'S STUPENDOUS DENIZENS
A CARELESS GUARDIAN OF HIS NATURE'S POWERS
MAN HARBOURS DANGEROUS FORCES IN HIS HOUSE
THE TITAN AND THE FURY AND THE DJINN
LIE BOUND IN THE SUBCONSCIENT'S CAVERN PIT
AND THE BEAST GROVELS IN HIS ANTRE DEN
DIRE MUTTERINGS RISE AND MURMUR IN THEIR DROWSE
INSURGENT SOMETIMES RAISES ITS HUGE HEAD
A MONSTROUS MYSTERY LURKING IN LIFE'S DEEPS
THE MYSTERY OF DARK AND FALLEN WORLDS
THE DREAD VISAGES OF THE ADVERSARY KINGS
THE DREADFUL POWERS HELD DOWN WITHIN HIS DEPTHS
BECOME HIS MASTERS OR HIS MINISTERS
ENORMOUS THEY INVADE HIS BODILY HOUSE
CAN ACT IN HIS ACTS INFEST HIS THOUGHT AND LIFE
INFERNO SURGES INTO THE HUMAN AIR
AND TOUCHES ALL WITH A PERVERTING BREATH
GREY FORCES LIKE A THIN MIASMA CREEP
STEALING THROUGH CHINKS IN HIS CLOSED MANSION'S DOORS
DISCOLOURING THE WALLS OF UPPER MIND
IN WHICH HE LIVES HIS FAIR AND SPECIOUS LIFE
AND LEAVE BEHIND A STENCH OF SIN AND DEATH
NOT ONLY RISE IN HIM PERVERSE DRIFTS OF THOUGHT
AND FORMIDABLE FORMLESS INFLUENCES
BUT THERE COME PRESENCES AND AWFUL SHAPES
TREMENDOUS FORMS AND FACES MOUNT DIM STEPS
AND STARE AT TIMES INTO HIS LIVING-ROOMS
OR CALLED UP FOR A MOMENT'S PASSIONATE WORK
481
LAY A DIRE CUSTOM'S CLAIM UPON HIS HEART
AROUSED FROM SLEEP THEY CAN BE BOUND NO MORE
AFFLICTING THE DAYLIGHT AND ALARMING NIGHT
INVADING AT WILL HIS OUTER TENEMENT
THE STARK GLOOM'S GRISLY DIRE INHABITANTS
MOUNTING INTO GOD'S LIGHT ALL LIGHT PERTURB
ALL THEY HAVE TOUCHED OR SEEN THEY MAKE THEIR OWN
IN NATURE'S BASEMENT LODGE MIND'S PASSAGES FILL
DISRUPT THOUGHT'S LINKS AND MUSING SEQUENCES
BREAK THROUGH THE SOUL'S STILLNESS WITH A NOISE AND CRY
OR THEY CALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE ABYSS
INVITE THE INSTINCTS TO FORBIDDEN JOYS
A LAUGHTER WAKE OF DREAD DEMONIAC MIRTH
AND WITH NETHER RIOT AND REVEL SHAKE LIFE'S FLOOR
IMPOTENT TO QUELL HIS TERRIBLE PRISONERS
APPALLED THE HOUSEHOLDER HELPLESS SITS ABOVE
TAKEN FROM HIM HIS HOUSE IS HIS NO MORE
HE IS BOUND AND FORCED A VICTIM OF THE PLAY
OR ALLURED JOYS IN THE MAD AND MIGHTY DIN
HIS NATURE'S DANGEROUS FORCES HAVE ARISEN
AND HOLD AT WILL A REBEL'S HOLIDAY
AROUSED FROM THE DARKNESS WHERE THEY CROUCHED IN THE DEPTHS
PRISONED FROM THE SIGHT THEY CAN BE HELD NO MORE
HIS NATURE'S IMPULSES ARE NOW HIS LORDS
ONCE QUELLED OR WEARING SPECIOUS NAMES AND VESTS
INFERNAL ELEMENTS DEMON POWERS ARE THERE
MAN'S LOWER NATURE HIDES THESE AWFUL GUESTS
THEIR VAST CONTAGION GRIPS SOMETIMES MAN'S WORLD
AN AWFUL INSURGENCE OVERPOWERS MAN'S SOUL
IN HOUSE AND HOUSE THE HUGE UPRISING GROWS
HELL'S COMPANIES ARE LOOSED TO DO THEIR WORK
INTO THE EARTH-WAYS THEY BREAK OUT FROM ALL DOORS
INVADE WITH BLOOD-LUST AND THE WILL TO SLAY
AND FILL WITH HORROR AND CARNAGE GOD'S FAIR WORLD
DEATH AND HIS HUNTERS STALK A VICTIM EARTH
THE TERRIBLE ANGEL SMITES AT EVERY DOOR
482
AN AWFUL LAUGHTER MOCKS AT THE WORLD'S PAIN
AND MASSACRE AND TORTURE GRIN AT HEAVEN
ALL IS THE PREY OF THE DESTROYING FORCE
CREATION ROCKS AND TREMBLE TOP AND BASE
THIS EVIL NATURE HOUSED IN HUMAN HEARTS
A FOREIGN INHABITANT A DANGEROUS GUEST
THE SOUL THAT HARBOURS IT IT CAN DISLODGE
EXPEL THE HOUSEHOLDER POSSESS THE HOUSE
AN OPPOSITE POTENCY CONTRADICTING GOD
A MOMENTARY EVIL'S ALMIGHTINESS
HAS STRADDLED THE STRAIGHT PATH OF NATURE'S ACTS
IT IMITATES THE GODHEAD IT DENIES
PUTS ON HIS FIGURE AND ASSUMES HIS FACE
A MANICHEAN CREATOR AND DESTROYER
THIS CAN ABOLISH MAN ANNUL HIS WORLD
BUT THERE IS A GUARDIAN POWER THERE ARE HANDS THAT SAVE
CALM EYES DIVINE REGARD THE HUMAN SCENE
ALL THE WORLD'S POSSIBILITIES IN MAN
ARE WAITING AS THE TREE WAITS IN ITS SEED
HIS PAST LIVES IN HIM IT DRIVES HIS FUTURE'S PACE
HIS PRESENT'S ACTS FASHION HIS COMING FATE
THE UNBORN GODS HIDE IN HIS HOUSE OF LIFE
THE DAEMONS OF THE UNKNOWN OVERSHADOW HIS MIND
CASTING THEIR DREAMS INTO LIVE MOULDS OF THOUGHT
THE MOULDS IN WHICH HIS MIND BUILDS OUT ITS WORLD
HIS MIND CREATES AROUND HIM ITS UNIVERSE
ALL THAT HAS BEEN RENEWS IN HIM ITS BIRTH
ALL THAT CAN BE IS FIGURED IN HIS SOUL
ISSUING IN DEEDS IT SCORES ON THE ROADS OF THE WORLD
OBSCURE TO THE INTERPRETING REASON'S GUESS
LINES OF THE SECRET PURPOSE OF THE GODS
IN STRANGE DIRECTIONS RUNS THE INTRICATE PLAN
HELD BACK FROM HUMAN FORESIGHT IS THEIR END
AND THE FAR INTENTION OF SOME ORDERING WILL
OR THE ORDER OF LIFE'S ARBITRARY CHANCE
483
FINDS OUT ITS SETTLED POISE AND FATED HOUR
OUR SURFACE WATCHED IN VAIN BY REASON'S GAZE
INVADED BY THE IMPROMPTUS OF THE UNSEEN
HELPLESS RECORDS THE ACCIDENTS OF TIME
THE INVOLUNTARY TURNS AND LEAPS OF LIFE
ONLY A LITTLE OF US FORESEES ITS STEPS
ONLY A LITTLE HAS WILL AND PURPOSED PACE
A VAST SUBLIMINAL IS MAN'S MEASURELESS PART
THE DIM SUBCONSCIENT IS HIS CAVERN BASE
ABOLISHED VAINLY IN THE WALKS OF TIME
OUR PAST LIVES STILL IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS SELVES
AND BY THE WEIGHT OF ITS HIDDEN INFLUENCES
IS SHAPED OUR FUTURE'S SELF-DISCOVERY
THUS ALL IS AN INEVITABLE CHAIN
AND YET A SERIES SEEMS OF ACCIDENTS
THE UNREMEMBERING HOURS REPEAT THE OLD ACTS
OUR DEAD PAST ROUND OUR FUTURE'S ANKLES CLINGS
AND DRAGS BACK THE NEW NATURE'S GLORIOUS STRIDE
OR FROM ITS BURIED CORPSE OLD GHOSTS ARISE
OLD THOUGHTS OLD LONGINGS DEAD PASSIONS LIVE AGAIN
RECUR IN SLEEP OR MOVE THE WAKING MAN
TO WORDS THAT FORCE THE BARRIER OF THE LIPS
TO DEEDS THAT SUDDENLY START AND O'ERLEAP
HIS HEAD OF REASON AND HIS GUARDIAN WILL
AN OLD SELF LURKS IN THE NEW SELF WE ARE
HARDLY WE ESCAPE FROM WHAT WE ONCE HAD BEEN
IN THE DIM GLEAM OF HABIT'S PASSAGES
IN THE SUBCONSCIENT'S DARKLING CORRIDORS
ALL THINGS ARE CARRIED BY THE PORTER NERVES
AND NOTHING CHECKED BY SUBTERRANEAN MIND
UNSTUDIED BY THE GUARDIANS OF THE DOORS
AND PASSED BY A BLIND INSTINCTIVE MEMORY
THE OLD GANG DISMISSED OLD CANCELLED PASSPORTS SERVE
NOTHING IS WHOLLY DEAD THAT ONCE HAD LIVED
IN DIM TUNNELS OF THE WORLD'S BEING AND IN OURS
THE OLD REJECTED NATURE STILL SURVIVES
484
THE CORPSES OF ITS SLAIN THOUGHTS RAISE THEIR HEADS
AND VISIT MIND'S NOCTURNAL WALKS IN SLEEP
ITS STIFLED IMPULSES BREATHE AND MOVE AND RISE
ALL KEEPS A PHANTOM IMMORTALITY
IRRESISTIBLE ARE NATURE'S SEQUENCES
THE SEEDS OF SINS RENOUNCED SPROUT FROM HID SOIL
THE EVIL CAST FROM OUR HEARTS ONCE MORE WE FACE
OUR DEAD SELVES COME TO SLAY OUR LIVING SOUL
A PORTION OF US LIVES IN PRESENT TIME
A SECRET MASS IN DIM INCONSCIENCE GROPES
OUT OF THE INCONSCIENT AND SUBLIMINAL
ARISEN WE LIVE IN MIND'S UNCERTAIN LIGHT
AND STRIVE TO KNOW AND MASTER A DUBIOUS WORLD
WHOSE PURPOSE AND MEANING ARE HIDDEN FROM OUR SIGHT
ABOVE US DWELLS A SUPERCONSCIENT GOD
HIDDEN IN THE MYSTERY OF HIS OWN LIGHT
AROUND US IS A VAST OF IGNORANCE
LIT BY THE UNCERTAIN RAY OF HUMAN MIND
BELOW US SLEEPS THE INCONSCIENT DARK AND MUTE
BUT THIS IS ONLY MATTER'S FIRST SELF-VIEW
A SCALE AND SERIES IN THE IGNORANCE
THIS IS NOT ALL WE ARE OR ALL OUR WORLD
OUR GREATER SELF OF KNOWLEDGE WAITS FOR US
A SUPREME LIGHT IN THE TRUTH-CONSCIOUS VAST
IT SEES FROM SUMMITS BEYOND THINKING MIND
IT MOVES IN A SPLENDID AIR TRANSCENDING LIFE
IT SHALL DESCEND AND MAKE EARTH'S LIFE DIVINE
TRUTH MADE THE WORLD NOT A BLIND NATURE-FORCE
FOR HERE ARE NOT OUR LARGE DIVINER HEIGHTS
OUR SUMMITS IN THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S BLAZE
ARE GLORIOUS WITH THE VERY FACE OF GOD
THERE IS OUR ASPECT OF ETERNITY
THERE IS THE FIGURE OF THE GOD WE ARE
HIS YOUNG UNAGING LOOK ON DEATHLESS THINGS
HIS JOY IN OUR ESCAPE FROM DEATH AND TIME
HIS IMMORTALITY AND LIGHT AND BLISS
485
OUR LARGER BEING SITS BEHIND CRYPTIC WALLS
THERE ARE GREATNESSES HIDDEN IN OUR UNSEEN PARTS
THAT WAIT THEIR HOUR TO STEP INTO LIFE'S FRONT
WE FEEL AN AID FROM DEEP INDWELLING GODS
ONE SPEAKS WITHIN LIGHT COMES TO US FROM ABOVE
OUR SOUL FROM ITS MYSTERIOUS CHAMBER ACTS
ITS INFLUENCE PRESSING ON OUR HEART AND MIND
PUSHES THEM TO EXCEED THEIR MORTAL SELVES
IT SEEKS FOR GOOD AND BEAUTY AND FOR GOD
WE SEE BEYOND SELF'S WALLS OUR LIMITLESS SELF
WE GAZE THROUGH OUR WORLD'S GLASS AT HALF-SEEN VASTS
WE HUNT FOR THE TRUTH BEHIND APPARENT THINGS
OUR INNER MIND DWELLS IN A LARGER LIGHT
ITS BRIGHTNESS LOOKS AT US THROUGH HIDDEN DOORS
OUR MEMBERS LUMINOUS GROW AND WISDOM'S FACE
APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY OF THE MYSTIC WARD
WHEN SHE ENTERS INTO OUR HOUSE OF OUTWARD SENSE
THEN WE LOOK UP AND SEE ABOVE HER SUN
A MIGHTY LIFE-SELF WITH ITS INNER POWERS
SUPPORTS THE DWARFISH MODICUM WE CALL LIFE
IT CAN GRAFT UPON OUR CRAWL TWO PUISSANT WINGS
OUR BODY'S SUBTLE SELF IS THRONED WITHIN
IN ITS VIEWLESS PALACE OF VERIDICAL DREAMS
THAT ARE BRIGHT SHADOWS OF THE THOUGHTS OF GOD
IN THE PRONE OBSCURE BEGINNINGS OF THE RACE
THE HUMAN GREW IN THE BOWED APELIKE MAN
HE STOOD ERECT A GODLIKE FORM AND FORCE
AND A SOUL'S THOUGHTS LOOKED OUT FROM EARTH-BORN EYES
MAN STOOD ERECT HE WORE THE THINKER'S BROW
HE LOOKED AT HEAVEN AND SAW HIS COMRADE STARS
A VISION CAME OF BEAUTY AND GREATER BIRTH
SLOWLY EMERGING FROM THE HEART'S CHAPEL OF LIGHT
AND MOVED IN A WHITE LUCENT AIR OF DREAMS
HE SAW HIS BEING'S UNREALISED VASTNESSES
HE ASPIRED AND HOUSED THE NASCENT DEMIGOD
OUT OF THE DIM RECESSES OF THE SELF
486
THE OCCULT SEEKER INTO THE OPEN CAME
HE HEARD THE FAR AND TOUCHED THE INTANGIBLE
HE GAZED INTO THE FUTURE AND THE UNSEEN
HE USED THE POWERS EARTH-INSTRUMENTS CANNOT USE
A PASTIME MADE OF THE IMPOSSIBLE
HE CAUGHT UP FRAGMENTS OF THE OMNISCIENT'S THOUGHT
HE SCATTERED FORMULAS OF OMNIPOTENCE
THUS MAN IN HIS LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF EARTH'S DUST
GREW TOWARDS AN UNSEEN HEAVEN OF THOUGHT AND DREAM
LOOKING INTO THE VAST VISTAS OF HIS MIND
ON A SMALL GLOBE DOTTING INFINITY
AT LAST CLIMBING A LONG AND NARROW STAIR
HE STOOD ALONE ON THE HIGH ROOF OF THINGS
AND SAW THE LIGHT OF A SPIRITUAL SUN
ASPIRING HE TRANSCENDS HIS EARTHLY SELF
HE STANDS IN THE LARGENESS OF HIS SOUL NEW-BORN
REDEEMED FROM ENCIRCLEMENT BY MORTAL THINGS
AND MOVES IN A PURE FREE SPIRITUAL REALM
AS IN THE RARE BREATH OF A STRATOSPHERE
A LAST END OF FAR LINES OF DIVINITY
HE MOUNTS BY A FRAIL THREAD TO HIS HIGH SOURCE
HE REACHES HIS FOUNT OF IMMORTALITY
HE CALLS THE GODHEAD INTO HIS MORTAL LIFE
ALL THIS THE SPIRIT CONCEALED HAD DONE IN HER
A PORTION OF THE MIGHTY MOTHER CAME
INTO HER AS INTO ITS OWN HUMAN PART
AMID THE COSMIC WORKINGS OF THE GODS
IT MARKED HER THE CENTRE OF A WIDE-DRAWN SCHEME
DREAMED IN THE PASSION OF HER FAR-SEEING SPIRIT
TO MOULD HUMANITY INTO GOD'S OWN SHAPE
AND LEAD THIS GREAT BLIND STRUGGLING WORLD TO LIGHT
OR A NEW WORLD DISCOVER OR CREATE
EARTH MUST TRANSFORM HERSELF AND EQUAL HEAVEN
OR HEAVEN DESCEND INTO EARTH'S MORTAL STATE
BUT FOR SUCH VAST SPIRITUAL CHANGE TO BE
OUT OF THE MYSTIC CAVERN IN MAN'S HEART
487
THE HEAVENLY PSYCHE MUST PUT OFF HER VEIL
AND STEP INTO COMMON NATURE'S CROWDED ROOMS
AND STAND UNCOVERED IN THAT NATURE'S FRONT
AND RULE ITS THOUGHTS AND FILL THE BODY AND LIFE
OBEDIENT TO A HIGH COMMAND SHE SAT
TIME LIFE AND DEATH WERE PASSING INCIDENTS
OBSTRUCTING WITH THEIR TRANSIENT VIEW HER SIGHT
HER SIGHT THAT MUST BREAK THROUGH AND LIBERATE THE GOD
IMPRISONED IN THE VISIONLESS MORTAL MAN
THE INFERIOR NATURE BORN INTO IGNORANCE
STILL TOOK TOO LARGE A PLACE IT VEILED HER SELF
AND MUST BE PUSHED ASIDE TO FIND HER SOUL
488
AT FIRST OUT OF THE BUSY HUM OF MIND
AS IF FROM A LOUD THRONGED MARKET INTO A CAVE
BY AN INWARD MOMENT'S MAGIC SHE HAD COME
A STARK HUSHED EMPTINESS BECAME HER SELF
HER MIND UNVISITED BY THE VOICE OF THOUGHT
STARED AT A VOID DEEP'S DUMB INFINITY
HER HEIGHTS RECEDED HER DEPTHS BEHIND HER CLOSED
ALL FLED AWAY FROM HER AND LEFT HER BLANK
BUT WHEN SHE CAME BACK TO HER SELF OF THOUGHT
ONCE MORE SHE WAS A HUMAN THING ON EARTH
A LUMP OF MATTER A HOUSE OF CLOSED SIGHT
A MIND COMPELLED TO THINK OUT IGNORANCE
A LIFE-FORCE PRESSED INTO A CAMP OF WORKS
AND THE MATERIAL WORLD HER LIMITING FIELD
AMAZED LIKE ONE UNKNOWING SHE SOUGHT HER WAY
OUT OF THE TANGLE OF MAN'S IGNORANT PAST
THAT TOOK THE SURFACE PERSON FOR THE SOUL
THEN A VOICE SPOKE THAT DWELT ON SECRET HEIGHTS
FOR MAN THOU SEEKST NOT FOR THYSELF ALONE
ONLY IF GOD ASSUMES THE HUMAN MIND
AND PUTS ON MORTAL IGNORANCE FOR HIS CLOAK
AND MAKES HIMSELF THE DWARF WITH TRIPLE STRIDE
CAN HE HELP MAN TO GROW INTO THE GOD
AS MAN DISGUISED THE COSMIC GREATNESS WORKS
AND FINDS THE MYSTIC INACCESSIBLE GATE
AND OPENS THE IMMORTAL'S GOLDEN DOOR
MAN HUMAN FOLLOWS IN GOD'S HUMAN STEPS
ACCEPTING HIS DARKNESS THOU MUST BRING TO HIM LIGHT
ACCEPTING HIS SORROW THOU MUST BRING TO HIM BLISS
IN MATTER'S BODY FIND THY HEAVEN-BORN SOUL
THEN SAVITRI SURGED OUT OF HER BODY'S WALL
489
AND STOOD A LITTLE SPAN OUTSIDE HERSELF
AND LOOKED INTO HER SUBTLE BEING'S DEPTHS
AND IN ITS HEART AS IN A LOTUS-BUD
DIVINED HER SECRET AND MYSTERIOUS SOUL
AT THE DIM PORTAL OF THE INNER LIFE
THAT BARS OUT FROM OUR DEPTHS THE BODY'S MIND
AND ALL THAT LIVES BUT BY THE BODY'S BREATH
SHE KNOCKED AND PRESSED AGAINST THE EBONY GATE
THE LIVING PORTAL GROANED WITH SULLEN HINGE
HEAVILY RELUCTANT IT COMPLAINED INERT
AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF THE SPIRIT'S TOUCH
A FORMIDABLE VOICE CRIED FROM WITHIN
BACK CREATURE OF EARTH LEST TORTURED AND TORN THOU DIE
A DREADFUL MURMUR ROSE LIKE A DIM SEA
THE SERPENT OF THE THRESHOLD HISSING ROSE
A FATAL GUARDIAN HOOD WITH MONSTROUS COILS
THE HOUNDS OF DARKNESS GROWLED WITH JAWS AGAPE
AND TROLLS AND GNOMES AND GOBLINS SCOWLED AND STARED
AND WILD BEAST ROARINGS THRILLED THE BLOOD WITH FEAR
AND MENACE MUTTERED IN A DANGEROUS TONGUE
UNSHAKEN HER WILL PRESSED ON THE RIGID BARS
THE GATE SWUNG WIDE WITH A PROTESTING JAR
THE OPPONENT POWERS WITHDREW THEIR DREADFUL GUARD
HER BEING ENTERED INTO THE INNER WORLDS
IN A NARROW PASSAGE THE SUBCONSCIENT'S GATE
SHE BREATHED WITH DIFFICULTY AND PAIN AND STROVE
TO FIND THE INNER SELF CONCEALED IN SENSE
INTO A DENSE OF SUBTLE MATTER PACKED
A CAVITY FILLED WITH A BLIND MASS OF POWER
AN OPPOSITION OF MISLEADING GLEAMS
A HEAVY BARRIER OF UNSEEING SIGHT
SHE FORCED HER WAY THROUGH BODY TO THE SOUL
ACROSS A PERILOUS BORDER LINE SHE PASSED
WHERE LIFE DIPS INTO THE SUBCONSCIENT DUSK
OR STRUGGLES FROM MATTER INTO CHAOS OF MIND
ASWARM WITH ELEMENTAL ENTITIES
490
AND FLUTTERING SHAPES OF VAGUE HALF-BODIED THOUGHT
AND CRUDE BEGINNINGS OF INCONTINENT FORCE
AT FIRST A DIFFICULT NARROWNESS WAS THERE
A PRESS OF UNCERTAIN POWERS AND DRIFTING WILLS
FOR ALL WAS THERE BUT NOTHING IN ITS PLACE
AT TIMES AN OPENING CAME A DOOR WAS FORCED
SHE CROSSED THROUGH SPACES OF A SECRET SELF
AND TROD IN PASSAGES OF INNER TIME
AT LAST SHE BROKE INTO A FORM OF THINGS
A START OF FINITENESS A WORLD OF SENSE
BUT ALL WAS STILL CONFUSED NOTHING SELF-FOUND
SOUL WAS NOT THERE BUT ONLY CRIES OF LIFE
A THRONGED AND CLAMOROUS AIR ENVIRONED HER
A HORDE OF SOUNDS DEFIED SIGNIFICANCE
A DISSONANT CLASH OF CRIES AND CONTRARY CALLS
A MOB OF VISIONS BROKE ACROSS THE SIGHT
A JOSTLED SEQUENCE LACKING SENSE AND SUITE
FEELINGS PUSHED THROUGH A PACKED AND BURDENED HEART
EACH FORCED ITS SEPARATE INCONSEQUENT WAY
BUT CARED FOR NOTHING BUT ITS EGO'S DRIVE
A RALLY WITHOUT KEY OF COMMON WILL
THOUGHT STARED AT THOUGHT AND PULLED AT THE TAUT BRAIN
AS IF TO PLUCK THE REASON FROM ITS SEAT
AND CAST ITS CORPSE INTO LIFE'S WAYSIDE DRAIN
SO MIGHT FORGOTTEN LIE IN NATURE'S MUD
ABANDONED THE SLAIN SENTINEL OF THE SOUL
SO COULD LIFE'S POWER SHAKE FROM IT MIND'S RULE
NATURE RENOUNCE THE SPIRIT'S GOVERNMENT
AND THE BARE ELEMENTAL ENERGIES
MAKE OF THE SENSE A GLORY OF BOUNDLESS JOY
A SPLENDOUR OF ECSTATIC ANARCHY
A REVEL MIGHTY AND MAD OF UTTER BLISS
THIS WAS THE SENSE'S INSTINCT VOID OF SOUL
OR WHEN THE SOUL SLEEPS HIDDEN VOID OF POWER
BUT NOW THE VITAL GODHEAD WAKES WITHIN
AND LIFTS THE LIFE WITH THE SUPERNAL'S TOUCH
491
BUT HOW SHALL COME THE GLORY AND THE FLAME
IF MIND IS CAST AWAY INTO THE ABYSS
FOR BODY WITHOUT MIND HAS NOT THE LIGHT
THE RAPTURE OF SPIRIT SENSE THE JOY OF LIFE
ALL THEN BECOMES SUBCONSCIENT TENEBROUS
INCONSCIENCE PUTS ITS SEAL ON NATURE'S PAGE
OR ELSE A MAD DISORDER WHIRLS THE BRAIN
POSTING ALONG A RAVAGED NATURE'S ROADS
A CHAOS OF DISORDERED IMPULSES
IN WHICH NO LIGHT CAN COME NO JOY NO PEACE
THIS STATE NOW THREATENED THIS SHE PUSHED FROM HER
AS IF IN A LONG ENDLESS TOSSING STREET
ONE DRIVEN MID A TRAMPLING HURRYING CROWD
HOUR AFTER HOUR SHE TROD WITHOUT RELEASE
HOLDING BY HER WILL THE SENSELESS MEUTE AT BAY
OUT OF THE DREADFUL PRESS SHE DRAGGED HER WILL
AND FIXED HER THOUGHT UPON THE SAVIOUR NAME
THEN ALL GREW STILL AND EMPTY SHE WAS FREE
A LARGE DELIVERANCE CAME A VAST CALM SPACE
AWHILE SHE MOVED THROUGH A BLANK TRANQUILLITY
OF NAKED LIGHT FROM AN INVISIBLE SUN
A VOID THAT WAS A BODILESS HAPPINESS
A BLISSFUL VACUUM OF NAMELESS PEACE
BUT NOW A MIGHTIER DANGER'S FRONT DREW NEAR
THE PRESS OF BODILY MIND THE INCONSCIENT'S BROOD
OF AIMLESS THOUGHT AND WILL HAD FALLEN FROM HER
APPROACHING LOOMED A GIANT HEAD OF LIFE
UNGOVERNED BY MIND OR SOUL SUBCONSCIENT VAST
IT TOSSED ALL POWER INTO A SINGLE DRIVE
IT MADE ITS POWER A MIGHT OF DANGEROUS SEAS
INTO THE STILLNESS OF HER SILENT SELF
INTO THE WHITENESS OF ITS MUSE OF SPACE
A SPATE A TORRENT OF THE SPEED OF LIFE
BROKE LIKE A WIND-LASHED DRIVEN MOB OF WAVES
RACING ON A PALE FLOOR OF SUMMER SAND
IT DROWNED ITS BANKS A MOUNTAIN OF CLIMBING WAVES
492
ENORMOUS WAS ITS VAST AND PASSIONATE VOICE
IT CRIED TO HER LISTENING SPIRIT AS IT RAN
DEMANDING GOD'S SUBMISSION TO CHAINLESS FORCE
A DEAF FORCE CALLING TO A STATUS DUMB
A THOUSAND VOICES IN A MUTED VAST
IT CLAIMED THE HEART'S SUPPORT FOR ITS CLUTCH AT JOY
FOR ITS NEED TO ACT THE WITNESS SOUL'S CONSENT
FOR ITS LUST OF POWER HER NEUTRAL BEING'S SEAL
INTO THE WIDENESS OF HER WATCHING SELF
IT BROUGHT A GRANDIOSE GUST OF THE BREATH OF LIFE
ITS TORRENT CARRIED THE WORLD'S HOPES AND FEARS
ALL LIFE'S ALL NATURE'S DISSATISFIED HUNGRY CRY
AND THE LONGING ALL ETERNITY CANNOT FILL
IT CALLED TO THE MOUNTAIN SECRECIES OF THE SOUL
AND THE MIRACLE OF THE NEVER-DYING FIRE
IT SPOKE TO SOME FIRST INEXPRESSIBLE ECSTASY
HIDDEN IN THE CREATIVE BEAT OF LIFE
OUT OF THE NETHER UNSEEN DEEPS IT TORE
ITS LURE AND MAGIC OF DISORDERED BLISS
INTO EARTH-LIGHT POURED ITS MAZE OF TANGLED CHARM
AND HEADY DRAUGHT OF NATURE'S PRIMITIVE JOY
AND THE FIRE AND MYSTERY OF FORBIDDEN DELIGHT
DRUNK FROM THE WORLD-LIBIDO'S BOTTOMLESS WELL
AND THE HONEY-SWEET POISON-WINE OF LUST AND DEATH
BUT DREAMED A VINTAGE OF GLORY OF LIFE'S GODS
AND FELT AS CELESTIAL RAPTURE'S GOLDEN STING
THE CYCLES OF THE INFINITY OF DESIRE
AND THE MYSTIQUE THAT MADE AN UNREALISED WORLD
WIDER THAN THE KNOWN AND CLOSER THAN THE UNKNOWN
IN WHICH HUNT FOR EVER THE HOUNDS OF MIND AND LIFE
TEMPTED A DEEP DISSATISFIED URGE WITHIN
TO LONG FOR THE UNFULFILLED AND EVER FAR
AND MAKE THIS LIFE UPON A LIMITING EARTH
A CLIMB TOWARDS SUMMITS VANISHING IN THE VOID
A SEARCH FOR THE GLORY OF THE IMPOSSIBLE
IT DREAMED OF THAT WHICH NEVER HAS BEEN KNOWN
493
IT GRASPED AT THAT WHICH NEVER HAS BEEN WON
IT CHASED INTO AN ELYSIAN MEMORY
THE CHARMS THAT FLEE FROM THE HEART'S SOON LOST DELIGHT
IT DARED THE FORCE THAT SLAYS THE JOYS THAT HURT
THE IMAGED SHAPE OF UNACCOMPLISHED THINGS
AND THE SUMMONS TO A CIRCEAN TRANSMUTING DANCE
AND PASSION'S TENANCY OF THE COURTS OF LOVE
AND THE WILD BEAST'S RAMP AND ROMP WITH BEAUTY AND LIFE
IT BROUGHT ITS CRY AND SURGE OF OPPOSITE POWERS
ITS MOMENTS OF THE TOUCH OF LUMINOUS PLANES
ITS FLAME-ASCENSIONS AND SKY-PITCHED VAST ATTEMPTS
ITS FIERY TOWERS OF DREAM BUILT ON THE WINDS
ITS SINKINGS TOWARDS THE DARKNESS AND THE ABYSS
ITS HONEY OF TENDERNESS ITS SHARP WINE OF HATE
ITS CHANGES OF SUN AND CLOUD OF LAUGHTER AND TEARS
ITS BOTTOMLESS DANGER-PITS AND SWALLOWING GULFS
ITS FEAR AND JOY AND ECSTASY AND DESPAIR
ITS OCCULT WIZARDRIES ITS SIMPLE LINES
AND GREAT COMMUNIONS AND UPLIFTING MOVES
ITS FAITH IN HEAVEN ITS INTERCOURSE WITH HELL
THESE POWERS WERE NOT BLUNT WITH THE DEAD WEIGHT OF EARTH
THEY GAVE AMBROSIA'S TASTE AND POISON'S STING
THERE WAS AN ARDOUR IN THE GAZE OF LIFE
THAT SAW HEAVEN BLUE IN THE GREY AIR OF NIGHT
THE IMPULSES GODWARD SOARED ON PASSION'S WINGS
MIND'S QUICK-PACED THOUGHTS FLOATED FROM THEIR HIGH NECKS
A GLOWING SPLENDOUR AS OF AN IRISED MANE
A PARURE OF PURE INTUITION'S LIGHT
ITS FLAME-FOOT GALLOP THEY COULD IMITATE
MIND'S VOICES MIMICKED INSPIRATION'S STRESS
ITS ICTUS OF INFALLIBILITY
ITS SPEED AND LIGHTNING HEAVEN-LEAP OF THE GODS
A TRENCHANT BLADE THAT SHORE THE NETS OF DOUBT
ITS SWORD OF DISCERNMENT SEEMED ALMOST DIVINE
YET ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE WAS A BORROWED SUN'S
THE FORMS THAT CAME WERE NOT HEAVEN'S NATIVE BIRTHS
494
AN INNER VOICE COULD SPEAK THE UNREAL'S WORD
ITS PUISSANCE DANGEROUS AND ABSOLUTE
COULD MINGLE POISON WITH THE WINE OF GOD
ON THESE HIGH SHINING BACKS FALSEHOOD COULD RIDE
TRUTH LAY WITH DELIGHT IN ERROR'S PASSIONATE ARMS
GLIDING DOWNSTREAM IN A BLITHE GILDED BARGE
SHE EDGED HER RAY WITH A MAGNIFICENT LIE
HERE IN LIFE'S NETHER REALMS ALL CONTRARIES MEET
TRUTH STARES AND DOES HER WORKS WITH BANDAGED EYES
AND IGNORANCE IS WISDOM'S PATRON HERE
THOSE GALLOPING HOOVES IN THEIR ENTHUSIAST SPEED
COULD BEAR TO A DANGEROUS INTERMEDIATE ZONE
WHERE DEATH WALKS WEARING A ROBE OF DEATHLESS LIFE
OR THEY ENTER THE VALLEY OF THE WANDERING GLEAM
WHENCE CAPTIVES OR VICTIMS OF THE SPECIOUS RAY
SOULS TRAPPED IN THAT REGION NEVER CAN ESCAPE
AGENTS NOT MASTERS THEY SERVE LIFE'S DESIRES
TOILING FOR EVER IN THE SNARE OF TIME
THEIR BODIES BORN OUT OF SOME NIHIL'S WOMB
ENSNARE THE SPIRIT IN THE MOMENT'S DREAMS
THEN PERISH VOMITING THE IMMORTAL SOUL
OUT OF MATTER'S BELLY INTO THE SINK OF NOUGHT
YET SOME UNCAUGHT UNSLAIN CAN WARILY PASS
CARRYING TRUTH'S IMAGE IN THE SHELTERED HEART
PLUCK KNOWLEDGE OUT OF ERROR'S SCREENING GRIP
BREAK PATHS THROUGH THE BLIND WALLS OF LITTLE SELF
THEN TRAVEL ON TO REACH A GREATER LIFE
ALL THIS STREAMED PAST HER AND SEEMED TO HER VISION'S SIGHT
AS IF AROUND A HIGH AND VOICELESS ISLE
A CLAMOUR OF WATERS FROM FAR UNKNOWN HILLS
SWALLOWED ITS NARROW BANKS IN CROWDING WAVES
AND MADE A HUNGRY WORLD OF WHITE WILD FOAM
HASTENING A DRAGON WITH A MILLION FEET
ITS FOAM AND CRY A DRUNKEN GIANT'S DIN
TOSSING A MANE OF DARKNESS INTO GOD'S SKY
IT EBBED RECEDING INTO A DISTANT ROAR
495
THEN SMILED AGAIN A LARGE AND TRANQUIL AIR
BLUE HEAVEN GREEN EARTH PARTNERS OF BEAUTY'S REIGN
LIVED AS OF OLD COMPANIONS IN HAPPINESS
AND IN THE WORLD'S HEART LAUGHED THE JOY OF LIFE
ALL NOW WAS STILL THE SOIL SHONE DRY AND PURE
THROUGH IT ALL SHE MOVED NOT PLUNGED NOT IN THE VAIN WAVES
OUT OF THE VASTNESS OF THE SILENT SELF
LIFE'S CLAMOUR FLED HER SPIRIT WAS MUTE AND FREE
THEN JOURNEYING FORWARD THROUGH THE SELF'S WIDE HUSH
SHE CAME INTO A BRILLIANT ORDERED SPACE
THERE LIFE DWELT PARKED IN AN ARMED TRANQUILLITY
A CHAIN WAS ON HER STRONG INSURGENT HEART
TAMED TO THE MODESTY OF A MEASURED PACE
SHE KEPT NO MORE HER VEHEMENT STRIDE AND RUSH
SHE HAD LOST THE CARELESS MAJESTY OF HER MUSE
AND THE AMPLE GRANDEUR OF HER REGAL FORCE
CURBED WERE HER MIGHTY POMPS HER SPLENDID WASTE
SOBERED THE REVELS OF HER BACCHANT PLAY
CUT DOWN WERE HER SQUANDERINGS IN DESIRE'S BAZAAR
COERCED HER DESPOT WILL HER FANCY'S DANCE
A COLD STOLIDITY BOUND THE RIOT OF SENSE
A ROYALTY WITHOUT FREEDOM WAS HER LOT
THE SOVEREIGN THRONED OBEYED HER MINISTERS
HER SERVANTS MIND AND SENSE GOVERNED HER HOUSE
HER SPIRIT'S BOUNDS THEY CAST IN RIGID LINES
AND GUARDING WITH A PHALANX OF ARMOURED RULES
THE REASON'S BALANCED REIGN KEPT ORDER AND PEACE
HER WILL LIVED CLOSED IN ADAMANT WALLS OF LAW
COERCED WAS HER FORCE BY CHAINS THAT FEIGNED TO ADORN
IMAGINATION WAS PRISONED IN A FORT
HER WANTON AND LICENTIOUS FAVOURITE
REALITY'S POISE AND REASON'S SYMMETRY
WERE SET IN ITS PLACE SENTINELLED BY MARSHALLED FACTS
THEY GAVE TO THE SOUL FOR THRONE A BENCH OF LAW
FOR KINGDOM A SMALL WORLD OF RULE AND LINE
496
THE AGES' WISDOM SHRIVELLED TO SCHOLIAST LINES
SHRANK PATTERNED INTO A COPY-BOOK DEVICE
THE SPIRIT'S ALMIGHTY FREEDOM WAS NOT HERE
A SCHOOLMAN MIND HAD CAPTURED LIFE'S LARGE SPACE
BUT CHOSE TO LIVE IN BARE AND PALTRY ROOMS
PARKED OFF FROM THE TOO VAST DANGEROUS UNIVERSE
FEARING TO LOSE ITS SOUL IN THE INFINITE
EVEN THE IDEA'S AMPLE SWEEP WAS CUT
INTO A SYSTEM CHAINED TO FIXED PILLARS OF THOUGHT
OR RIVETTED TO MATTER'S SOLID GROUND
OR ELSE THE SOUL WAS LOST IN ITS OWN HEIGHTS
OBEYING THE IDEAL'S HIGH-BROWED LAW
THOUGHT BASED A THRONE ON UNSUBSTANTIAL AIR
DISDAINING EARTH'S FLAT TRIVIALITY
IT BARRED REALITY OUT TO LIVE IN ITS DREAMS
OR ALL STEPPED INTO A SYSTEMED UNIVERSE
LIFE'S EMPIRE WAS A MANAGED CONTINENT
ITS THOUGHTS AN ARMY RANKED AND DISCIPLINED
UNIFORMED THEY KEPT THE LOGIC OF THEIR FIXED PLACE
AT THE BIDDING OF THE TRAINED CENTURION MIND
OR EACH STEPPED INTO ITS STATION LIKE A STAR
OR MARCHED THROUGH FIXED AND CONSTELLATED HEAVENS
OR KEPT ITS FEUDAL RANK AMONG ITS PEERS
IN THE SKY'S UNCHANGING COSMIC HIERARCHY
OR LIKE A HIGH-BRED MAIDEN WITH CHASTE EYES
FORBIDDEN TO WALK UNVEILED THE PUBLIC WAYS
SHE MUST IN CLOSE SECLUDED CHAMBERS MOVE
HER FEELING IN CLOISTERS LIVE OR GARDENED PATHS
LIFE WAS CONSIGNED TO A SAFE LEVEL PATH
IT DARED NOT TEMPT THE GREAT AND DIFFICULT HEIGHTS
OR CLIMB TO BE NEIGHBOUR TO A LONELY STAR
OR SKIRT THE DANGER OF THE PRECIPICE
OR TEMPT THE FOAM-CURLED BREAKERS' PERILOUS LAUGH
ADVENTURE'S LYRIST DANGER'S AMATEUR
OR INTO HER CHAMBER CALL SOME FLAMING GOD
OR LEAVE THE WORLD'S BOUNDS AND WHERE NO LIMITS ARE
497
MEET WITH THE HEART'S PASSION THE ADORABLE
OR SET THE WORLD ABLAZE WITH THE INNER FIRE
A CHASTENED EPITHET IN THE PROSE OF LIFE
SHE MUST FILL WITH COLOUR JUST HER SANCTIONED SPACE
NOT BREAK OUT OF THE CABIN OF THE IDEA
NOR TRESPASS INTO RHYTHMS TOO HIGH OR VAST
EVEN WHEN IT SOARED INTO IDEAL AIR
THOUGHT'S FLIGHT LOST NOT ITSELF IN HEAVEN'S BLUE
IT DREW UPON THE SKIES A PATTERNED FLOWER
OF DISCIPLINED BEAUTY AND HARMONIC LIGHT
A TEMPERATE VIGILANT SPIRIT GOVERNED LIFE
ITS ACTS WERE TOOLS OF THE CONSIDERING THOUGHT
TOO COLD TO TAKE FIRE AND SET THE WORLD ABLAZE
OR THE CAREFUL REASON'S DIPLOMATIC MOVES
TESTING THE MEANS TO A PREFIGURED END
OR AT THE HIGHEST PITCH SOME CALM WILL'S PLAN
OR A STRATEGY OF SOME HIGH COMMAND WITHIN
TO CONQUER THE SECRET TREASURES OF THE GODS
OR WIN FOR A MASKED KING SOME GLORIOUS WORLD
NOT A REFLEX OF THE SPONTANEOUS SELF
AN INDEX OF THE BEING AND ITS MOODS
A WINGING OF CONSCIOUS SPIRIT A SACRAMENT
OF LIFE'S COMMUNION WITH THE STILL SUPREME
OR ITS PURE MOVEMENT ON THE ETERNAL'S ROAD
OR ELSE FOR THE BODY OF SOME HIGH IDEA
A HOUSE WAS BUILT WITH TOO CLOSE-FITTING BRICKS
ACTION AND THOUGHT CEMENTED MADE A WALL
OF SMALL IDEALS LIMITING THE SOUL
EVEN MEDITATION MUSED ON A NARROW SEAT
AND WORSHIP TURNED TO AN EXCLUSIVE GOD
TO THE UNIVERSAL IN A CHAPEL PRAYED
WHOSE DOORS WERE SHUT AGAINST THE UNIVERSE
OR KNEELED TO THE BODILESS IMPERSONAL
A MIND SHUT TO THE CRY AND FIRE OF LOVE
A RATIONAL RELIGION DRIED THE HEART
IT PLANNED A SMOOTH LIFE'S ACTS WITH ETHICS' RULE
498
OR OFFERED A COLD AND FLAMELESS SACRIFICE
THE SACRED BOOK LAY ON ITS SANCTIFIED DESK
WRAPPED IN INTERPRETATION'S SILKEN STRINGS
A CREDO SEALED UP ITS SPIRITUAL SENSE
HERE WAS A QUIET COUNTRY OF FIXED MIND
HERE LIFE NO MORE WAS ALL NOR PASSION'S VOICE
THE CRY OF SENSE HAD SUNK INTO A HUSH
SOUL WAS NOT THERE NOR SPIRIT BUT MIND ALONE
MIND CLAIMED TO BE THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL
THE SPIRIT SAW ITSELF AS FORM OF MIND
LOST ITSELF IN THE GLORY OF THE THOUGHT
A LIGHT THAT MADE INVISIBLE THE SUN
INTO A FIRM AND SETTLED SPACE SHE CAME
WHERE ALL WAS STILL AND ALL THINGS KEPT THEIR PLACE
EACH FOUND WHAT IT HAD SOUGHT AND KNEW ITS AIM
ALL HAD A FINAL LAST STABILITY
THERE ONE STOOD FORTH WHO BORE AUTHORITY
ON AN IMPORTANT BROW AND HELD A ROD
COMMAND WAS INCARNATE IN HIS GESTURE AND TONE
TRADITION'S PETRIFIED WISDOM CARVED HIS SPEECH
HIS SENTENCES SAVOURED THE ORACLE
TRAVELLER OR PILGRIM OF THE INNER WORLD
FORTUNATE ART THOU TO REACH OUR BRILLIANT AIR
FLAMING WITH THOUGHT'S SUPREME FINALITY
O ASPIRANT TO THE PERFECT WAY OF LIFE
HERE FIND IT REST FROM SEARCH AND LIVE AT PEACE
OURS IS THE HOME OF COSMIC CERTAINTY
HERE IS THE TRUTH GOD'S HARMONY IS HERE
REGISTER THY NAME IN THE BOOK OF THE ELITE
ADMITTED BY THE SANCTION OF THE FEW
ADOPT THY STATION OF KNOWLEDGE THY POST IN MIND
THY TICKET OF ORDER DRAW IN LIFE'S BUREAU
AND PRAISE THY FATE THAT MADE THEE ONE OF OURS
ALL HERE DOCKETED AND TIED THE MIND CAN KNOW
ALL SCHEMED BY LAW THAT GOD PERMITS TO LIFE
499
THIS IS THE END AND THERE IS NO BEYOND
HERE IS THE SAFETY OF THE ULTIMATE WALL
HERE IS THE CLARITY OF THE SWORD OF LIGHT
HERE IS THE VICTORY OF A SINGLE TRUTH
HERE BURNS THE DIAMOND OF FLAWLESS BLISS
A FAVOURITE OF HEAVEN AND NATURE LIVE
BUT TO THE TOO SATISFIED AND CONFIDENT SAGE
SAVITRI REPLIED CASTING INTO HIS WORLD
SIGHT'S DEEP RELEASE THE HEART'S QUESTIONING INNER VOICE
FOR HERE THE HEART SPOKE NOT ONLY CLEAR DAYLIGHT
OF INTELLECT REIGNED HERE LIMITING COLD PRECISE
HAPPY ARE THEY WHO IN THIS CHAOS OF THINGS
THIS COMING AND GOING OF THE FEET OF TIME
CAN FIND THE SINGLE TRUTH THE ETERNAL LAW
UNTOUCHED THEY LIVE BY HOPE AND DOUBT AND FEAR
HAPPY ARE MEN ANCHORED ON FIXED BELIEF
IN THIS UNCERTAIN AND AMBIGUOUS WORLD
OR WHO HAVE PLANTED IN THE HEART'S RICH SOIL
ONE SMALL GRAIN OF SPIRITUAL CERTITUDE
HAPPIEST WHO STAND ON FAITH AS ON A ROCK
BUT I MUST PASS LEAVING THE ENDED SEARCH
TRUTH'S ROUNDED OUTCOME FIRM IMMUTABLE
AND THIS HARMONIC BUILDING OF WORLD-FACT
THIS ORDERED KNOWLEDGE OF APPARENT THINGS
HERE I CAN STAY NOT FOR I SEEK MY SOUL
NONE ANSWERED IN THAT BRIGHT CONTENTED WORLD
OR ONLY TURNED ON THEIR ACCUSTOMED WAY
ASTONISHED TO HEAR QUESTIONING IN THAT AIR
OR THOUGHTS THAT COULD STILL TURN TO THE BEYOND
BUT SOME MURMURED PASSERS-BY FROM KINDRED SPHERES
EACH BY HIS CREDO JUDGED THE THOUGHT SHE SPOKE
WHO THEN IS THIS WHO KNOWS NOT THAT THE SOUL
IS A LEAST GLAND OR A SECRETION'S FAULT
DISQUIETING THE SANE GOVERNMENT OF THE MIND
DISORDERING THE FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN
OR A YEARNING LODGED IN NATURE'S MORTAL HOUSE
500
OR DREAM WHISPERED IN MAN'S CAVE OF HOLLOW THOUGHT
WHO WOULD PROLONG HIS BRIEF UNHAPPY TERM
OR CLING TO LIVING IN A SEA OF DEATH
BUT OTHERS NAY IT IS HER SPIRIT SHE SEEKS
A SPLENDID SHADOW OF THE NAME OF GOD
A FORMLESS LUSTRE FROM THE IDEAL'S REALM
THE SPIRIT IS THE HOLY GHOST OF MIND
BUT NONE HAS TOUCHED ITS LIMBS OR SEEN ITS FACE
EACH SOUL IS THE GREAT FATHER'S CRUCIFIED SON
MIND IS THAT SOUL'S ONE PARENT ITS CONSCIOUS CAUSE
THE GROUND ON WHICH TREMBLES A BRIEF PASSING LIGHT
MIND SOLE CREATOR OF THE APPARENT WORLD
ALL THAT IS HERE IS PART OF OUR OWN SELF
OUR MINDS HAVE MADE THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE
ANOTHER WITH MYSTIC AND UNSATISFIED EYES
WHO LOVED HIS SLAIN BELIEF AND MOURNED ITS DEATH
IS THERE ONE LEFT WHO SEEKS FOR A BEYOND
CAN STILL THE PATH BE FOUND OPENED THE GATE
SO SHE FARED ON ACROSS HER SILENT SELF
TO A ROAD SHE CAME THRONGED WITH AN ARDENT CROWD
WHO SPED BRILLIANT FIRE-FOOTED SUNLIGHT-EYED
PRESSING TO REACH THE WORLD'S MYSTERIOUS WALL
AND PASS THROUGH MASKED DOORWAYS INTO OUTER MIND
WHERE THE LIGHT COMES NOT NOR THE MYSTIC VOICE
MESSENGERS FROM OUR SUBLIMINAL GREATNESSES
GUESTS FROM THE CAVERN OF THE SECRET SOUL
INTO DIM SPIRITUAL SOMNOLENCE THEY BREAK
OR SHED WIDE WONDER ON OUR WAKING SELF
IDEAS THAT HAUNT US WITH THEIR RADIANT TREAD
DREAMS THAT ARE HINTS OF UNBORN REALITY
STRANGE GODDESSES WITH DEEP-POOLED MAGICAL EYES
STRONG WIND-HAIRED GODS CARRYING THE HARPS OF HOPE
GREAT MOON-HUED VISIONS GLIDING THROUGH GOLD AIR
ASPIRATION'S SUN-DREAM HEAD AND STAR-CARVED LIMBS
EMOTIONS MAKING COMMON HEARTS SUBLIME
501
AND SAVITRI MINGLING IN THAT GLORIOUS CROWD
YEARNING TO THE SPIRITUAL LIGHT THEY BORE
LONGED ONCE TO HASTEN LIKE THEM TO SAVE GOD'S WORLD
BUT SHE REINED BACK THE HIGH PASSION IN HER HEART
SHE KNEW THAT FIRST SHE MUST DISCOVER HER SOUL
ONLY WHO SAVE THEMSELVES CAN OTHERS SAVE
IN CONTRARY SENSE SHE FACED LIFE'S RIDDLING TRUTH
THEY CARRYING THE LIGHT TO SUFFERING MEN
HURRIED WITH EAGER FEET TO THE OUTER WORLD
HER EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE ETERNAL SOURCE
OUTSTRETCHING HER HANDS TO STAY THE THRONG SHE CRIED
O HAPPY COMPANY OF LUMINOUS GODS
REVEAL WHO KNOW THE ROAD THAT I MUST TREAD
FOR SURELY THAT BRIGHT QUARTER IS YOUR HOME
TO FIND THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE OCCULT FIRE
AND THE DEEP MANSION OF MY SECRET SOUL
ONE ANSWERED POINTING TO A SILENCE DIM
ON A REMOTE EXTREMITY OF SLEEP
IN SOME FAR BACKGROUND OF THE INNER WORLD
O SAVITRI FROM THY HIDDEN SOUL WE COME
WE ARE THE MESSENGERS THE OCCULT GODS
WHO HELP MEN'S DRAB AND HEAVY IGNORANT LIVES
TO WAKE TO BEAUTY AND THE WONDER OF THINGS
TOUCHING THEM WITH GLORY AND DIVINITY
IN EVIL WE LIGHT THE DEATHLESS FLAME OF GOOD
AND HOLD THE TORCH OF KNOWLEDGE ON IGNORANT ROADS
WE ARE THY WILL AND ALL MEN'S WILL TOWARDS LIGHT
O HUMAN COPY AND DISGUISE OF GOD
WHO SEEKST THE DEITY THOU KEEPEST HID
AND LIVEST BY THE TRUTH THOU HAST NOT KNOWN
FOLLOW THE WORLD'S WINDING HIGHWAY TO ITS SOURCE
THERE IN THE SILENCE FEW HAVE EVER REACHED
THOU SHALT SEE THE FIRE BURNING ON THE BARE STONE
AND THE DEEP CAVERN OF THY SECRET SOUL
THEN SAVITRI FOLLOWING THE GREAT WINDING ROAD
CAME WHERE IT DWINDLED INTO A NARROW PATH
502
TROD ONLY BY RARE WOUNDED PILGRIM FEET
A FEW BRIGHT FORMS EMERGED FROM UNKNOWN DEPTHS
AND LOOKED AT HER WITH CALM IMMORTAL EYES
THERE WAS NO SOUND TO BREAK THE BROODING HUSH
ONE FELT THE SILENT NEARNESS OF THE SOUL
503
HERE FROM A LOW AND PRONE AND LISTLESS GROUND
THE PASSION OF THE FIRST ASCENT BEGAN
A MOON-BRIGHT FACE IN A SOMBRE CLOUD OF HAIR
A WOMAN SAT IN A PALE LUSTROUS ROBE
A RUGGED AND RAGGED SOIL WAS HER BARE SEAT
BENEATH HER FEET A SHARP AND WOUNDING STONE
A DIVINE PITY ON THE PEAKS OF THE WORLD
A SPIRIT TOUCHED BY THE GRIEF OF ALL THAT LIVES
SHE LOOKED OUT FAR AND SAW FROM INNER MIND
THIS QUESTIONABLE WORLD OF OUTWARD THINGS
OF FALSE APPEARANCES AND PLAUSIBLE SHAPES
THIS DUBIOUS COSMOS STRETCHED IN THE IGNORANT VOID
THE PANGS OF EARTH THE TOIL AND SPEED OF THE STARS
AND THE DIFFICULT BIRTH AND DOLOROUS END OF LIFE
ACCEPTING THE UNIVERSE AS HER BODY OF WOE
THE MOTHER OF THE SEVEN SORROWS BORE
THE SEVEN STABS THAT PIERCED HER BLEEDING HEART
THE BEAUTY OF SADNESS LINGERED ON HER FACE
HER EYES WERE DIM WITH THE ANCIENT STAIN OF TEARS
HER HEART WAS RIVEN WITH THE WORLD'S AGONY
AND BURDENED WITH THE SORROW AND STRUGGLE IN TIME
AN ANGUISHED MUSIC TRAILED IN HER RAPT VOICE
ABSORBED IN A DEEP COMPASSION'S ECSTASY
LIFTING THE MILD RAY OF HER PATIENT GAZE
IN SOFT SWEET TRAINING WORDS SLOWLY SHE SPOKE
O SAVITRI I AM THY SECRET SOUL
TO SHARE THE SUFFERING OF THE WORLD I CAME
I DRAW MY CHILDREN'S PANGS INTO MY BREAST
I AM THE NURSE OF THE DOLOUR BENEATH THE STARS
I AM THE SOUL OF ALL WHO WAILING WRITHE
UNDER THE RUTHLESS HARROW OF THE GODS
504
I AM WOMAN NURSE AND SLAVE AND BEATEN BEAST
I TEND THE HANDS THAT GAVE ME CRUEL BLOWS
THE HEARTS THAT SPURNED MY LOVE AND ZEAL I SERVE
I AM THE COURTED QUEEN THE PAMPERED DOLL
I AM THE GIVER OF THE BOWL OF RICE
I AM THE WORSHIPPED ANGEL OF THE HOUSE
I AM IN ALL THAT SUFFERS AND THAT CRIES
MINE IS THE PRAYER THAT CLIMBS IN VAIN FROM EARTH
I AM TRAVERSED BY MY CREATURES' AGONIES
I AM THE SPIRIT IN A WORLD OF PAIN
THE SCREAM OF TORTURED FLESH AND TORTURED HEARTS
FALL'N BACK ON HEART AND FLESH UNHEARD BY HEAVEN
HAS RENT WITH HELPLESS GRIEF AND WRATH MY SOUL
I HAVE SEEN THE PEASANT BURNING IN HIS HUT
I HAVE SEEN THE SLASHED CORPSE OF THE SLAUGHTERED CHILD
HEARD WOMAN'S CRY RAVISHED AND STRIPPED AND HALED
AMID THE BAYINGS OF THE HELL-HOUND MOB
I HAVE LOOKED ON I HAD NO POWER TO SAVE
I HAVE BROUGHT NO ARM OF STRENGTH TO AID OR SLAY
GOD GAVE ME LOVE HE GAVE ME NOT HIS FORCE
I HAVE SHARED THE TOIL OF THE YOKED ANIMAL DRUDGE
PUSHED BY THE GOAD ENCOURAGED BY THE WHIP
I HAVE SHARED THE FEAR-FILLED LIFE OF BIRD AND BEAST
ITS LONG HUNT FOR THE DAY'S PRECARIOUS FOOD
ITS COVERT SLINK AND CROUCH AND HUNGRY PROWL
ITS PAIN AND TERROR SEIZED BY BEAK AND CLAW
I HAVE SHARED THE DAILY LIFE OF COMMON MEN
ITS PETTY PLEASURES AND ITS PETTY CARES
ITS PRESS OF TROUBLES AND HAGGARD HORDE OF ILLS
EARTH'S TRAIL OF SORROW HOPELESS OF RELIEF
THE UNWANTED TEDIOUS LABOUR WITHOUT JOY
AND THE BURDEN OF MISERY AND THE STROKES OF FATE
I HAVE BEEN PITY LEANING OVER PAIN
AND THE TENDER SMILE THAT HEALS THE WOUNDED HEART
AND SYMPATHY MAKING LIFE LESS HARD TO BEAR
MAN HAS FELT NEAR MY UNSEEN FACE AND HANDS
505
I HAVE BECOME THE SUFFERER AND HIS MOAN
I HAVE LAIN DOWN WITH THE MANGLED AND THE SLAIN
I HAVE LIVED WITH THE PRISONER IN HIS DUNGEON CELL
HEAVY ON MY SHOULDERS WEIGHS THE YOKE OF TIME
NOTHING REFUSING OF CREATION'S LOAD
I HAVE BORNE ALL AND KNOW I STILL MUST BEAR
PERHAPS WHEN THE WORLD SINKS INTO A LAST SLEEP
I TOO MAY SLEEP IN DUMB ETERNAL PEACE
I HAVE BORNE THE CALM INDIFFERENCE OF HEAVEN
WATCHED NATURE'S CRUELTY TO SUFFERING THINGS
WHILE GOD PASSED SILENT BY NOR TURNED TO HELP
YET HAVE I CRIED NOT OUT AGAINST HIS WILL
YET HAVE I NOT ACCUSED HIS COSMIC LAW
ONLY TO CHANGE THIS GREAT HARD WORLD OF PAIN
A PATIENT PRAYER HAS RISEN FROM MY BREAST
A PALLID RESIGNATION LIGHTS MY BROW
WITHIN ME A BLIND FAITH AND MERCY DWELL
I CARRY THE FIRE THAT NEVER CAN BE QUENCHED
AND THE COMPASSION THAT SUPPORTS THE SUNS
I AM THE HOPE THAT LOOKS TOWARDS MY GOD
MY GOD WHO NEVER CAME TO ME TILL NOW
HIS VOICE I HEAR THAT EVER SAYS 'I COME'
I KNOW THAT ONE DAY HE SHALL COME AT LAST
SHE CEASED AND LIKE AN ECHO FROM BELOW
ANSWERING HER PATHOS OF DIVINE COMPLAINT
A VOICE OF WRATH TOOK UP THE DIRE REFRAIN
A GROWL OF THUNDER OR ROAR OF ANGRY BEAST
THE BEAST THAT CROUCHING GROWLS WITHIN MAN'S DEPTHS
VOICE OF A TORTURED TITAN ONCE A GOD
I AM THE MAN OF SORROWS I AM HE
WHO IS NAILED ON THE WIDE CROSS OF THE UNIVERSE
TO ENJOY MY AGONY GOD BUILT THE EARTH
MY PASSION HE HAS MADE HIS DRAMA'S THEME
HE HAS SENT ME NAKED INTO HIS BITTER WORLD
AND BEATEN ME WITH HIS RODS OF GRIEF AND PAIN
THAT I MIGHT CRY AND GROVEL AT HIS FEET
506
AND OFFER HIM WORSHIP WITH MY BLOOD AND TEARS
I AM PROMETHEUS UNDER THE VULTURE'S BEAK
MAN THE DISCOVERER OF THE UNDYING FIRE
IN THE FLAME HE KINDLED BURNING LIKE A MOTH
I AM THE SEEKER WHO CAN NEVER FIND
I AM THE FIGHTER WHO CAN NEVER WIN
I AM THE RUNNER WHO NEVER TOUCHED HIS GOAL
HELL TORTURES ME WITH THE EDGES OF MY THOUGHT
HEAVEN TORTURES ME WITH THE SPLENDOUR OF MY DREAMS
WHAT PROFIT HAVE I OF MY ANIMAL BIRTH
WHAT PROFIT HAVE I OF MY HUMAN SOUL
I TOIL LIKE THE ANIMAL LIKE THE ANIMAL DIE
I AM MAN THE REBEL MAN THE HELPLESS SERF
FATE AND MY FELLOWS CHEAT ME OF MY WAGE
I LOOSEN WITH MY BLOOD MY SERVITUDE'S SEAL
AND SHAKE FROM MY ACHING NECK THE OPPRESSOR'S KNEES
ONLY TO SEAT NEW TYRANTS ON MY BACK
MY TEACHERS LESSON ME IN SLAVERY
I AM SHOWN GOD'S STAMP AND MY OWN SIGNATURE
UPON THE SORRY CONTRACT OF MY FATE
I HAVE LOVED BUT NONE HAS LOVED ME SINCE MY BIRTH
MY FRUIT OF WORKS IS GIVEN TO OTHER HANDS
ALL THAT IS LEFT ME IS MY EVIL THOUGHTS
MY SORDID QUARREL AGAINST GOD AND MAN
ENVY OF THE RICHES THAT I CANNOT SHARE
HATE OF A HAPPINESS THAT IS NOT MINE
I KNOW MY FATE WILL EVER BE THE SAME
IT IS MY NATURE'S WORK THAT CANNOT CHANGE
I HAVE LOVED FOR MINE NOT FOR THE BELOVED'S SAKE
I HAVE LIVED FOR MYSELF AND NOT FOR OTHERS' LIVES
EACH IN HIMSELF IS SOLE BY NATURE'S LAW
SO GOD HAS MADE HIS HARSH AND DREADFUL WORLD
SO HAS HE BUILT THE PETTY HEART OF MAN
ONLY BY FORCE AND RUSE CAN MAN SURVIVE
FOR PITY IS A WEAKNESS IN HIS BREAST
HIS GOODNESS IS A LAXITY IN THE NERVES
507
HIS KINDNESS AN INVESTMENT FOR RETURN
HIS ALTRUISM IS EGO'S OTHER FACE
HE SERVES THE WORLD THAT HIM THE WORLD MAY SERVE
IF ONCE THE TITAN'S STRENGTH COULD WAKE IN ME
IF ENCELADUS FROM ETNA COULD ARISE
I THEN WOULD REIGN THE MASTER OF THE WORLD
AND LIKE A GOD ENJOY MAN'S BLISS AND PAIN
BUT GOD HAS TAKEN FROM ME THE ANCIENT FORCE
THERE IS A DULL CONSENT IN MY SLUGGISH HEART
A FIERCE SATISFACTION WITH MY SPECIAL PANGS
AS IF THEY MADE ME TALLER THAN MY KIND
ONLY BY SUFFERING CAN I EXCEL
I AM THE VICTIM OF TITANIC ILLS
I AM THE DOER OF DEMONIAC DEEDS
I WAS MADE FOR EVIL EVIL IS MY LOT
EVIL I MUST BE AND BY EVIL LIVE
NOUGHT OTHER CAN I DO BUT BE MYSELF
WHAT NATURE MADE ME THAT I MUST REMAIN
I SUFFER AND TOIL AND WEEP I MOAN AND HATE
AND SAVITRI HEARD THE VOICE THE ECHO HEARD
AND TURNING TO HER BEING OF PITY SPOKE
MADONNA OF SUFFERING MOTHER OF GRIEF DIVINE
THOU ART A PORTION OF MY SOUL PUT FORTH
TO BEAR THE UNBEARABLE SORROW OF THE WORLD
BECAUSE THOU ART MEN YIELD NOT TO THEIR DOOM
BUT ASK FOR HAPPINESS AND STRIVE WITH FATE
BECAUSE THOU ART THE WRETCHED STILL CAN HOPE
BUT THINE IS THE POWER TO SOLACE NOT TO SAVE
ONE DAY I WILL RETURN A BRINGER OF STRENGTH
AND MAKE THEE DRINK FROM THE ETERNAL'S CUP
HIS STREAMS OF FORCE SHALL TRIUMPH IN THY LIMBS
AND WISDOM'S CALM CONTROL THY PASSIONATE HEART
THY LOVE SHALL BE THE BOND OF HUMANKIND
COMPASSION THE BRIGHT KEY OF NATURE'S ACTS
MISERY SHALL PASS ABOLISHED FROM THE EARTH
THE WORLD SHALL BE FREED FROM THE ANGER OF THE BEAST
508
FROM THE CRUELTY OF THE TITAN AND HIS PAIN
THERE SHALL BE PEACE AND JOY FOR EVER MORE
ON PASSED SHE IN HER SPIRIT'S UPWARD ROUTE
AN ARDENT GRANDEUR CLIMBED MID FERNS AND ROCKS
A QUIET WIND FLATTERED THE HEART TO WARMTH
A FINER PERFUME BREATHED FROM SLENDER TREES
ALL BEAUTIFUL GREW SUBTLE AND HIGH AND STRANGE
HERE ON A BOULDER CARVED LIKE A HUGE THRONE
A WOMAN SAT IN GOLD AND PURPLE SHEEN
ARMED WITH THE TRIDENT AND THE THUNDERBOLT
HER FEET UPON A COUCHANT LION'S BACK
A FORMIDABLE SMILE CURVED ROUND HER LIPS
HEAVEN-FIRE LAUGHED IN THE CORNERS OF HER EYES
HER BODY A MASS OF COURAGE AND HEAVENLY STRENGTH
SHE MENACED THE TRIUMPH OF THE NETHER GODS
A HALO OF LIGHTNINGS FLAMED AROUND HER HEAD
AND SOVEREIGNTY A GREAT CESTUS ZONED HER ROBE
AND MAJESTY AND VICTORY SAT WITH HER
GUARDING IN THE WIDE COSMIC BATTLEFIELD
AGAINST THE FLAT EQUALITY OF DEATH
AND THE ALL-LEVELLING INSURGENT NIGHT
THE HIERARCHY OF THE ORDERED POWERS
THE HIGH CHANGELESS VALUES THE PEAKED EMINENCES
THE PRIVILEGED ARISTOCRACY OF TRUTH
AND IN THE GOVERNING IDEAL'S SUN
THE TRIUMVIRATE OF WISDOM LOVE AND BLISS
AND THE SOLE AUTOCRACY OF THE ABSOLUTE LIGHT
AUGUST ON HER SEAT IN THE INNER WORLD OF MIND
THE MOTHER OF MIGHT LOOKED DOWN ON PASSING THINGS
LISTENED TO THE ADVANCING TREAD OF TIME
SAW THE IRRESISTIBLE WHEELING OF THE SUNS
AND HEARD THE THUNDER OF THE MARCH OF GOD
AMID THE SWAYING FORCES IN THEIR STRIFE
SOVEREIGN WAS HER WORD OF LUMINOUS COMMAND
HER SPEECH LIKE A WAR-CRY RANG OR A PILGRIM CHANT
509
A CHARM RESTORING HOPE IN FAILING HEARTS
ASPIRED THE HARMONY OF HER PUISSANT VOICE
O SAVITRI I AM THY SECRET SOUL
I HAVE COME DOWN INTO THE HUMAN WORLD
AND THE MOVEMENT WATCHED BY AN UNSLEEPING EYE
AND THE DARK CONTRARIETY OF EARTH'S FATE
AND THE BATTLE OF THE BRIGHT AND SOMBRE POWERS
I STAND UPON EARTH'S PATHS OF DANGER AND GRIEF
AND HELP THE UNFORTUNATE AND SAVE THE DOOMED
TO THE STRONG I BRING THE GUERDON OF THEIR STRENGTH
TO THE WEAK I BRING THE ARMOUR OF MY FORCE
TO MEN WHO LONG I CARRY THEIR COVETED JOY
I AM FORTUNE JUSTIFYING THE GREAT AND WISE
BY THE SANCTION OF THE PLAUDITS OF THE CROWD
THEN TRAMPLING THEM WITH THE ARMED HEEL OF FATE
MY EAR IS LEANED TO THE CRY OF THE OPPRESSED
I TOPPLE DOWN THE THRONES OF TYRANT KINGS
A CRY COMES FROM PROSCRIBED AND HUNTED LIVES
APPEALING TO ME AGAINST A PITILESS WORLD
A VOICE OF THE FORSAKEN AND DESOLATE
AND THE LONE PRISONER IN HIS DUNGEON CELL
MEN HAIL IN MY COMING THE ALMIGHTY'S FORCE
OR PRAISE WITH THANKFUL TEARS HIS SAVIOUR GRACE
I SMITE THE TITAN WHO BESTRIDES THE WORLD
AND SLAY THE OGRE IN HIS BLOOD-STAINED DEN
I AM DURGA GODDESS OF THE PROUD AND STRONG
AND LAKSHMI QUEEN OF THE FAIR AND FORTUNATE
I WEAR THE FACE OF KALI WHEN I KILL
I TRAMPLE THE CORPSES OF THE DEMON HORDES
I AM CHARGED BY GOD TO DO HIS MIGHTY WORK
UNCARING I SERVE HIS WILL WHO SENT ME FORTH
RECKLESS OF PERIL AND EARTHLY CONSEQUENCE
I REASON NOT OF VIRTUE AND OF SIN
BUT DO THE DEED HE HAS PUT INTO MY HEART
I FEAR NOT FOR THE ANGRY FROWN OF HEAVEN
I FLINCH NOT FROM THE RED ASSAULT OF HELL
510
I CRUSH THE OPPOSITION OF THE GODS
TREAD DOWN A MILLION GOBLIN OBSTACLES
I GUIDE MAN TO THE PATH OF THE DIVINE
AND GUARD HIM FROM THE RED WOLF AND THE SNAKE
I SET IN HIS MORTAL HAND MY HEAVENLY SWORD
AND PUT ON HIM THE BREASTPLATE OF THE GODS
I BREAK THE IGNORANT PRIDE OF HUMAN MIND
AND LEAD THE THOUGHT TO THE WIDENESS OF THE TRUTH
I REND MAN'S NARROW AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE
AND FORCE HIS SORROWFUL EYES TO GAZE AT THE SUN
THAT HE MAY DIE TO EARTH AND LIVE IN HIS SOUL
I KNOW THE GOAL I KNOW THE SECRET ROUTE
I HAVE STUDIED THE MAP OF THE INVISIBLE WORLDS
I AM THE BATTLE'S HEAD THE JOURNEY'S STAR
BUT THE GREAT OBSTINATE WORLD RESISTS MY WORD
AND THE CROOKEDNESS AND EVIL IN MAN'S HEART
IS STRONGER THAN REASON PROFOUNDER THAN THE PIT
AND THE MALIGNANCY OF HOSTILE POWERS
PUTS CRAFTILY BACK THE CLOCK OF DESTINY
AND MIGHTIER SEEMS THAN THE ETERNAL WILL
THE COSMIC EVIL IS TOO DEEP TO UNROOT
THE COSMIC SUFFERING IS TOO VAST TO HEAL
A FEW I GUIDE WHO PASS ME TOWARDS THE LIGHT
A FEW I SAVE THE MASS FALLS BACK UNSAVED
A FEW I HELP THE MANY STRIVE AND FAIL
BUT MY HEART I HAVE HARDENED AND I DO MY WORK
SLOWLY THE LIGHT GROWS GREATER IN THE EAST
SLOWLY THE WORLD PROGRESSES ON GOD'S ROAD
HIS SEAL IS ON MY TASK IT CANNOT FAIL
I SHALL HEAR THE SILVER SWING OF HEAVEN'S GATES
WHEN GOD COMES OUT TO MEET THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
SHE SPOKE AND FROM THE LOWER HUMAN WORLD
AN ANSWER A WARPED ECHO MET HER SPEECH
THE VOICE CAME THROUGH THE SPACES OF THE MIND
OF THE DWARF-TITAN THE DEFORMED CHAINED GOD
WHO STRIVES TO MASTER HIS NATURE'S REBEL STUFF
511
AND MAKE THE UNIVERSE HIS INSTRUMENT
THE EGO OF THIS GREAT WORLD OF DESIRE
CLAIMED EARTH AND THE WIDE HEAVENS FOR THE USE
OF MAN HEAD OF THE LIFE IT SHAPES ON EARTH
ITS REPRESENTATIVE AND CONSCIOUS SOUL
AND SYMBOL OF EVOLVING LIGHT AND FORCE
AND VESSEL OF THE GODHEAD THAT MUST BE
A THINKING ANIMAL NATURE'S STRUGGLING LORD
HAS MADE OF HER HIS NURSE AND TOOL AND SLAVE
AND PAYS TO HER AS WAGE AND EMOLUMENT
INESCAPABLY BY A DEEP LAW IN THINGS
HIS HEART'S GRIEF AND HIS BODY'S DEATH AND PAIN
HIS PAINS ARE HER MEANS TO GROW TO SEE AND FEEL
HIS DEATH ASSISTS HER IMMORTALITY
A TOOL AND SLAVE OF HIS OWN SLAVE AND TOOL
HE PRAISES HIS FREE WILL AND HIS MASTER MIND
AND IS PUSHED BY HER UPON HER CHOSEN PATHS
POSSESSOR HE IS POSSESSED AND RULER RULED
HER CONSCIOUS AUTOMATON HER DESIRE'S DUPE
HIS SOUL IS HER GUEST A SOVEREIGN MUTE INERT
HIS BODY HER ROBOT HIS LIFE HER WAY TO LIVE
HIS CONSCIOUS MIND HER STRONG REVOLTED SERF
THE VOICE ROSE UP AND SMOTE SOME INNER SUN
I AM THE HEIR OF THE FORCES OF THE EARTH
SLOWLY I MAKE GOOD MY RIGHT TO MY ESTATE
A GROWING GODHEAD IN HER DIVINISED MUD
I CLIMB A CLAIMANT TO THE THRONE OF HEAVEN
THE LAST-BORN OF THE EARTH I STAND THE FIRST
HER SLOW MILLENNIUMS WAITED FOR MY BIRTH
ALTHOUGH I LIVE IN TIME BESIEGED BY DEATH
PRECARIOUS OWNER OF MY BODY AND SOUL
HOUSED ON A LITTLE SPECK AMID THE STARS
FOR ME AND MY USE THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE
IMMORTAL SPIRIT IN THE PERISHING CLAY
I AM GOD STILL UNEVOLVED IN HUMAN FORM
EVEN IF HE IS NOT HE BECOMES IN ME
512
THE SUN AND MOON ARE LIGHTS UPON MY PATH
AIR WAS INVENTED FOR MY LUNGS TO BREATHE
CONDITIONED AS A WIDE AND WALL-LESS SPACE
FOR MY WINGED CHARIOT'S WHEELS TO CLEAVE A ROAD
THE SEA WAS MADE FOR ME TO SWIM AND SAIL
AND BEAR MY GOLDEN COMMERCE ON ITS BACK
IT LAUGHS CLOVEN BY MY PLEASURE'S GLIDING KEEL
I LAUGH AT ITS BLACK STARE OF FATE AND DEATH
THE EARTH IS MY FLOOR THE SKY MY LIVING'S ROOF
ALL WAS PREPARED THROUGH MANY A SILENT AGE
GOD MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH ANIMAL SHAPES
THEN ONLY WHEN ALL WAS READY I WAS BORN
I WAS BORN WEAK AND SMALL AND IGNORANT
A HELPLESS CREATURE IN A DIFFICULT WORLD
TRAVELLING THROUGH MY BRIEF YEARS WITH DEATH AT MY SIDE
I HAVE GROWN GREATER THAN NATURE WISER THAN GOD
I HAVE MADE REAL WHAT SHE NEVER DREAMED
I HAVE SEIZED HER POWERS AND HARNESSED FOR MY WORK
I HAVE SHAPED HER METALS AND NEW METALS MADE
I WILL MAKE GLASS AND RAIMENT OUT OF MILK
MAKE IRON VELVET WATER UNBREAKABLE STONE
LIKE GOD IN HIS ASTUCE OF ARTIST SKILL
MOULD FROM ONE PRIMAL PLASM PROTEAN FORMS
IN SINGLE NATURE MULTITUDINOUS LIVES
ALL THAT IMAGINATION CAN CONCEIVE
IN MIND INTANGIBLE REMOULD ANEW
IN MATTER'S PLASTIC SOLID AND CONCRETE
NO MAGIC CAN SURPASS MY MAGIC'S SKILL
THERE IS NO MIRACLE I SHALL NOT ACHIEVE
WHAT GOD IMPERFECT LEFT I WILL COMPLETE
OUT OF A TANGLED MIND AND HALF-MADE SOUL
HIS SIN AND ERROR I WILL ELIMINATE
WHAT HE INVENTED NOT I SHALL INVENT
HE WAS THE FIRST CREATOR I AM THE LAST
I HAVE FOUND THE ATOMS FROM WHICH HE BUILT THE WORLDS
THE FIRST TREMENDOUS COSMIC ENERGY
513
MISSIONED SHALL LEAP TO SLAY MY ENEMY KIN
EXPUNGE A NATION OR ABOLISH A RACE
DEATH'S SILENCE LEAVE WHERE THERE WAS LAUGHTER AND JOY
OR THE FISSURED INVISIBLE SHALL SPEND GOD'S FORCE
TO EXTEND MY COMFORTS AND EXPAND MY WEALTH
TO SPEED MY CAR WHICH NOW THE LIGHTNINGS DRIVE
AND TURN THE ENGINES OF MY MIRACLES
I WILL TAKE HIS MEANS OF SORCERY FROM HIS HANDS
AND DO WITH THEM GREATER WONDERS THAN HIS BEST
YET THROUGH IT ALL I HAVE KEPT MY BALANCED THOUGHT
I HAVE STUDIED MY BEING I HAVE EXAMINED THE WORLD
I HAVE GROWN A MASTER OF THE ARTS OF LIFE
I HAVE TAMED THE WILD BEAST TRAINED TO BE MY FRIEND
HE GUARDS MY HOUSE LOOKS UP WAITING MY WILL
I HAVE TAUGHT MY KIND TO SERVE AND TO OBEY
I HAVE USED THE MYSTERY OF THE COSMIC WAVES
TO SEE FAR DISTANCE AND TO HEAR FAR WORDS
I HAVE CONQUERED SPACE AND KNITTED CLOSE ALL EARTH
SOON I SHALL KNOW THE SECRETS OF THE MIND
I PLAY WITH KNOWLEDGE AND WITH IGNORANCE
AND SIN AND VIRTUE MY INVENTIONS ARE
I CAN TRANSCEND OR SOVEREIGNLY USE
I SHALL KNOW MYSTIC TRUTHS SEIZE OCCULT POWERS
I SHALL SLAY MY ENEMIES WITH A LOOK OR THOUGHT
I SHALL SENSE THE UNSPOKEN FEELINGS OF ALL HEARTS
AND SEE AND HEAR THE HIDDEN THOUGHTS OF MEN
WHEN EARTH IS MASTERED I SHALL CONQUER HEAVEN
THE GODS SHALL BE MY AIDES OR MENIAL FOLK
NO WISH I HARBOUR UNFULFILLED SHALL DIE
OMNIPOTENCE AND OMNISCIENCE SHALL BE MINE
AND SAVITRI HEARD THE VOICE THE WARPED ECHO HEARD
AND TURNING TO HER BEING OF POWER SHE SPOKE
MADONNA OF MIGHT MOTHER OF WORKS AND FORCE
THOU ART A PORTION OF MY SOUL PUT FORTH
TO HELP MANKIND AND HELP THE TRAVAIL OF TIME
BECAUSE THOU ART IN HIM MAN HOPES AND DARES
514
BECAUSE THOU ART MEN'S SOULS CAN CLIMB THE HEAVENS
AND WALK LIKE GODS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SUPREME
BUT WITHOUT WISDOM POWER IS LIKE A WIND
IT CAN BREATHE UPON THE HEIGHTS AND KISS THE SKY
IT CANNOT BUILD THE EXTREME ETERNAL THINGS
THOU HAST GIVEN MEN STRENGTH WISDOM THOU COULDST NOT GIVE
ONE DAY I WILL RETURN A BRINGER OF LIGHT
THEN WILL I GIVE TO THEE THE MIRROR OF GOD
THOU SHALT SEE SELF AND WORLD AS BY HIM THEY ARE SEEN
REFLECTED IN THE BRIGHT POOL OF THY SOUL
THY WISDOM SHALL BE VAST AS VAST THY POWER
THEN HATE SHALL DWELL NO MORE IN HUMAN HEARTS
AND FEAR AND WEAKNESS SHALL DESERT MEN'S LIVES
THE CRY OF THE EGO SHALL BE HUSHED WITHIN
ITS LION ROAR THAT CLAIMS THE WORLD AS FOOD
ALL SHALL BE MIGHT AND BLISS AND HAPPY FORCE
ASCENDING STILL HER SPIRIT'S UPWARD ROUTE
SHE CAME INTO A HIGH AND HAPPY SPACE
A WIDE TOWER OF VISION WHENCE ALL COULD BE SEEN
AND ALL WAS CENTRED IN A SINGLE VIEW
AS WHEN BY DISTANCE SEPARATE SCENES GROW ONE
AND A HARMONY IS MADE OF HUES AT WAR
THE WIND WAS STILL AND FRAGRANCE PACKED THE AIR
THERE WAS A CAROL OF BIRDS AND MURMUR OF BEES
AND ALL THAT IS COMMON AND NATURAL AND SWEET
YET INTIMATELY DIVINE TO HEART AND SOUL
A NEARNESS THRILLED OF THE SPIRIT TO ITS SOURCE
AND DEEPEST THINGS SEEMED OBVIOUS CLOSE AND TRUE
HERE LIVING CENTRE OF THAT VISION OF PEACE
A WOMAN SAT IN CLEAR AND CRYSTAL LIGHT
HEAVEN HAD UNVEILED ITS LUSTRE IN HER EYES
HER FEET WERE MOONBEAMS HER FACE WAS A BRIGHT SUN
HER SMILE COULD PERSUADE A DEAD LACERATED HEART
TO LIVE AGAIN AND FEEL THE HANDS OF CALM
A LOW MUSIC HEARD BECAME HER FLOATING VOICE
515
O SAVITRI I AM THY SECRET SOUL
I HAVE COME DOWN TO THE WOUNDED DESOLATE EARTH
TO HEAL HER PANGS AND LULL HER HEART TO REST
AND LAY HER HEAD UPON THE MOTHER'S LAP
THAT SHE MAY DREAM OF GOD AND KNOW HIS PEACE
AND DRAW THE HARMONY OF HIGHER SPHERES
INTO THE RHYTHM OF EARTH'S RUDE TROUBLED DAYS
I SHOW TO HER THE FIGURES OF BRIGHT GODS
AND BRING STRENGTH AND SOLACE TO HER STRUGGLING LIFE
HIGH THINGS THAT NOW ARE ONLY WORDS AND FORMS
I REVEAL TO HER IN THE BODY OF THEIR POWER
I AM PEACE THAT STEALS INTO MAN'S WAR-WORN BREAST
AMID THE REIGN OF HELL HIS ACTS CREATE
A HOSTEL WHERE HEAVEN'S MESSENGERS CAN LODGE
I AM CHARITY WITH THE KINDLY HANDS THAT BLESS
I AM SILENCE MID THE NOISY TRAMP OF LIFE
I AM KNOWLEDGE PORING ON HER COSMIC MAP
IN THE ANOMALIES OF THE HUMAN HEART
WHERE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CLOSE BEDFELLOWS
AND LIGHT IS BY DARKNESS DOGGED AT EVERY STEP
WHERE HIS LARGEST KNOWLEDGE IS AN IGNORANCE
I AM THE POWER THAT LABOURS TOWARDS THE BEST
AND WORKS FOR GOD AND LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS
I MAKE EVEN SIN AND ERROR STEPPING-STONES
AND ALL EXPERIENCE A LONG MARCH TOWARDS LIGHT
OUT OF THE INCONSCIENT I BUILD CONSCIOUSNESS
AND LEAD THROUGH DEATH TO REACH IMMORTAL LIFE
MANY ARE GOD'S FORMS BY WHICH HE GROWS IN MAN
THEY STAMP HIS THOUGHTS AND DEEDS WITH DIVINITY
UPLIFT THE STATURE OF THE HUMAN CLAY
OR SLOWLY TRANSMUTE IT INTO HEAVEN'S GOLD
HE IS THE GOOD FOR WHICH MEN FIGHT AND DIE
HE IS THE WAR OF RIGHT WITH TITAN WRONG
HE IS FREEDOM RISING DEATHLESS FROM HER PYRE
HE IS VALOUR GUARDING STILL THE DESPERATE PASS
OR LONE AND ERECT ON THE SHATTERED BARRICADE
516
OR A SENTINEL IN THE DANGEROUS ECHOING NIGHT
HE IS THE CROWN OF THE MARTYR BURNED IN FLAME
AND THE GLAD RESIGNATION OF THE SAINT
AND COURAGE INDIFFERENT TO THE WOUNDS OF TIME
AND THE HERO'S MIGHT WRESTLING WITH DEATH AND FATE
HE IS WISDOM INCARNATE ON A GLORIOUS THRONE
AND THE CALM AUTOCRACY OF THE SAGE'S RULE
HE IS THE HIGH AND SOLITARY THOUGHT
ALOOF ABOVE THE IGNORANT MULTITUDE
HE IS THE PROPHET'S VOICE THE SIGHT OF THE SEER
HE IS BEAUTY NECTAR OF THE PASSIONATE SOUL
HE IS THE TRUTH BY WHICH THE SPIRIT LIVES
HE IS THE RICHES OF THE SPIRITUAL VAST
POURED OUT IN HEALING STREAMS ON INDIGENT LIFE
HE IS ETERNITY LURED FROM HOUR TO HOUR
HE IS INFINITY IN A LITTLE SPACE
HE IS IMMORTALITY IN THE ARMS OF DEATH
THESE POWERS I AM AND AT MY CALL THEY COME
THUS SLOWLY I LIFT MAN'S SOUL NEARER THE LIGHT
BUT HUMAN MIND CLINGS TO ITS IGNORANCE
AND TO ITS LITTLENESS THE HUMAN HEART
AND TO ITS RIGHT TO GRIEF THE EARTHLY LIFE
ONLY WHEN ETERNITY TAKES TIME BY THE HAND
ONLY WHEN INFINITY WEDS THE FINITE'S THOUGHT
CAN MAN BE FREE FROM HIMSELF AND LIVE WITH GOD
I BRING MEANWHILE THE GODS UPON THE EARTH
I BRING BACK HOPE TO THE DESPAIRING HEART
I GIVE PEACE TO THE HUMBLE AND THE GREAT
AND SHED MY GRACE ON THE FOOLISH AND THE WISE
I SHALL SAVE EARTH IF EARTH CONSENTS TO BE SAVED
THEN LOVE SHALL AT LAST UNWOUNDED TREAD EARTH'S SOIL
MAN'S MIND SHALL ADMIT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF TRUTH
AND BODY BEAR THE IMMENSE DESCENT OF GOD
SHE SPOKE AND FROM THE IGNORANT NETHER PLANE
A CRY A WARPED ECHO NAKED AND SHUDDERING CAME
A VOICE OF THE SENSE-SHACKLED HUMAN MIND
517
CARRIED ITS PROUD COMPLAINT OF GODLIKE POWER
HEDGED BY THE LIMITS OF A MORTAL'S THOUGHTS
BOUND IN THE CHAINS OF EARTHLY IGNORANCE
IMPRISONED IN HIS BODY AND HIS BRAIN
THE MORTAL CANNOT SEE GOD'S MIGHTY WHOLE
OR SHARE IN HIS VAST AND DEEP IDENTITY
WHO STANDS UNGUESSED WITHIN OUR IGNORANT HEARTS
AND KNOWS ALL THINGS BECAUSE HE IS ONE WITH ALL
MAN ONLY SEES THE COSMIC SURFACES
THEN WONDERING WHAT MAY LIE HID FROM THE SENSE
A LITTLE WAY HE DELVES TO DEPTHS BELOW
BUT SOON HE STOPS HE CANNOT REACH LIFE'S CORE
OR COMMUNE WITH THE THROBBING HEART OF THINGS
HE SEES THE NAKED BODY OF THE TRUTH
THOUGH OFTEN BAFFLED BY HER ENDLESS GARBS
BUT CANNOT LOOK UPON HER SOUL WITHIN
THEN FURIOUS FOR A KNOWLEDGE ABSOLUTE
HE TEARS ALL DETAILS OUT AND STABS AND DIGS
ONLY THE SHAPE'S CONTENTS HE HOLDS FOR USE
THE SPIRIT ESCAPES OR DIES BENEATH HIS KNIFE
HE SEES AS A BLANK STRETCH A GIANT WASTE
THE CROWDING RICHES OF INFINITY
THE FINITE HE HAS MADE HIS CENTRAL FIELD
ITS PLAN DISSECTS MASTERS ITS PROCESSES
THAT WHICH MOVES ALL IS HIDDEN FROM HIS GAZE
HIS PORING EYES MISS THE UNSEEN BEHIND
HE HAS THE BLIND MAN'S SUBTLE UNERRING TOUCH
OR THE SLOW TRAVELLER'S SIGHT OF DISTANT SCENES
THE SOUL'S REVEALING CONTACTS ARE NOT HIS
YET IS HE VISITED BY INTUITIVE LIGHT
AND INSPIRATION COMES FROM THE UNKNOWN
BUT ONLY REASON AND SENSE HE FEELS AS SURE
THEY ONLY ARE HIS TRUSTED WITNESSES
THUS IS HE BAULKED HIS SPLENDID EFFORT VAIN
HIS KNOWLEDGE SCANS BRIGHT PEBBLES ON THE SHORE
OF THE HUGE OCEAN OF HIS IGNORANCE
518
YET GRANDIOSE WERE THE ACCENTS OF THAT CRY
A COSMIC PATHOS TREMBLED IN ITS TONE
I AM THE MIND OF GOD'S GREAT IGNORANT WORLD
ASCENDING TO KNOWLEDGE BY THE STEPS HE MADE
I AM THE ALL-DISCOVERING THOUGHT OF MAN
I AM A GOD FETTERED BY MATTER AND SENSE
AN ANIMAL PRISONED IN A FENCE OF THORNS
A BEAST OF LABOUR ASKING FOR HIS FOOD
A SMITH TIED TO HIS ANVIL AND HIS FORGE
YET HAVE I LOOSENED THE CORD ENLARGED MY ROOM
I HAVE MAPPED THE HEAVENS AND ANALYSED THE STARS
DESCRIBED THEIR ORBITS THROUGH THE GROOVES OF SPACE
MEASURED THE MILES THAT SEPARATE THE SUNS
COMPUTED THEIR LONGEVITY IN TIME
I HAVE DELVED INTO EARTH'S BOWELS AND TORN OUT
THE RICHES GUARDED BY HER DULL BROWN SOIL
I HAVE CLASSED THE CHANGES OF HER STONY CRUST
AND OF HER BIOGRAPHY DISCOVERED THE DATES
RESCUED THE PAGES OF ALL NATURE'S PLAN
THE TREE OF EVOLUTION I HAVE SKETCHED
EACH BRANCH AND TWIG AND LEAF IN ITS OWN PLACE
IN THE EMBRYO TRACKED THE HISTORY OF FORMS
AND THE GENEALOGY FRAMED OF ALL THAT LIVES
I HAVE DETECTED PLASM AND CELL AND GENE
THE PROTOZOA TRACED MAN'S ANCESTORS
THE HUMBLE ORIGINALS FROM WHOM HE ROSE
I KNOW HOW HE WAS BORN AND HOW HE DIES
ONLY WHAT END HE SERVES I KNOW NOT YET
OR IF THERE IS AIM AT ALL OR ANY END
OR PUSH OF RICH CREATIVE PURPOSEFUL JOY
IN THE WIDE WORKS OF THE TERRESTRIAL POWER
I HAVE CAUGHT HER INTRICATE PROCESSES NONE IS LEFT
HER HUGE MACHINERY IS IN MY HANDS
I HAVE SEIZED THE COSMIC ENERGIES FOR MY USE
I HAVE PORED ON HER INFINITESIMAL ELEMENTS
AND HER INVISIBLE ATOMS HAVE UNMASKED
519
ALL MATTER IS A BOOK I HAVE PERUSED
ONLY SOME PAGES NOW ARE LEFT TO READ
I HAVE SEEN THE WAYS OF LIFE THE PATHS OF MIND
I HAVE STUDIED THE METHODS OF THE ANT AND APE
AND THE BEHAVIOUR LEARNED OF MAN AND WORM
IF GOD IS AT WORK HIS SECRETS I HAVE FOUND
BUT STILL THE CAUSE OF THINGS IS LEFT IN DOUBT
THEIR TRUTH FLEES FROM PURSUIT INTO A VOID
WHEN ALL HAS BEEN EXPLAINED NOTHING IS KNOWN
WHAT CHOSE THE PROCESS WHENCE THE POWER SPRANG
I KNOW NOT AND PERHAPS SHALL NEVER KNOW
A MYSTERY IS THIS MIGHTY NATURE'S BIRTH
A MYSTERY IS THE ELUSIVE STREAM OF MIND
A MYSTERY THE PROTEAN FREAK OF LIFE
WHAT I HAVE LEARNED CHANCE LEAPS TO CONTRADICT
WHAT I HAVE BUILT IS SEIZED AND TORN BY FATE
I CAN FORESEE THE ACTS OF MATTER'S FORCE
BUT NOT THE MARCH OF THE DESTINY OF MAN
HE IS DRIVEN UPON PATHS HE DID NOT CHOOSE
HE FALLS TRAMPLED UNDERNEATH THE ROLLING WHEELS
MY GREAT PHILOSOPHIES ARE A REASONED GUESS
THE MYSTIC HEAVENS THAT CLAIM THE HUMAN SOUL
ARE A CHARLATANISM OF THE IMAGINING BRAIN
ALL IS A SPECULATION OR A DREAM
IN THE END THE WORLD ITSELF BECOMES A DOUBT
THE INFINITESIMAL'S JEST MOCKS MASS AND SHAPE
A LAUGH PEALS FROM THE INFINITE'S FINITE MASK
PERHAPS THE WORLD IS AN ERROR OF OUR SIGHT
A TRICK REPEATED IN EACH FLASH OF SENSE
AN UNREAL MIND HALLUCINATES THE SOUL
WITH A STRESS-VISION OF FALSE REALITY
OR A DANCE OF MAYA VEILS THE VOID UNBORN
EVEN IF A GREATER CONSCIOUSNESS I COULD REACH
WHAT PROFIT IS IT THEN FOR THOUGHT TO WIN
A REAL WHICH IS FOR EVER INEFFABLE
OR HUNT TO ITS LAIR THE BODILESS SELF OR MAKE
520
THE UNKNOWABLE THE TARGET OF THE SOUL
NAY LET ME WORK WITHIN MY MORTAL BOUNDS
NOT LIVE BEYOND LIFE NOR THINK BEYOND THE MIND
OUR SMALLNESS SAVES US FROM THE INFINITE
IN A FROZEN GRANDEUR LONE AND DESOLATE
CALL ME NOT TO DIE THE GREAT ETERNAL DEATH
LEFT NAKED OF MY OWN HUMANITY
IN THE CHILL VAST OF THE SPIRIT'S BOUNDLESSNESS
EACH CREATURE BY ITS NATURE'S LIMITS LIVES
AND HOW CAN ONE EVADE HIS NATIVE FATE
HUMAN I AM HUMAN LET ME REMAIN
TILL IN THE INCONSCIENT I FALL DUMB AND SLEEP
A HIGH INSANITY A CHIMAERA IS THIS
TO THINK THAT GOD LIVES HIDDEN IN THE CLAY
AND THAT ETERNAL TRUTH CAN DWELL IN TIME
AND CALL TO HER TO SAVE OUR SELF AND WORLD
HOW CAN MAN GROW IMMORTAL AND DIVINE
TRANSMUTING THE VERY STUFF OF WHICH HE IS MADE
THIS WIZARD GODS MAY DREAM NOT THINKING MEN
AND SAVITRI HEARD THE VOICE THE WARPED ANSWER HEARD
AND TURNING TO HER BEING OF LIGHT SHE SPOKE
MADONNA OF LIGHT MOTHER OF JOY AND PEACE
THOU ART A PORTION OF MY SELF PUT FORTH
TO RAISE THE SPIRIT TO ITS FORGOTTEN HEIGHTS
AND WAKE THE SOUL BY TOUCHES OF THE HEAVENS
BECAUSE THOU ART THE SOUL DRAWS NEAR TO GOD
BECAUSE THOU ART LOVE GROWS IN SPITE OF HATE
AND KNOWLEDGE WALKS UNSLAIN IN THE PIT OF NIGHT
BUT NOT BY SHOWERING HEAVEN'S GOLDEN RAIN
UPON THE INTELLECT'S HARD AND ROCKY SOIL
CAN THE TREE OF PARADISE FLOWER ON EARTHLY GROUND
AND THE BIRD OF PARADISE SIT UPON LIFE'S BOUGHS
AND THE WINDS OF PARADISE VISIT MORTAL AIR
EVEN IF THOU RAIN DOWN INTUITION'S RAYS
THE MIND OF MAN WILL THINK IT EARTH'S OWN GLEAM
HIS SPIRIT BY SPIRITUAL EGO SINK
521
OR HIS SOUL DREAM SHUT IN SAINTHOOD'S BRILLIANT CELL
WHERE ONLY A BRIGHT SHADOW OF GOD CAN COME
HIS HUNGER FOR THE ETERNAL THOU MUST NURSE
AND FILL HIS YEARNING HEART WITH HEAVEN'S FIRE
AND BRING GOD DOWN INTO HIS BODY AND LIFE
ONE DAY I WILL RETURN HIS HAND IN MINE
AND THOU SHALT SEE THE FACE OF THE ABSOLUTE
THEN SHALL THE HOLY MARRIAGE BE ACHIEVED
THEN SHALL THE DIVINE FAMILY BE BORN
THERE SHALL BE LIGHT AND PEACE IN ALL THE WORLDS
522
ONWARD SHE PASSED SEEKING THE SOUL'S MYSTIC CAVE
AT FIRST SHE STEPPED INTO A NIGHT OF GOD
THE LIGHT WAS QUENCHED THAT HELPS THE LABOURING WORLD
THE POWER THAT STRUGGLES AND STUMBLES IN OUR LIFE
THIS INEFFICIENT MIND GAVE UP ITS THOUGHTS
THE STRIVING HEART ITS UNAVAILING HOPES
ALL KNOWLEDGE FAILED AND THE IDEA'S FORMS
AND WISDOM SCREENED IN AWE HER LOWLY HEAD
FEELING A TRUTH TOO GREAT FOR THOUGHT OR SPEECH
FORMLESS INEFFABLE FOR EVER THE SAME
AN INNOCENT AND HOLY IGNORANCE
ADORED LIKE ONE WHO WORSHIPS FORMLESS GOD
THE UNSEEN LIGHT SHE COULD NOT CLAIM NOR OWN
IN A SIMPLE PURITY OF EMPTINESS
HER MIND KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE UNKNOWABLE
ALL WAS ABOLISHED SAVE HER NAKED SELF
AND THE PROSTRATE YEARNING OF HER SURRENDERED HEART
THERE WAS NO STRENGTH IN HER NO PRIDE OF FORCE
THE LOFTY BURNING OF DESIRE HAD SUNK
ASHAMED A VANITY OF SEPARATE SELF
THE HOPE OF SPIRITUAL GREATNESS FLED
SALVATION SHE ASKED NOT NOR A HEAVENLY CROWN
HUMILITY SEEMED NOW TOO PROUD A STATE
HER SELF WAS NOTHING GOD ALONE WAS ALL
YET GOD SHE KNEW NOT BUT ONLY KNEW HE WAS
A SACRED DARKNESS BROODED NOW WITHIN
THE WORLD WAS A DEEP DARKNESS GREAT AND NUDE
THIS VOID HELD MORE THAN ALL THE TEEMING WORLDS
THIS BLANK FELT MORE THAN ALL THAT TIME HAS BORNE
THIS DARK KNEW DUMBLY IMMENSELY THE UNKNOWN
BUT ALL WAS FORMLESS VOICELESS INFINITE
523
AS MIGHT A SHADOW WALK IN A SHADOWY SCENE
A SMALL NOUGHT PASSING THROUGH A MIGHTIER NOUGHT
A NIGHT OF PERSON IN A BARE OUTLINE
CROSSING A FATHOMLESS IMPERSONAL NIGHT
SILENT SHE MOVED EMPTY AND ABSOLUTE
IN ENDLESS TIME HER SOUL REACHED A WIDE END
THE SPACELESS VAST BECAME HER SPIRIT'S PLACE
AT LAST A CHANGE APPROACHED THE EMPTINESS BROKE
A WAVE RIPPLED WITHIN THE WORLD HAD STIRRED
ONCE MORE HER INNER SELF BECAME HER SPACE
THERE WAS FELT A BLISSFUL NEARNESS TO THE GOAL
HEAVEN LEANED LOW TO KISS THE SACRED HILL
THE AIR TREMBLED WITH PASSION AND DELIGHT
A ROSE OF SPLENDOUR ON A TREE OF DREAMS
THE FACE OF DAWN OUT OF MOONED TWILIGHT GREW
DAY CAME PRIEST OF A SACRIFICE OF JOY
INTO THE WORSHIPPING SILENCE OF HER WORLD
HE CARRIED IMMORTAL LUSTRE AS HIS ROBE
TRAILED HEAVEN LIKE A PURPLE SCARF AND WORE
AS HIS VERMILION CASTE-MARK A RED SUN
AS IF AN OLD REMEMBERED DREAM COME TRUE
SHE RECOGNISED IN HER PROPHETIC MIND
THE IMPERISHABLE LUSTRE OF THAT SKY
THE TREMULOUS SWEETNESS OF THAT HAPPY AIR
AND COVERED FROM MIND'S VIEW AND LIFE'S APPROACH
THE MYSTIC CAVERN IN THE SACRED HILL
AND KNEW THE DWELLING OF HER SECRET SOUL
AS IF IN SOME ELYSIAN OCCULT DEPTH
TRUTH'S LAST RETREAT FROM THOUGHT'S PROFANING TOUCH
AS IF IN A ROCK-TEMPLE'S SOLITUDE HID
GOD'S REFUGE FROM AN IGNORANT WORSHIPPING WORLD
IT LAY WITHDRAWN EVEN FROM LIFE'S INNER SENSE
RECEDING FROM THE ENTANGLED HEART'S DESIRE
A MARVELLOUS BROODING TWILIGHT MET THE EYES
AND A HOLY STILLNESS HELD THAT VOICELESS SPACE
AN AWFUL DIMNESS WRAPPED THE GREAT ROCK-DOORS
524
CARVED IN THE MASSIVE STONE OF MATTER'S TRANCE
TWO GOLDEN SERPENTS ROUND THE LINTEL CURLED
ENVELOPING IT WITH THEIR PURE AND DREADFUL STRENGTH
LOOKED OUT WITH WISDOM'S DEEP AND LUMINOUS EYES
AN EAGLE COVERED IT WITH WIDE CONQUERING WINGS
FLAMES OF SELF-LOST IMMOBILE REVERIE
DOVES CROWDED THE GREY MUSING CORNICES
LIKE SCULPTURED POSTURES OF WHITE-BOSOMED PEACE
ACROSS THE THRESHOLD'S SLEEP SHE ENTERED IN
AND FOUND HERSELF AMID GREAT FIGURES OF GODS
CONSCIOUS IN STONE AND LIVING WITHOUT BREATH
WATCHING WITH FIXED REGARD THE SOUL OF MAN
EXECUTIVE FIGURES OF THE COSMIC SELF
WORLD-SYMBOLS OF IMMUTABLE POTENCY
ON THE WALLS COVERED WITH SIGNIFICANT SHAPES
LOOKED AT HER THE LIFE-SCENE OF MAN AND BEAST
AND THE HIGH MEANING OF THE LIFE OF GODS
THE POWER AND NECESSITY OF THESE NUMBERLESS WORLDS
AND FACES OF BEINGS AND STRETCHES OF WORLD-SPACE
SPOKE THE SUCCINCT AND INEXHAUSTIBLE
HIERATIC MESSAGE OF THE CLIMBING PLANES
IN THEIR IMMENSITUDE SIGNING INFINITY
THEY WERE THE EXTENSION OF THE SELF OF GOD
AND HOUSED IMPASSIVELY RECEIVING ALL
HIS FIGURES AND HIS SMALL AND MIGHTY ACTS
AND HIS PASSION AND HIS BIRTH AND LIFE AND DEATH
AND HIS RETURN TO IMMORTALITY
TO THE ABIDING AND ETERNAL IS THEIR CLIMB
TO THE PURE EXISTENCE EVERYWHERE THE SAME
TO THE SHEER CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE ABSOLUTE FORCE
AND THE UNIMAGINABLE AND FORMLESS BLISS
TO THE MIRTH IN TIME AND THE TIMELESS MYSTERY
OF THE TRIUNE BEING WHO IS ALL AND ONE
AND YET IS NO ONE BUT HIMSELF APART
THERE WAS NO STEP OF BREATHING MEN NO SOUND
ONLY THE LIVING NEARNESS OF THE SOUL
525
YET ALL THE WORLDS AND GOD HIMSELF WERE THERE
FOR EVERY SYMBOL WAS A REALITY
AND BROUGHT THE PRESENCE WHICH HAD GIVEN IT LIFE
ALL THIS SHE SAW AND INLY FELT AND KNEW
NOT BY SOME THOUGHT OF MIND BUT BY THE SELF
A LIGHT NOT BORN OF SUN OR MOON OR FIRE
A LIGHT THAT DWELT WITHIN AND SAW WITHIN
SHEDDING AN INTIMATE VISIBILITY
MADE SECRECY MORE REVEALING THAN THE WORD
OUR SIGHT AND SENSE ARE A FALLIBLE GAZE AND TOUCH
AND ONLY THE SPIRIT'S VISION IS WHOLLY TRUE
AS THUS SHE PASSED IN THAT MYSTERIOUS PLACE
THROUGH ROOM AND ROOM THROUGH DOOR AND ROCK-HEWN DOOR
SHE FELT HERSELF MADE ONE WITH ALL SHE SAW
A SEALED IDENTITY WITHIN HER WOKE
SHE KNEW HERSELF THE BELOVED OF THE SUPREME
THESE GODS AND GODDESSES WERE HE AND SHE
THE MOTHER WAS SHE OF BEAUTY AND DELIGHT
THE WORD IN BRAHMA'S VAST CREATING CLASP
THE WORLD-PUISSANCE ON ALMIGHTY SHIVA'S LAP
THE MASTER AND THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVES
WATCHING THE WORLDS THEIR TWIN REGARD HAD MADE
AND KRISHNA AND RADHA FOR EVER ENTWINED IN BLISS
THE ADORER AND ADORED SELF-LOST AND ONE
IN THE LAST CHAMBER ON A GOLDEN SEAT
ONE SAT WHOSE SHAPE NO VISION COULD DEFINE
ONLY ONE FELT THE WORLD'S UNATTAINABLE FOUNT
A POWER OF WHICH SHE WAS A STRAYING FORCE
AN INVISIBLE BEAUTY GOAL OF THE WORLD'S DESIRE
A SUN OF WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE IS A BEAM
A GREATNESS WITHOUT WHOM NO LIFE COULD BE
THENCE ALL DEPARTED INTO SILENT SELF
AND ALL BECAME FORMLESS AND PURE AND BARE
THEN THROUGH A TUNNEL DUG IN THE LAST ROCK
SHE CAME OUT WHERE THERE SHONE A DEATHLESS SUN
A HOUSE WAS THERE ALL MADE OF FLAME AND LIGHT
526
AND CROSSING A WALL OF DOORLESS LIVING FIRE
THERE SUDDENLY SHE MET HER SECRET SOUL
A BEING STOOD IMMORTAL IN TRANSIENCE
DEATHLESS DALLYING WITH MOMENTARY THINGS
IN WHOSE WIDE EYES OF TRANQUIL HAPPINESS
WHICH PITY AND SORROW COULD NOT ABROGATE
INFINITY TURNED ITS GAZE ON FINITE SHAPES
OBSERVER OF THE SILENT STEPS OF THE HOURS
ETERNITY UPHELD THE MINUTE'S ACTS
AND THE PASSING SCENES OF THE EVERLASTING'S PLAY
IN THE MYSTERY OF ITS SELECTING WILL
IN THE DIVINE COMEDY A PARTICIPANT
THE SPIRIT'S CONSCIOUS REPRESENTATIVE
GOD'S DELEGATE IN OUR HUMANITY
COMRADE OF THE UNIVERSE THE TRANSCENDENT'S RAY
SHE HAD COME INTO THE MORTAL BODY'S ROOM
TO PLAY AT BALL WITH TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCE
A JOY IN THE WORLD HER MASTER MOVEMENT HERE
THE PASSION OF THE GAME LIGHTED HER EYES
A SMILE ON HER LIPS WELCOMED EARTH'S BLISS AND GRIEF
A LAUGH WAS HER RETURN TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
ALL THINGS SHE SAW AS A MASQUERADE OF TRUTH
DISGUISED IN THE COSTUMES OF IGNORANCE
CROSSING THE YEARS TO IMMORTALITY
ALL SHE COULD FRONT WITH THE STRONG SPIRIT'S PEACE
BUT SINCE SHE KNOWS THE TOIL OF MIND AND LIFE
AS A MOTHER FEELS AND SHARES HER CHILDREN'S LIVES
SHE PUTS FORTH A SMALL PORTION OF HERSELF
A BEING NO BIGGER THAN THE THUMB OF MAN
INTO A HIDDEN REGION OF THE HEART
TO FACE THE PANG AND TO FORGET THE BLISS
TO SHARE THE SUFFERING AND ENDURE EARTH'S WOUNDS
AND LABOUR MID THE LABOUR OF THE STARS
THIS IN US LAUGHS AND WEEPS SUFFERS THE STROKE
EXULTS IN VICTORY STRUGGLES FOR THE CROWN
527
IDENTIFIED WITH THE MIND AND BODY AND LIFE
IT TAKES ON ITSELF THEIR ANGUISH AND DEFEAT
BLEEDS WITH FATE'S WHIPS AND HANGS UPON THE CROSS
YET IS THE UNWOUNDED AND IMMORTAL SELF
SUPPORTING THE ACTOR IN THE HUMAN SCENE
THROUGH THIS SHE SENDS US HER GLORY AND HER POWERS
PUSHES TO WISDOM'S HEIGHTS THROUGH MISERY'S GULFS
SHE GIVES US STRENGTH TO DO OUR DAILY TASK
AND SYMPATHY THAT PARTAKES OF OTHERS' GRIEF
AND THE LITTLE STRENGTH WE HAVE TO HELP OUR RACE
WE WHO MUST FILL THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSE
ACTING ITSELF OUT IN A SLIGHT HUMAN SHAPE
AND ON OUR SHOULDERS CARRY THE STRUGGLING WORLD
THIS IS IN US THE GODHEAD SMALL AND MARRED
IN THIS HUMAN PORTION OF DIVINITY
SHE SEATS THE GREATNESS OF THE SOUL IN TIME
TO UPLIFT FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT FROM POWER TO POWER
TILL ON A HEAVENLY PEAK IT STANDS A KING
IN BODY WEAK IN ITS HEART AN INVINCIBLE MIGHT
IT CLIMBS STUMBLING HELD UP BY AN UNSEEN HAND
A TOILING SPIRIT IN A MORTAL SHAPE
HERE IN THIS CHAMBER OF FLAME AND LIGHT THEY MET
THEY LOOKED UPON EACH OTHER KNEW THEMSELVES
THE SECRET DEITY AND ITS HUMAN PART
THE CALM IMMORTAL AND THE STRUGGLING SOUL
THEN WITH A MAGIC TRANSFORMATION'S SPEED
THEY RUSHED INTO EACH OTHER AND GREW ONE
ONCE MORE SHE WAS HUMAN UPON EARTHLY SOIL
IN THE MUTTERING NIGHT AMID THE RAIN-SWEPT WOODS
AND THE RUDE COTTAGE WHERE SHE SAT IN TRANCE
THAT SUBTLE WORLD WITHDREW DEEPLY WITHIN
BEHIND THE SUN-VEIL OF THE INNER SIGHT
BUT NOW THE HALF-OPENED LOTUS BUD OF HER HEART
HAD BLOOMED AND STOOD DISCLOSED TO THE EARTHLY RAY
IN AN IMAGE SHONE REVEALED HER SECRET SOUL
528
THERE WAS NO WALL SEVERING THE SOUL AND MIND
NO MYSTIC FENCE GUARDING FROM THE CLAIMS OF LIFE
IN ITS DEEP LOTUS HOME HER BEING SAT
AS IF ON CONCENTRATION'S MARBLE SEAT
CALLING THE MIGHTY MOTHER OF THE WORLDS
TO MAKE THIS EARTHLY TENEMENT HER HOUSE
AS IN A FLASH FROM A SUPERNAL LIGHT
A LIVING IMAGE OF THE ORIGINAL POWER
A FACE A FORM CAME DOWN INTO HER HEART
AND MADE OF IT ITS TEMPLE AND PURE ABODE
BUT WHEN ITS FEET HAD TOUCHED THE QUIVERING BLOOM
A MIGHTY MOVEMENT ROCKED THE INNER SPACE
AS IF A WORLD WERE SHAKEN AND FOUND ITS SOUL
OUT OF THE INCONSCIENT'S SOULLESS MINDLESS NIGHT
A FLAMING SERPENT ROSE RELEASED FROM SLEEP
IT ROSE BILLOWING ITS COILS AND STOOD ERECT
AND CLIMBING MIGHTILY STORMILY ON ITS WAY
IT TOUCHED HER CENTRES WITH ITS FLAMING MOUTH
AS IF A FIERY KISS HAD BROKEN THEIR SLEEP
THEY BLOOMED AND LAUGHED SURCHARGED WITH LIGHT AND BLISS
THEN AT THE CROWN IT JOINED THE ETERNAL'S SPACE
IN THE FLOWER OF THE HEAD IN THE FLOWER OF MATTER'S BASE
IN EACH DIVINE STRONGHOLD AND NATURE-KNOT
IT HELD TOGETHER THE MYSTIC STREAM WHICH JOINS
THE VIEWLESS SUMMITS WITH THE UNSEEN DEPTHS
THE STRING OF FORTS THAT MAKE THE FRAIL DEFENCE
SAFEGUARDING US AGAINST THE ENORMOUS WORLD
OUR LINES OF SELF-EXPRESSION IN ITS VAST
AN IMAGE SAT OF THE ORIGINAL POWER
WEARING THE MIGHTY MOTHER'S FORM AND FACE
ARMED BEARER OF THE WEAPON AND THE SIGN
WHOSE OCCULT MIGHT NO MAGIC CAN IMITATE
MANIFOLD YET ONE SHE SAT A GUARDIAN FORCE
A SAVIOUR GESTURE STRETCHED HER LIFTED ARM
AND SYMBOL OF SOME NATIVE COSMIC STRENGTH
A SACRED BEAST LAY PRONE BELOW HER FEET
529
A SILENT FLAME-EYED MASS OF LIVING FORCE
ALL UNDERWENT A HIGH CELESTIAL CHANGE
BREAKING THE BLACK INCONSCIENT'S BLIND MUTE WALL
EFFACING THE CIRCLES OF THE IGNORANCE
POWERS AND DIVINITIES BURST FLAMING FORTH
EACH PART OF THE BEING TREMBLING WITH DELIGHT
LAY OVERWHELMED WITH TIDES OF HAPPINESS
AND SAW HER HAND IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE
AND FELT HER TOUCH IN EVERY LIMB AND CELL
IN THE COUNTRY OF THE LOTUS OF THE HEAD
WHICH THINKING MIND HAS MADE ITS BUSY SPACE
IN THE CASTLE OF THE LOTUS TWIXT THE BROWS
WHENCE IT SHOOTS THE ARROWS OF ITS SIGHT AND WILL
IN THE PASSAGE OF THE LOTUS OF THE THROAT
WHERE SPEECH MUST RISE AND THE EXPRESSING MIND
AND THE HEART'S IMPULSE RUN TOWARDS WORD AND ACT
A GLAD UPLIFT AND A NEW WORKING CAME
THE IMMORTAL'S THOUGHTS DISPLACED OUR BOUNDED VIEW
THE IMMORTAL'S THOUGHTS EARTH'S DRAB IDEA AND SENSE
ALL THINGS NOW BORE A DEEPER HEAVENLIER SENSE
A G LAD CLEAR HARMONY MARKED THEIR TRUTH'S OUTLINE
RESET THE BALANCE AND MEASURES OF THE WORLD
EACH SHAPE SHOWED ITS OCCULT DESIGN UNVEILED
GOD'S MEANING IN IT FOR WHICH IT WAS MADE
AND THE VIVID SPLENDOUR OF HIS ARTIST THOUGHT
A CHANNEL OF THE MIGHTY MOTHER'S CHOICE
THE IMMORTAL'S WILL TOOK INTO ITS CALM CONTROL
OUR BLIND OR ERRING GOVERNMENT OF LIFE
A LOOSE REPUBLIC ONCE OF WANTS AND NEEDS
THEN BOWED TO THE UNCERTAIN SOVEREIGN MIND
LIFE NOW OBEYED TO A DIVINER RULE
AND EVERY ACT BECAME AN ACT OF GOD
IN THE KINGDOM OF THE LOTUS OF THE HEART
LOVE CHANTING ITS PURE HYMENEAL HYMN
MADE LIFE AND BODY MIRRORS OF SACRED JOY
AND ALL THE EMOTIONS GAVE THEMSELVES TO GOD
530
IN THE NAVEL LOTUS' BROAD IMPERIAL RANGE
ITS PROUD AMBITIONS AND ITS MASTER LUSTS
WERE TAMED INTO INSTRUMENTS OF A GREAT CALM SWAY
TO DO A WORK OF GOD ON EARTHLY SOIL
IN THE NARROW NETHER CENTRE'S PETTY PARTS
ITS CHILDISH GAME OF DAILY DWARF DESIRES
WAS CHANGED INTO A SWEET AND BOISTEROUS PLAY
A ROMP OF LITTLE GODS WITH LIFE IN TIME
IN THE DEEP PLACE WHERE ONCE THE SERPENT SLEPT
THERE CAME A GRIP ON MATTER'S GIANT POWERS
FOR LARGE UTILITIES IN LIFE'S LITTLE SPACE
A FIRM GROUND WAS MADE FOR HEAVEN'S DESCENDING MIGHT
BEHIND ALL REIGNED HER SOVEREIGN DEATHLESS SOUL
CASTING ASIDE ITS VEIL OF IGNORANCE
ALLIED TO GODS AND COSMIC BEINGS AND POWERS
IT BUILT THE HARMONY OF ITS HUMAN STATE
SURRENDERED INTO THE GREAT WORLD-MOTHER'S HANDS
ONLY SHE OBEYED HER SOLE SUPREME BEHEST
IN THE ENIGMA OF THE INCONSCIENT'S WORLD
A SECRET SOUL BEHIND SUPPORTING ALL
IS MASTER AND WITNESS OF OUR IGNORANT LIFE
ADMITS THE PERSON'S LOOK AND NATURE'S ROLE
BUT ONCE THE HIDDEN DOORS ARE FLUNG APART
THEN THE VEILED KING STEPS OUT IN NATURE'S FRONT
A LIGHT COMES DOWN INTO THE IGNORANCE
ITS HEAVY PAINFUL KNOT LOOSENS ITS GRASP
THE MIND BECOMES A MASTERED INSTRUMENT
AND LIFE A HUE AND FIGURE OF THE SOUL
ALL HAPPILY GROWS TOWARDS KNOWLEDGE AND TOWARDS BLISS
A DIVINE PUISSANCE THEN TAKES NATURE'S PLACE
AND PUSHES THE MOVEMENTS OF OUR BODY AND MIND
POSSESSOR OF OUR PASSIONATE HOPES AND DREAMS
THE BELOVED DESPOT OF OUR THOUGHTS AND ACTS
SHE STREAMS INTO US WITH HER UNBOUND FORCE
INTO MORTAL LIMBS THE IMMORTAL'S RAPTURE AND POWER
AN INNER LAW OF BEAUTY SHAPES OUR LIVES
531
OUR WORDS BECOME THE NATURAL SPEECH OF TRUTH
EACH THOUGHT IS A RIPPLE ON A SEA OF LIGHT
THEN SIN AND VIRTUE LEAVE THE COSMIC LISTS
THEY STRUGGLE NO MORE IN OUR DELIVERED HEARTS
OUR ACTS CHIME WITH GOD'S SIMPLE NATURAL GOOD
OR SERVE THE RULE OF A SUPERNAL RIGHT
ALL MOODS UNLOVELY EVIL AND UNTRUE
FORSAKE THEIR STATIONS IN FIERCE DISARRAY
AND HIDE THEIR SHAME IN THE SUBCONSCIENT'S DUSK
THEN LIFTS THE MIND A CRY OF VICTORY
O SOUL MY SOUL WE HAVE CREATED HEAVEN
WITHIN WE HAVE FOUND THE KINGDOM HERE OF GOD
HIS FORTRESS BUILT IN A LOUD IGNORANT WORLD
OUR LIFE IS ENTRENCHED BETWEEN TWO RIVERS OF LIGHT
WE HAVE TURNED SPACE INTO A GULF OF PEACE
AND MADE THE BODY A CAPITOL OF BLISS
WHAT MORE WHAT MORE IF MORE MUST STILL BE DONE
IN THE SLOW PROCESS OF THE EVOLVING SPIRIT
IN THE BRIEF STADE BETWEEN A DEATH AND BIRTH
A FIRST PERFECTION'S STAGE IS REACHED AT LAST
OUT OF THE WOOD AND STONE OF OUR NATURE'S STUFF
A TEMPLE IS SHAPED WHERE THE HIGH GODS COULD LIVE
EVEN IF THE STRUGGLING WORLD IS LEFT OUTSIDE
ONE MAN'S PERFECTION STILL CAN SAVE THE WORLD
THERE IS WON A NEW PROXIMITY TO THE SKIES
A FIRST BETROTHAL OF THE EARTH TO HEAVEN
A DEEP CONCORDAT BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIFE
A CAMP OF GOD IS PITCHED IN HUMAN TIME
532
A CALM SLOW SUN LOOKED DOWN FROM TRANQUIL HEAVENS
A ROUTED SULLEN REARGUARD OF RETREAT
THE LAST RAINS HAD FLED MURMURING ACROSS THE WOODS
OR FAILED A SIBILANT WHISPER MID THE LEAVES
AND THE GREAT BLUE ENCHANTMENT OF THE SKY
RECOVERED THE DEEP RAPTURE OF ITS SMILE
ITS MELLOW SPLENDOUR UNSTRESSED BY STORM-LICKED HEATS
FOUND ROOM FOR A LUXURY OF WARM MILD DAYS
THE NIGHT'S GOLD TREASURE OF AUTUMNAL MOONS
CAME FLOATING SHIPPED THROUGH RIPPLES OF FAERY AIR
AND SAVITRI'S LIFE WAS GLAD FULFILLED LIKE EARTH'S
SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF SHE KNEW HER BEING'S AIM
ALTHOUGH HER KINGDOM OF MARVELLOUS CHANGE WITHIN
REMAINED UNSPOKEN IN HER SECRET BREAST
ALL THAT LIVED ROUND HER FELT ITS MAGIC'S CHARM
THE TREES' RUSTLING VOICES TOLD IT TO THE WINDS
FLOWERS SPOKE IN ARDENT HUES AN UNKNOWN JOY
THE BIRDS' CAROLLING BECAME A CANTICLE
THE BEASTS FORGOT THEIR STRIFE AND LIVED AT EASE
ABSORBED IN WIDE COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN
THE MILD ASCETICS OF THE WOOD RECEIVED
A SUDDEN GREATENING OF THEIR LONELY MUSE
THIS BRIGHT PERFECTION OF HER INNER STATE
POURED OVERFLOWING INTO HER OUTWARD SCENE
MADE BEAUTIFUL DULL COMMON NATURAL THINGS
AND ACTION WONDERFUL AND TIME DIVINE
EVEN THE SMALLEST MEANEST WORK BECAME
A SWEET OR GLAD AND GLORIOUS SACRAMENT
AN OFFERING TO THE SELF OF THE GREAT WORLD
OR A SERVICE TO THE ONE IN EACH AND ALL
533
A LIGHT INVADED ALL FROM HER BEING'S LIGHT
HER HEART-BEATS' DANCE COMMUNICATED BLISS
HAPPINESS GREW HAPPIER SHARED WITH HER BY HER TOUCH
AND GRIEF SOME SOLACE FOUND WHEN SHE DREW NEAR
ABOVE THE CHERISHED HEAD OF SATYAVAN
SHE SAW NOT NOW FATE'S DARK AND LETHAL ORB
A GOLDEN CIRCLE ROUND A MYSTIC SUN
DISCLOSED TO HER NEW-BORN PREDICTING SIGHT
THE CYCLIC RONDURE OF A SOVEREIGN LIFE
IN HER VISIONS AND DEEP-ETCHED VERIDICAL DREAMS
IN BRIEF SHIFTINGS OF THE FUTURE'S HEAVY SCREEN
HE LAY NOT BY A DOLOROUS DECREE
A VICTIM IN THE DISMAL ANTRE OF DEATH
OR BORNE TO BLISSFUL REGIONS FAR FROM HER
FORGETTING THE SWEETNESS OF EARTH'S WARM DELIGHT
FORGETTING THE PASSIONATE ONENESS OF LOVE'S CLASP
ABSOLVED IN THE SELF-RAPT IMMORTAL'S BLISS
ALWAYS HE WAS WITH HER A LIVING SOUL
THAT MET HER EYES WITH CLOSE ENAMOURED EYES
A LIVING BODY NEAR TO HER BODY'S JOY
BUT NOW NO LONGER IN THESE GREAT WILD WOODS
IN KINSHIP WITH THE DAYS OF BIRD AND BEAST
AND LEVELLED TO THE BARENESS OF EARTH'S BROWN BREAST
BUT MID THE THINKING HIGH-BUILT LIVES OF MEN
IN TAPESTRIED CHAMBERS AND ON CRYSTAL FLOORS
IN ARMOURED TOWN OR GARDENED PLEASURE-WALKS
EVEN IN DISTANCE CLOSER THAN HER THOUGHTS
BODY TO BODY NEAR SOUL NEAR TO SOUL
MOVING AS IF BY A COMMON BREATH AND WILL
THEY WERE TIED IN THE SINGLE CIRCLING OF THEIR DAYS
TOGETHER BY LOVE'S UNSEEN ATMOSPHERE
INSEPARABLE LIKE THE EARTH AND SKY
THUS FOR A WHILE SHE TROD THE GOLDEN PATH
THIS WAS THE SUN BEFORE ABYSMAL NIGHT
ONCE AS SHE SAT IN DEEP FELICITOUS MUSE
STILL QUIVERING FROM HER LOVER'S STRONG EMBRACE
534
AND MADE HER JOY A BRIDGE TWIXT EARTH AND HEAVEN
AN ABYSS YAWNED SUDDENLY BENEATH HER HEART
A VAST AND NAMELESS FEAR DRAGGED AT HER NERVES
AS DRAGS A WILD BEAST ITS HALF-SLAUGHTERED PREY
IT SEEMED TO HAVE NO DEN FROM WHICH IT SPRANG
IT WAS NOT HERS BUT HID ITS UNSEEN CAUSE
THEN RUSHING CAME ITS VAST AND FEARFUL FOUNT
A FORMLESS DREAD WITH SHAPELESS ENDLESS WINGS
FILLING THE UNIVERSE WITH ITS DANGEROUS BREATH
A DENSER DARKNESS THAN THE NIGHT COULD BEAR
ENVELOPED THE HEAVENS AND POSSESSED THE EARTH
A ROLLING SURGE OF SILENT DEATH IT CAME
CURVING ROUND THE FAR EDGE OF THE QUAKING GLOBE
EFFACING HEAVEN WITH ITS ENORMOUS STRIDE
IT WILLED TO EXPUNGE THE CHOKED AND ANGUISHED AIR
AND END THE FABLE OF THE JOY OF LIFE
IT SEEMED HER VERY BEING TO FORBID
ABOLISHING ALL BY WHICH HER NATURE LIVED
AND LABOURED TO BLOT OUT HER BODY AND SOUL
A CLUTCH OF SOME HALF-SEEN INVISIBLE
AN OCEAN OF TERROR AND OF SOVEREIGN MIGHT
A PERSON AND A BLACK INFINITY
IT SEEMED TO CRY TO HER WITHOUT THOUGHT OR WORD
THE MESSAGE OF ITS DARK ETERNITY
AND THE AWFUL MEANING OF ITS SILENCES
OUT OF SOME SULLEN MONSTROUS VAST ARISEN
OUT OF AN ABYSMAL DEEP OF GRIEF AND FEAR
IMAGINED BY SOME BLIND REGARDLESS SELF
A CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING WITHOUT ITS JOY
EMPTY OF THOUGHT INCAPABLE OF BLISS
THAT FELT LIFE BLANK AND NOWHERE FOUND A SOUL
A VOICE TO THE DUMB ANGUISH OF THE HEART
CONVEYED A STARK SENSE OF UNSPOKEN WORDS
IN HER OWN DEPTHS SHE HEARD THE UNUTTERED THOUGHT
THAT MADE UNREAL THE WORLD AND ALL LIFE MEANT
WHO ART THOU WHO CLAIMST THY CROWN OF SEPARATE BIRTH
535
THE ILLUSION OF THY SOUL'S REALITY
AND PERSONAL GODHEAD ON AN IGNORANT GLOBE
IN THE ANIMAL BODY OF IMPERFECT MAN
HOPE NOT TO BE HAPPY IN A WORLD OF PAIN
AND DREAM NOT LISTENING TO THE UNSPOKEN WORD
AND DAZZLED BY THE INEXPRESSIBLE RAY
TRANSCENDING THE MUTE SUPERCONSCIENT'S REALM
TO GIVE A BODY TO THE UNKNOWABLE
OR FOR A SANCTION TO THY HEART'S DELIGHT
TO BURDEN WITH BLISS THE SILENT STILL SUPREME
PROFANING ITS BARE AND FORMLESS SANCTITY
OR CALL INTO THY CHAMBER THE DIVINE
AND SIT WITH GOD TASTING A HUMAN JOY
I HAVE CREATED ALL ALL I DEVOUR
I AM DEATH AND THE DARK TERRIBLE MOTHER OF LIFE
I AM KALI BLACK AND NAKED IN THE WORLD
I AM MAYA AND THE UNIVERSE IS MY CHEAT
I LAY WASTE HUMAN HAPPINESS WITH MY BREATH
AND SLAY THE WILL TO LIVE THE JOY TO BE
THAT ALL MAY PASS BACK INTO NOTHINGNESS
AND ONLY ABIDE THE ETERNAL AND ABSOLUTE
FOR ONLY THE BLANK ETERNAL CAN BE TRUE
ALL ELSE IS SHADOW AND FLASH IN MIND'S BRIGHT GLASS
MIND HOLLOW MIRROR IN WHICH IGNORANCE SEES
A SPLENDID FIGURE OF ITS OWN FALSE SELF
AND DREAMS IT SEES A GLORIOUS SOLID WORLD
O SOUL INVENTOR OF MAN'S THOUGHTS AND HOPES
THYSELF THE INVENTION OF THE MOMENTS' STREAM
ILLUSION'S CENTRE OR SUBTLE APEX POINT
AT LAST KNOW THYSELF FROM VAIN EXISTENCE CEASE
A SHADOW OF THE NEGATING ABSOLUTE
THE INTOLERANT DARKNESS TRAVELLED SURGING PAST
AND EBBED IN HER THE FORMIDABLE VOICE
IT LEFT BEHIND HER INNER WORLD LAID WASTE
A BARREN SILENCE WEIGHED UPON HER HEART
HER KINGDOM OF DELIGHT WAS THERE NO MORE
536
ONLY HER SOUL REMAINED ITS EMPTIED STAGE
AWAITING THE UNKNOWN ETERNAL WILL
THEN FROM THE HEIGHTS A GREATER VOICE CAME DOWN
THE WORD THAT TOUCHES THE HEART AND FINDS THE SOUL
THE VOICE OF LIGHT AFTER THE VOICE OF NIGHT
THE CRY OF THE ABYSS DREW HEAVEN'S REPLY
A MIGHT OF STORM CHASED BY THE MIGHT OF THE SUN
O SOUL BARE NOT THY KINGDOM TO THE FOE
CONSENT TO HIDE THY ROYALTY OF BLISS
LEST TIME AND FATE FIND OUT ITS AVENUES
AND BEAT WITH THUNDEROUS KNOCK UPON THY GATES
HIDE WHILST THOU CANST THY TREASURE OF SEPARATE SELF
BEHIND THE LUMINOUS RAMPART OF THY DEPTHS
TILL OF A VASTER EMPIRE IT GROWS PART
BUT NOT FOR SELF ALONE THE SELF IS WON
CONTENT ABIDE NOT WITH ONE CONQUERED REALM
ADVENTURE ALL TO MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD THINE
TO BREAK INTO GREATER KINGDOMS TURN THY FORCE
FEAR NOT TO BE NOTHING THAT THOU MAYST BE ALL
ASSENT TO THE EMPTINESS OF THE SUPREME
THAT ALL IN THEE MAY REACH ITS ABSOLUTE
ACCEPT TO BE SMALL AND HUMAN ON THE EARTH
INTERRUPTING THY NEW-BORN DIVINITY
THAT MAN MAY FIND HIS UTTER SELF IN GOD
IF FOR THY OWN SAKE ONLY THOU HAST COME
AN IMMORTAL SPIRIT INTO THE MORTAL'S WORLD
TO FOUND THY LUMINOUS KINGDOM IN GOD'S DARK
IN THE INCONSCIENT'S REALM ONE SHINING STAR
ONE DOOR IN THE IGNORANCE OPENED UPON LIGHT
WHY HADST THOU ANY NEED TO COME AT ALL
THOU HAST COME DOWN INTO A STRUGGLING WORLD
TO AID A BLIND AND SUFFERING MORTAL RACE
TO OPEN TO LIGHT THE EYES THAT COULD NOT SEE
TO BRING DOWN BLISS INTO THE HEART OF GRIEF
TO MAKE THY LIFE A BRIDGE TWIXT EARTH AND HEAVEN
IF THOU WOULDST SAVE THE TOILING UNIVERSE
537
THE VAST UNIVERSAL SUFFERING FEEL AS THINE
THOU MUST BEAR THE SORROW THAT THOU CLAIMST TO HEAL
THE DAY-BRINGER MUST WALK IN DARKEST NIGHT
HE WHO WOULD SAVE THE WORLD MUST SHARE ITS PAIN
IF HE KNOWS NOT GRIEF HOW SHALL HE FIND GRIEF'S CURE
IF FAR HE WALKS ABOVE MORTALITY'S HEAD
HOW SHALL THE MORTAL REACH THAT TOO HIGH PATH
IF ONE OF THEIRS THEY SEE SCALE HEAVEN'S PEAKS
MEN THEN CAN HOPE TO LEARN THAT TITAN CLIMB
GOD MUST BE BORN ON EARTH AND BE AS MAN
THAT MAN BEING HUMAN MAY GROW EVEN AS GOD
HE WHO WOULD SAVE THE WORLD MUST BE ONE WITH THE WORLD
ALL SUFFERING THINGS CONTAIN IN HIS HEART'S SPACE
AND BEAR THE GRIEF AND JOY OF ALL THAT LIVES
HIS SOUL MUST BE WIDER THAN THE UNIVERSE
AND FEEL ETERNITY AS ITS VERY STUFF
REJECTING THE MOMENT'S PERSONALITY
KNOW ITSELF OLDER THAN THE BIRTH OF TIME
CREATION AN INCIDENT IN ITS CONSCIOUSNESS
ARCTURUS AND BELPHEGOR GRAINS OF FIRE
CIRCLING IN A CORNER OF ITS BOUNDLESS SELF
THE WORLD'S DESTRUCTION A SMALL TRANSIENT STORM
IN THE CALM INFINITY IT HAS BECOME
IF THOU WOULDST A LITTLE LOOSEN THE VAST CHAIN
DRAW BACK FROM THE WORLD THAT THE IDEA HAS MADE
THY MIND'S SELECTION FROM THE INFINITE
THY SENSES' GLOSS ON THE INFINITESIMAL'S DANCE
THEN SHALT THOU KNOW HOW THE GREAT BONDAGE CAME
BANISH ALL THOUGHT FROM THEE AND BE GOD'S VOID
THEN SHALT THOU UNCOVER THE UNKNOWABLE
AND THE SUPERCONSCIENT CONSCIOUS GROW ON THY TOPS
INFINITY'S VISION THROUGH THY GAZE SHALL PIERCE
THOU SHALT LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE UNKNOWN
FIND THE HID TRUTH IN THINGS SEEN NULL AND FALSE
BEHIND THINGS KNOWN DISCOVER MYSTERY'S REAR
THOU SHALT BE ONE WITH GOD'S BARE REALITY
538
AND THE MIRACULOUS WORLD HE HAS BECOME
AND THE DIVINER MIRACLE STILL TO BE
WHEN NATURE WHO IS NOW UNCONSCIOUS GOD
TRANSLUCENT GROWS TO THE ETERNAL'S LIGHT
HER SEEING HIS SIGHT HER WALK HIS STEPS OF POWER
AND LIFE IS FILLED WITH A SPIRITUAL JOY
AND MATTER IS THE SPIRIT'S WILLING BRIDE
CONSENT TO BE NOTHING AND NONE DISSOLVE TIME'S WORK
CAST OFF THY MIND STEP BACK FROM FORM AND NAME
ANNUL THYSELF THAT ONLY GOD MAY BE
THUS SPOKE THE MIGHTY AND UPLIFTING VOICE
AND SAVITRI HEARD SHE BOWED HER HEAD AND MUSED
PLUNGING HER DEEP REGARD INTO HERSELF
IN HER SOUL'S PRIVACY IN THE SILENT NIGHT
ALOOF AND STANDING BACK DETACHED AND CALM
A WITNESS OF THE DRAMA OF HERSELF
A STUDENT OF HER OWN INTERIOR SCENE
SHE WATCHED THE PASSION AND THE TOIL OF LIFE
AND HEARD IN THE CROWDED THOROUGHFARES OF MIND
THE UNCEASING TREAD AND PASSAGE OF HER THOUGHTS
ALL SHE ALLOWED TO RISE THAT CHOSE TO STIR
CALLING COMPELLING NOUGHT FORBIDDING NOUGHT
SHE LEFT ALL TO THE PROCESS FORMED IN TIME
AND THE FREE INITIATIVE OF NATURE'S WILL
THUS FOLLOWING THE COMPLEX HUMAN PLAY
SHE HEARD THE PROMPTER'S VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES
PERCEIVED THE ORIGINAL LIBRETTO'S SET
AND THE ORGAN THEME OF THE COMPOSER FORCE
ALL SHE BEHELD THAT SURGES FROM MAN'S DEPTHS
THE ANIMAL INSTINCTS PROWLING MID LIFE'S TREES
THE IMPULSES THAT WHISPER TO THE HEART
AND PASSION'S THUNDER-CHASE SWEEPING THE NERVES
SHE SAW THE POWERS THAT STARE FROM THE ABYSS
AND THE WORDLESS LIGHT THAT LIBERATES THE SOUL
BUT MOST HER GAZE PURSUED THE BIRTH OF THOUGHT
539
AFFRANCHISED FROM THE LOOK OF SURFACE MIND
SHE PAUSED NOT TO SURVEY THE OFFICIAL CASE
THE ISSUE OF FORMS FROM THE OFFICE OF THE BRAIN
ITS FACTORY OF THOUGHT-SOUNDS AND SOUNDLESS WORDS
AND VOICES STORED WITHIN UNHEARD BY MEN
ITS MINT AND TREASURY OF SHINING COIN
THESE WERE BUT COUNTERS IN MIND'S SYMBOL GAME
A GRAMOPHONE'S DISCS A REPRODUCTION'S FILM
A LIST OF SIGNS A CIPHER AND A CODE
IN OUR UNSEEN SUBTLE BODY THOUGHT IS BORN
OR THERE IT ENTERS FROM THE COSMIC FIELD
OFT FROM HER SOUL STEPPED OUT A NAKED THOUGHT
LUMINOUS WITH MYSTERIED LIPS AND WONDERFUL EYES
OR FROM HER HEART EMERGED SOME BURNING FACE
AND LOOKED FOR LIFE AND LOVE AND PASSIONATE TRUTH
ASPIRED TO HEAVEN OR EMBRACED THE WORLD
OR LED THE FANCY LIKE A FLEETING MOON
ACROSS THE DULL SKY OF MAN'S COMMON DAYS
AMIDST THE DOUBTFUL CERTITUDES OF EARTH'S LORE
TO THE CELESTIAL BEAUTY OF FAITH GAVE FORM
AS IF AT FLOWER-PRINTS IN A DINGY ROOM
LAUGHED IN A GOLDEN VASE ONE LIVING ROSE
A THAUMATURGIST SAT IN HER HEART'S DEEP
COMPELLED THE FORWARD STRIDE THE UPWARD LOOK
TILL WONDER LEAPED INTO THE ILLUMINED BREAST
AND LIFE GREW MARVELLOUS WITH TRANSFIGURING HOPE
A SEEING WILL PONDERED BETWEEN THE BROWS
THOUGHTS GLISTENING ANGELS STOOD BEHIND THE BRAIN
IN FLASHING ARMOUR FOLDING HANDS OF PRAYER
AND POURED HEAVEN'S RAYS INTO THE EARTHLY FORM
IMAGINATIONS FLAMED UP FROM HER BREAST
UNEARTHLY BEAUTY TOUCHES OF SURPASSING JOY
AND PLANS OF MIRACLE DREAMS OF DELIGHT
AROUND HER NAVEL LOTUS CLUSTERING CLOSE
HER LARGE SENSATIONS OF THE TEEMING WORLDS
STREAMED THEIR DUMB MOVEMENTS OF THE UNFORMED IDEA
540
INVADING THE SMALL SENSITIVE FLOWER OF THE THROAT
THEY BROUGHT THEIR MUTE UNUTTERED RESONANCES
TO KINDLE THE FIGURES OF A HEAVENLY SPEECH
BELOW DESIRES FORMED THEIR WORDLESS WISH
AND LONGINGS OF PHYSICAL SWEETNESS AND ECSTASY
TRANSLATED INTO THE ACCENTS OF A CRY
THEIR GRASP ON OBJECTS AND THEIR CLASP ON SOULS
HER BODY'S THOUGHTS CLIMBED FROM HER CONSCIOUS LIMBS
AND CARRIED THEIR YEARNINGS TO ITS MYSTIC CROWN
WHERE NATURE'S MURMURS MEET THE INEFFABLE
BUT FOR THE MORTAL PRISONED IN OUTWARD MIND
ALL MUST PRESENT THEIR PASSPORTS AT ITS DOOR
DISGUISED THEY MUST DON THE OFFICIAL CAP AND MASK
OR PASS AS MANUFACTURES OF THE BRAIN
UNKNOWN THEIR SECRET TRUTH AND HIDDEN SOURCE
ONLY TO THE INNER MIND THEY SPEAK DIRECT
PUT ON A BODY AND ASSUME A VOICE
THEIR PASSAGE SEEN THEIR MESSAGE HEARD AND KNOWN
THEIR BIRTHPLACE AND THEIR NATAL MARK REVEALED
AND STAND CONFESSED TO AN IMMORTAL'S SIGHT
OUR NATURE'S MESSENGERS TO THE WITNESS SOUL
IMPENETRABLE WITHHELD FROM MORTAL SENSE
THE INNER CHAMBERS OF THE SPIRIT'S HOUSE
DISCLOSED TO HER THEIR HAPPENINGS AND THEIR GUESTS
EYES LOOKED THROUGH CREVICES IN THE INVISIBLE WALL
AND THROUGH THE SECRECY OF UNSEEN DOORS
THERE CAME INTO MIND'S LITTLE FRONTAL ROOM
THOUGHTS THAT ENLARGED OUR LIMITED HUMAN RANGE
LIFTED THE IDEAL'S HALF-QUENCHED OR SINKING TORCH
OR PEERED THROUGH THE FINITE AT THE INFINITE
A SIGHT OPENED UPON THE INVISIBLE
AND SENSED THE SHAPES THAT MORTAL EYES SEE NOT
THE SOUNDS THAT MORTAL LISTENING CANNOT HEAR
THE BLISSFUL SWEETNESS OF THE INTANGIBLE'S TOUCH
THE OBJECTS THAT TO US ARE EMPTY AIR
ARE THERE THE STUFF OF DAILY EXPERIENCE
541
AND THE COMMON PABULUM OF SENSE AND THOUGHT
THE BEINGS OF THE SUBTLE REALMS APPEARED
AND SCENES CONCEALED BEHIND OUR EARTHLY SCENE
SHE SAW THE LIFE OF REMOTE CONTINENTS
AND DISTANCE DEAFENED NOT TO VOICES FAR
SHE FELT THE MOVEMENTS CROSSING UNKNOWN MINDS
THE PAST'S EVENTS OCCURRED BEFORE HER EYES
THE GREAT WORLD'S THOUGHTS WERE PART OF HER OWN THOUGHT
THE FEELINGS DUMB FOR EVER AND UNSHARED
THE IDEAS THAT NEVER FOUND AN UTTERANCE
THE DIM SUBCONSCIENT'S INCOHERENT HINTS
LAID BARE A MEANING TWISTED DEEP AND STRANGE
THE BIZARRE SECRET OF THEIR FUMBLING SPEECH
THEIR LINKS WITH UNDERLYING REALITY
THE UNSEEN GREW VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE
THOUGHTS LEAPED DOWN FROM A SUPERCONSCIENT FIELD
LIKE EAGLES SWOOPING FROM A VIEWLESS PEAK
THOUGHTS GLEAMED UP FROM THE SCREENED SUBLIMINAL DEPTHS
LIKE GOLDEN FISHES FROM A HIDDEN SEA
THIS WORLD IS A VAST UNBROKEN TOTALITY
A DEEP SOLIDARITY JOINS ITS CONTRARY POWERS
GOD'S SUMMITS LOOK BACK ON THE MUTE ABYSS
SO MAN EVOLVING TO DIVINEST HEIGHTS
COLLOQUES STILL WITH THE ANIMAL AND THE DJINN
THE HUMAN GODHEAD WITH STAR-GAZER EYES
LIVES STILL IN ONE HOUSE WITH THE PRIMAL BEAST
THE HIGH MEETS THE LOW ALL IS A SINGLE PLAN
SO SHE BEHELD THE MANY BIRTHS OF THOUGHT
IF BIRTHS CAN BE OF WHAT ETERNAL IS
FOR THE ETERNAL'S POWERS ARE LIKE HIMSELF
TIMELESS IN THE TIMELESS IN TIME EVER BORN
THIS TOO SHE SAW THAT ALL IN OUTER MIND
IS MADE NOT BORN A PRODUCT PERISHABLE
FORGED IN THE BODY'S FACTORY BY EARTH-FORCE
THIS MIND IS A DYNAMIC SMALL MACHINE
PRODUCING CEASELESSLY TILL IT WEARS OUT
542
WITH RAW MATERIAL DRAWN FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD
THE PATTERNS SKETCHED OUT BY AN ARTIST GOD
OFTEN OUR THOUGHTS ARE FINISHED COSMIC WARES
ADMITTED BY A SILENT OFFICE GATE
AND PASSED THROUGH THE SUBCONSCIENT'S GALLERIES
THEN ISSUED IN TIME'S MART AS PRIVATE MAKE
FOR NOW THEY BEAR THE LIVING PERSON'S STAMP
A TRICK A SPECIAL HUE CLAIMS THEM HIS OWN
ALL ELSE IS NATURE'S CRAFT AND THIS TOO HERS
OUR TASKS ARE GIVEN WE ARE BUT INSTRUMENTS
NOTHING IS ALL OUR OWN THAT WE CREATE
THE POWER THAT ACTS IN US IS NOT OUR FORCE
THE GENIUS TOO RECEIVES FROM SOME HIGH FOUNT
CONCEALED IN A SUPERNAL SECRECY
THE WORK THAT GIVES HIM AN IMMORTAL NAME
THE WORD THE FORM THE CHARM THE GLORY AND GRACE
ARE MISSIONED SPARKS FROM A STUPENDOUS FIRE
A SAMPLE FROM THE LABORATORY OF GOD
OF WHICH HE HOLDS THE PATENT UPON EARTH
COMES TO HIM WRAPPED IN GOLDEN COVERINGS
HE LISTENS FOR INSPIRATION'S POSTMAN KNOCK
AND TAKES DELIVERY OF THE PRICELESS GIFT
A LITTLE SPOILT BY THE RECEIVER MIND
OR MIXED WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS BRAIN
WHEN LEAST DEFACED THEN IS IT MOST DIVINE
ALTHOUGH HIS EGO CLAIMS THE WORLD FOR ITS USE
MAN IS A DYNAMO FOR THE COSMIC WORK
NATURE DOES MOST IN HIM GOD THE HIGH REST
ONLY HIS SOUL'S ACCEPTANCE IS HIS OWN
THIS INDEPENDENT ONCE A POWER SUPREME
SELF-BORN BEFORE THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE
ACCEPTING COSMOS BINDS HIMSELF NATURE'S SERF
TILL HE BECOMES HER FREEDMAN OR GOD'S SLAVE
THIS IS THE APPEARANCE IN OUR MORTAL FRONT
OUR GREATER TRUTH OF BEING LIES BEHIND
OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS COSMIC AND IMMENSE
543
BUT ONLY WHEN WE BREAK THROUGH MATTER'S WALL
IN THAT SPIRITUAL VASTNESS CAN WE STAND
WHERE WE CAN LIVE THE MASTERS OF OUR WORLD
AND MIND IS ONLY A MEANS AND BODY A TOOL
FOR ABOVE THE BIRTH OF BODY AND OF THOUGHT
OUR SPIRIT'S TRUTH LIVES IN THE NAKED SELF
AND FROM THAT HEIGHT UNBOUND SURVEYS THE WORLD
OUT OF THE MIND SHE ROSE TO ESCAPE ITS LAW
THAT IT MIGHT SLEEP IN SOME DEEP SHADOW OF SELF
OR FALL SILENT IN THE SILENCE OF THE UNSEEN
HIGH SHE ATTAINED AND STOOD FROM NATURE FREE
AND SAW CREATION'S LIFE FROM FAR ABOVE
THENCE UPON ALL SHE LAID HER SOVEREIGN WILL
TO DEDICATE IT TO GOD'S TIMELESS CALM
THEN ALL GREW TRANQUIL IN HER BEING'S SPACE
ONLY SOMETIMES SMALL THOUGHTS AROSE AND FELL
LIKE QUIET WAVES UPON A SILENT SEA
OR RIPPLES PASSING OVER A LONELY POOL
WHEN A STRAY STONE DISTURBS ITS DREAMING REST
YET THE MIND'S FACTORY HAD CEASED TO WORK
THERE WAS NO SOUND OF THE DYNAMO'S THROB
THERE CAME NO CALL FROM THE STILL FIELDS OF LIFE
THEN EVEN THOSE STIRRINGS ROSE IN HER NO MORE
HER MIND NOW SEEMED LIKE A VAST EMPTY ROOM
OR LIKE A PEACEFUL LANDSCAPE WITHOUT SOUND
THIS MEN CALL QUIETUDE AND PRIZE AS PEACE
BUT TO HER DEEPER SIGHT ALL YET WAS THERE
EFFERVESCING LIKE A CHAOS UNDER A LID
FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS CRIED OUT FOR WORD AND ACT
BUT FOUND NO RESPONSE IN THE SILENCED BRAIN
ALL WAS SUPPRESSED BUT NOTHING YET EXPUNGED
AT EVERY MOMENT MIGHT EXPLOSION COME
THEN THIS TOO PAUSED THE BODY SEEMED A STONE
ALL NOW WAS A WIDE MIGHTY VACANCY
BUT STILL EXCLUDED FROM ETERNITY'S HUSH
FOR STILL WAS FAR THE REPOSE OF THE ABSOLUTE
544
AND THE OCEAN SILENCE OF INFINITY
EVEN NOW SOME THOUGHTS COULD CROSS HER SOLITUDE
THESE SURGED NOT FROM THE DEPTHS OR FROM WITHIN
CAST UP FROM FORMLESSNESS TO SEEK A FORM
SPOKE NOT THE BODY'S NEED NOR VOICED LIFE'S CALL
THESE SEEMED NOT BORN NOR MADE IN HUMAN TIME
CHILDREN OF COSMIC NATURE FROM A FAR WORLD
IDEA'S SHAPES IN COMPLETE ARMOUR OF WORDS
POSTED LIKE TRAVELLERS IN AN ALIEN SPACE
OUT OF SOME FAR EXPANSE THEY SEEMED TO COME
AS IF CARRIED ON VAST WINGS LIKE LARGE WHITE SAILS
AND WITH EASY ACCESS REACHED THE INNER EAR
AS THOUGH THEY USED A NATURAL PRIVILEGED RIGHT
TO THE HIGH ROYAL ENTRIES OF THE SOUL
AS YET THEIR PATH LAY DEEP-CONCEALED IN LIGHT
THEN LOOKING TO KNOW WHENCE THE INTRUDERS CAME
SHE SAW A SPIRITUAL IMMENSITY
PERVADING AND ENCOMPASSING THE WORLD-SPACE
AS ETHER OUR TRANSPARENT TANGIBLE AIR
AND THROUGH IT SAILING TRANQUILLY A THOUGHT
AS SMOOTHLY GLIDES A SHIP NEARING ITS PORT
IGNORANT OF EMBARGO AND BLOCKADE
CONFIDENT OF ENTRANCE AND THE VISA'S SEAL
IT CAME TO THE SILENT CITY OF THE BRAIN
TOWARDS ITS ACCUSTOMED AND EXPECTANT QUAY
BUT MET A BARRING WILL A BLOW OF FORCE
AND SANK VANISHING IN THE IMMENSITY
AFTER A LONG VACANT PAUSE ANOTHER APPEARED
AND OTHERS ONE BY ONE SUDDENLY EMERGED
MIND'S UNEXPECTED VISITORS FROM THE UNSEEN
LIKE FAR-OFF SAILS UPON A LONELY SEA
BUT SOON THAT COMMERCE FAILED NONE REACHED MIND'S COAST
THEN ALL GREW STILL NOTHING MOVED ANY MORE
IMMOBILE SELF-RAPT TIMELESS SOLITARY
A SILENT SPIRIT PERVADED SILENT SPACE
545
IN THAT ABSOLUTE STILLNESS BARE AND FORMIDABLE
THERE WAS GLIMPSED AN ALL-NEGATING VOID SUPREME
THAT CLAIMED ITS MYSTIC NIHIL'S SOVEREIGN RIGHT
TO CANCEL NATURE AND DENY THE SOUL
EVEN THE NUDE SENSE OF SELF GREW PALE AND THIN
IMPERSONAL SIGNLESS FEATURELESS VOID OF FORMS
A BLANK PURE CONSCIOUSNESS HAD REPLACED THE MIND
HER SPIRIT SEEMED THE SUBSTANCE OF A NAME
THE WORLD A PICTURED SYMBOL DRAWN ON SELF
A DREAM OF IMAGES A DREAM OF SOUNDS
BUILT UP THE SEMBLANCE OF A UNIVERSE
OR LENT TO SPIRIT THE APPEARANCE OF A WORLD
THIS WAS SELF-SEEING IN THAT INTOLERANT HUSH
NO NOTION AND NO CONCEPT COULD TAKE SHAPE
THERE WAS NO SENSE TO FRAME THE FIGURE OF THINGS
A SHEER SELF-SIGHT WAS THERE NO THOUGHT AROSE
EMOTION SLEPT DEEP DOWN IN THE STILL HEART
OR LAY BURIED IN A CEMETERY OF PEACE
ALL FEELINGS SEEMED QUIESCENT CALM OR DEAD
AS IF THE HEART-STRINGS RENT COULD WORK NO MORE
AND JOY AND GRIEF COULD NEVER RISE AGAIN
THE HEART BEAT ON WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS RHYTHM
BUT NO RESPONSE CAME FROM IT AND NO CRY
VAIN WAS THE PROVOCATION OF EVENTS
NOTHING WITHIN ANSWERED AN OUTSIDE TOUCH
NO NERVE WAS STIRRED AND NO REACTION ROSE
YET STILL HER BODY SAW AND MOVED AND SPOKE
IT UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT THE AID OF THOUGHT
IT SAID WHATEVER NEEDED TO BE SAID
IT DID WHATEVER NEEDED TO BE DONE
THERE WAS NO PERSON THERE BEHIND THE ACT
NO MIND THAT CHOSE OR PASSED THE FITTING WORD
ALL WROUGHT LIKE AN UNERRING APT MACHINE
AS IF CONTINUING OLD HABITUAL TURNS
AND PUSHED BY AN OLD UNEXHAUSTED FORCE
THE ENGINE DID THE WORK FOR WHICH IT WAS MADE
546
HER CONSCIOUSNESS LOOKED ON AND TOOK NO PART
ALL IT UPHELD IN NOTHING HAD A SHARE
THERE WAS NO STRONG INITIATOR WILL
AN INCOHERENCE CROSSING A FIRM VOID
SLIPPED INTO AN ORDER OF RELATED CHANCE
A PURE PERCEPTION WAS THE ONLY POWER
THAT STOOD BEHIND HER ACTION AND HER SIGHT
IF THAT RETIRED ALL OBJECTS WOULD BE EXTINCT
HER PRIVATE UNIVERSE WOULD CEASE TO BE
THE HOUSE SHE HAD BUILT WITH BRICKS OF THOUGHT AND SENSE
IN THE BEGINNING AFTER THE BIRTH OF SPACE
THIS SEEING WAS IDENTICAL WITH THE SEEN
IT KNEW WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE ALL THAT COULD BE KNOWN
IT SAW IMPARTIALLY THE WORLD GO BY
BUT IN THE SAME SUPINE UNMOVING GLANCE
SAW TOO ITS ABYSMAL UNREALITY
IT WATCHED THE FIGURE OF THE COSMIC GAME
BUT THE THOUGHT AND INNER LIFE IN FORMS SEEMED DEAD
ABOLISHED BY HER OWN COLLAPSE OF THOUGHT
A HOLLOW PHYSICAL SHELL PERSISTED STILL
ALL SEEMED A BRILLIANT SHADOW OF ITSELF
A COSMIC FILM OF SCENES AND IMAGES
THE ENDURING MASS AND OUTLINE OF THE HILLS
WAS A DESIGN SKETCHED ON A SILENT MIND
AND HELD TO A TREMULOUS FALSE SOLIDITY
BY CONSTANT BEATS OF VISIONARY SIGHT
THE FOREST WITH ITS EMERALD MULTITUDES
CLOTHED WITH ITS SHOW OF HUES VAGUE EMPTY SPACE
A PAINTING'S COLOURS HIDING A SURFACE VOID
THAT FLICKERED UPON DISSOLUTION'S EDGE
THE BLUE HEAVENS AN ILLUSION OF THE EYES
ROOFED IN THE MIND'S ILLUSION OF A WORLD
THE MEN WHO WALKED BENEATH AN UNREAL SKY
SEEMED MOBILE PUPPETS OUT OF CARDBOARD CUT
AND PUSHED BY UNSEEN HANDS ACROSS THE SOIL
OR MOVING PICTURES UPON FANCY'S FILM
547
THERE WAS NO SOUL WITHIN NO POWER OF LIFE
THE BRAIN'S VIBRATIONS THAT APPEAR LIKE THOUGHT
THE NERVE'S BRIEF ANSWER TO EACH CONTACT'S KNOCK
THE HEART'S QUIVERINGS FELT AS JOY AND GRIEF AND LOVE
WERE TWITCHINGS OF THE BODY THEIR SEEMING SELF
THAT BODY FORGED FROM ATOMS AND FROM GAS
A MANUFACTURED LIE OF MAYA'S MAKE
ITS LIFE A DREAM SEEN BY THE SLEEPING VOID
THE ANIMALS LONE OR TROOPING THROUGH THE GLADES
FLED LIKE A PASSING VISION OF BEAUTY AND GRACE
IMAGINED BY SOME ALL-CREATING EYE
YET SOMETHING WAS THERE BEHIND THE FADING SCENE
WHEREVER SHE TURNED AT WHATSOEVER SHE LOOKED
IT WAS PERCEIVED YET HID FROM MIND AND SIGHT
THE ONE ONLY REAL SHUT ITSELF FROM SPACE
AND STOOD ALOOF FROM THE IDEA OF TIME
ITS TRUTH ESCAPED FROM SHAPE AND LINE AND HUE
ALL ELSE GREW UNSUBSTANTIAL SELF-ANNULLED
THIS ONLY EVERLASTING SEEMED AND TRUE
YET NOWHERE DWELT IT WAS OUTSIDE THE HOURS
THIS ONLY COULD JUSTIFY THE LABOUR OF SIGHT
BUT SIGHT COULD NOT DEFINE FOR IT A FORM
THIS ONLY COULD APPEASE THE UNSATISFIED EAR
BUT HEARING LISTENED IN VAIN FOR A MISSING SOUND
THIS ANSWERED NOT THE SENSE CALLED NOT TO MIND
IT MET HER AS THE UNCAUGHT INAUDIBLE VOICE
THAT SPEAKS FOR EVER FROM THE UNKNOWABLE
IT MET HER LIKE AN OMNIPRESENT POINT
PURE OF DIMENSIONS UNFIXED INVISIBLE
THE SINGLE ONENESS OF ITS MULTIPLIED BEAT
ACCENTUATING ITS SOLE ETERNITY
IT FACED HER AS SOME VAST NOUGHT'S IMMENSITY
AN ENDLESS NO TO ALL THAT SEEMS TO BE
AN ENDLESS YES TO THINGS EVER UNCONCEIVED
AND ALL THAT IS UNIMAGINED AND UNTHOUGHT
AN ETERNAL ZERO OR UNTOTALLED AUGHT
548
A SPACELESS AND A PLACELESS INFINITE
YET ETERNITY AND INFINITY SEEMED BUT WORDS
VAINLY AFFIXED BY MIND'S INCOMPETENCE
TO ITS STUPENDOUS LONE REALITY
THE WORLD IS BUT A SPARK-BURST FROM ITS LIGHT
ALL MOMENTS FLASHES FROM ITS TIMELESSNESS
ALL OBJECTS GLIMMERINGS OF THE BODILESS
THAT DISAPPEAR FROM MIND WHEN THAT IS SEEN
IT HELD AS IF A SHIELD BEFORE ITS FACE
A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SAW WITHOUT A SEER
THE TRUTH WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS NOT NOR KNOWER NOR KNOWN
THE LOVE ENAMOURED OF ITS OWN DELIGHT
IN WHICH THE LOVER IS NOT NOR THE BELOVED
BRINGING THEIR PERSONAL PASSION INTO THE VAST
THE FORCE OMNIPOTENT IN QUIETUDE
THE BLISS THAT NONE CAN EVER HOPE TO TASTE
IT CANCELLED THE CONVINCING CHEAT OF SELF
A TRUTH IN NOTHINGNESS WAS ITS MIGHTY CLUE
IF ALL EXISTENCE COULD RENOUNCE TO BE
AND BEING TAKE REFUGE IN NON-BEING'S ARMS
AND NON-BEING COULD STRIKE OUT ITS CIPHERED ROUND
SOME LUSTRE OF THAT REALITY MIGHT APPEAR
A FORMLESS LIBERATION CAME ON HER
ONCE SEPULCHRED ALIVE IN BRAIN AND FLESH
SHE HAD RISEN UP FROM BODY MIND AND LIFE
SHE WAS NO MORE A PERSON IN A WORLD
SHE HAD ESCAPED INTO INFINITY
WHAT ONCE HAD BEEN HERSELF HAD DISAPPEARED
THERE WAS NO FRAME OF THINGS NO FIGURE OF SOUL
A REFUGEE FROM THE DOMAIN OF SENSE
EVADING THE NECESSITY OF THOUGHT
DELIVERED FROM KNOWLEDGE AND FROM IGNORANCE
AND RESCUED FROM THE TRUE AND THE UNTRUE
SHE SHARED THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S HIGH RETREAT
BEYOND THE SELF-BORN WORD THE NUDE IDEA
THE FIRST BARE SOLID GROUND OF CONSCIOUSNESS
549
BEINGS WERE NOT THERE EXISTENCE HAD NO PLACE
THERE WAS NO TEMPTATION OF THE JOY TO BE
UNUTTERABLY EFFACED NO ONE AND NULL
A VANISHING VESTIGE LIKE A VIOLET TRACE
A FAINT RECORD MERELY OF A SELF NOW PAST
SHE WAS A POINT IN THE UNKNOWABLE
ONLY SOME LAST ANNULMENT NOW REMAINED
ANNIHILATION'S VAGUE INDEFINABLE STEP
A MEMORY OF BEING STILL WAS THERE
AND KEPT HER SEPARATE FROM NOTHINGNESS
SHE WAS IN THAT BUT STILL BECAME NOT THAT
THIS SHADOW OF HERSELF SO CLOSE TO NOUGHT
COULD BE AGAIN SELF'S POINT D'APPUI TO LIVE
RETURN OUT OF THE INCONCEIVABLE
AND BE WHAT SOME MYSTERIOUS VAST MIGHT CHOOSE
EVEN AS THE UNKNOWABLE DECREED
SHE MIGHT BE NOUGHT OR NEW-BECOME THE ALL
OR IF THE OMNIPOTENT NIHIL TOOK A SHAPE
EMERGE AS SOMEONE AND REDEEM THE WORLD
EVEN SHE MIGHT LEARN WHAT THE MYSTIC CIPHER HELD
THIS SEEMING EXIT OR CLOSED END OF ALL
COULD BE A BLIND TENEBROUS PASSAGE SCREENED FROM SIGHT
HER STATE THE ECLIPSING SHELL OF A DARKENED SUN
ON ITS SECRET WAY TO THE INEFFABLE
EVEN NOW HER SPLENDID BEING MIGHT FLAME BACK
OUT OF THE SILENCE AND THE NULLITY
A GLEAMING PORTION OF THE ALL-WONDERFUL
A POWER OF SOME ALL-AFFIRMING ABSOLUTE
A SHINING MIRROR OF THE ETERNAL TRUTH
TO SHOW TO THE ONE-IN-ALL ITS MANIFEST FACE
TO THE SOULS OF MEN THEIR DEEP IDENTITY
OR SHE MIGHT WAKE INTO GOD'S QUIETUDE
BEYOND THE COSMIC DAY AND COSMIC NIGHT
AND REST APPEASED IN HIS WHITE ETERNITY
BUT THIS WAS NOW UNREAL OR REMOTE
OR COVERED IN THE MYSTIC FATHOMLESS BLANK
550
IN INFINITE NOTHINGNESS WAS THE ULTIMATE SIGN
OR ELSE THE REAL WAS THE UNKNOWABLE
A LONELY ABSOLUTE NEGATED ALL
IT EFFACED THE IGNORANT WORLD FROM ITS SOLITUDE
AND DROWNED THE SOUL IN ITS EVERLASTING PEACE
551
IN THE LITTLE HERMITAGE IN THE FOREST'S HEART
IN THE SUNLIGHT AND THE MOONLIGHT AND THE DARK
THE DAILY HUMAN LIFE WENT PLODDING ON
EVEN AS BEFORE WITH ITS SMALL UNCHANGING WORKS
AND ITS SPARE OUTWARD BODY OF ROUTINE
AND HAPPY QUIET OF ASCETIC PEACE
THE OLD BEAUTY SMILED OF THE TERRESTRIAL SCENE
SHE TOO WAS HER OLD GRACIOUS SELF TO MEN
THE ANCIENT MOTHER CLUTCHED HER CHILD TO HER BREAST
PRESSING HER CLOSE IN HER ENVIRONING ARMS
AS IF EARTH EVER THE SAME COULD FOR EVER KEEP
THE LIVING SPIRIT AND BODY IN HER CLASP
AS IF DEATH WERE NOT THERE NOR END NOR CHANGE
ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO READ OUTWARD SIGNS
NONE SAW AUGHT NEW IN HER NONE DIVINED HER STATE
THEY SAW A PERSON WHERE WAS ONLY GOD'S VAST
A STILL BEING OR A MIGHTY NOTHINGNESS
TO ALL SHE WAS THE SAME PERFECT SAVITRI
A GREATNESS AND A SWEETNESS AND A LIGHT
POURED OUT FROM HER UPON HER LITTLE WORLD
LIFE SHOWED TO ALL THE SAME FAMILIAR FACE
HER ACTS FOLLOWED THE OLD UNALTERED ROUND
SHE SPOKE THE WORDS THAT SHE WAS WONT TO SPEAK
AND DID THE THINGS THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS DONE
HER EYES LOOKED OUT ON EARTH'S UNCHANGING FACE
AROUND HER SOUL'S MUTENESS ALL MOVED AS OF OLD
A VACANT CONSCIOUSNESS WATCHED FROM WITHIN
EMPTY OF ALL BUT BARE REALITY
THERE WAS NO WILL BEHIND THE WORD AND ACT
NO THOUGHT FORMED IN HER BRAIN TO GUIDE THE SPEECH
552
AN IMPERSONAL EMPTINESS WALKED AND SPOKE IN HER
SOMETHING PERHAPS UNFELT UNSEEN UNKNOWN
GUARDED THE BODY FOR ITS FUTURE WORK
OR NATURE MOVED IN HER OLD STREAM OF FORCE
PERHAPS SHE BORE MADE CONSCIOUS IN HER BREAST
THE MIRACULOUS NIHIL ORIGIN OF OUR SOULS
AND SOURCE AND SUM OF THE VAST WORLD'S EVENTS
THE WOMB AND GRAVE OF THOUGHT A CIPHER OF GOD
A ZERO CIRCLE OF BEING'S TOTALITY
IT USED HER SPEECH AND ACTED IN HER ACTS
IT WAS BEAUTY IN HER LIMBS LIFE IN HER BREATH
THE ORIGINAL MYSTERY WORE HER HUMAN FACE
THUS WAS SHE LOST WITHIN TO SEPARATE SELF
HER MORTAL EGO PERISHED IN GOD'S NIGHT
ONLY A BODY WAS LEFT THE EGO'S SHELL
AFLOAT MID DRIFT AND FOAM OF THE WORLD-SEA
A SEA OF DREAM WATCHED BY A MOTIONLESS SENSE
IN A FIGURE OF UNREAL REALITY
AN IMPERSONAL FORESIGHT COULD ALREADY SEE
IN THE UNTHINKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPIRIT
EVEN NOW IT SEEMED NIGH DONE INEVITABLE
THE INDIVIDUAL DIE THE COSMOS PASS
THESE GONE THE TRANSCENDENTAL GREW A MYTH
THE HOLY GHOST WITHOUT THE FATHER AND SON
OR A SUBSTRATUM OF WHAT ONCE HAD BEEN
BEING THAT NEVER WILLED TO BEAR A WORLD
RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL LONELINESS
IMPASSIVE SOLE SILENT INTANGIBLE
YET ALL WAS NOT EXTINCT IN THIS DEEP LOSS
THE BEING TRAVELLED NOT TOWARDS NOTHINGNESS
THERE WAS SOME HIGH SURPASSING SECRECY
AND WHEN SHE SAT ALONE WITH SATYAVAN
HER MOVELESS MIND WITH HIS THAT SEARCHED AND STROVE
IN THE HUSH OF THE PROFOUND AND INTIMATE NIGHT
SHE TURNED TO THE FACE OF A VEILED VOICELESS TRUTH
HID IN THE DUMB RECESSES OF THE HEART
553
OR WAITING BEYOND THE LAST PEAK CLIMBED BY THOUGHT
UNSEEN ITSELF IT SEES THE STRUGGLING WORLD
AND PROMPTS OUR QUEST BUT CARES NOT TO BE FOUND
OUT OF THAT DISTANT VAST CAME A REPLY
SOMETHING UNKNOWN UNREACHED INSCRUTABLE
SENT DOWN THE MESSAGES OF ITS BODILESS LIGHT
CAST LIGHTNING FLASHES OF A THOUGHT NOT OURS
CROSSING THE IMMOBILE SILENCE OF HER MIND
IN ITS MIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBLE SOVEREIGNTY
IT SEIZED ON SPEECH TO GIVE THOSE FLAMINGS SHAPE
MADE BEAT THE HEART OF WISDOM IN A WORD
AND SPOKE IMMORTAL THINGS THROUGH MORTAL LIPS
OR LISTENING TO THE SAGES OF THE WOODS
IN QUESTION AND IN ANSWER BROKE FROM HER
HIGH STRANGE REVEALINGS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEN
SOMETHING OR SOMEONE SECRET AND REMOTE
TOOK HOLD OF HER BODY FOR HIS MYSTIC USE
HER MOUTH WAS SEIZED TO CHANNEL INEFFABLE TRUTHS
KNOWLEDGE UNTHINKABLE FOUND AN UTTERANCE
ASTONISHED BY A NEW ENLIGHTENMENT
INVADED BY A STREAK OF THE ABSOLUTE
THEY MARVELLED AT HER FOR SHE SEEMED TO KNOW
WHAT THEY HAD ONLY GLIMPSED AT TIMES AFAR
THESE THOUGHTS WERE FORMED NOT IN HER LISTENING BRAIN
HER VACANT HEART WAS LIKE A STRINGLESS HARP
IMPASSIVE THE BODY CLAIMED NOT ITS OWN VOICE
BUT LET THE LUMINOUS GREATNESS THROUGH IT PASS
A DUAL POWER AT BEING'S OCCULT POLES
STILL ACTED NAMELESS AND INVISIBLE
HER DIVINE EMPTINESS WAS THEIR INSTRUMENT
INCONSCIENT NATURE DEALT WITH THE WORLD IT HAD MADE
AND USING STILL THE BODY'S INSTRUMENTS
SLIPPED THROUGH THE CONSCIOUS VOID SHE HAD BECOME
THE SUPERCONSCIENT MYSTERY THROUGH THAT VOID
MISSIONED ITS WORD TO TOUCH THE THOUGHTS OF MEN
AS YET THIS GREAT IMPERSONAL SPEECH WAS RARE
554
BUT NOW THE UNMOVING WIDE SPIRITUAL SPACE
IN WHICH HER MIND SURVIVED TRANQUIL AND BARE
ADMITTED A TRAVELLER FROM THE COSMIC BREADTHS
A THOUGHT CAME THROUGH DRAPED AS AN OUTER VOICE
IT CALLED NOT FOR THE WITNESS OF THE MIND
IT SPOKE NOT TO THE HUSHED RECEIVING HEART
IT CAME DIRECT TO THE PURE PERCEPTION'S SEAT
AN ONLY CENTRE NOW OF CONSCIOUSNESS
IF CENTRE COULD BE WHERE ALL SEEMED ONLY SPACE
NO MORE SHUT IN BY BODY'S WALLS AND GATES
HER BEING A CIRCLE WITHOUT CIRCUMFERENCE
ALREADY NOW SURPASSED ALL COSMIC BOUNDS
AND MORE AND MORE SPREAD INTO INFINITY
THIS BEING WAS ITS OWN UNBOUNDED WORLD
A WORLD WITHOUT FORM OR FEATURE OR CIRCUMSTANCE
IT HAD NO GROUND NO WALL NO ROOF OF THOUGHT
YET SAW ITSELF AND LOOKED ON ALL AROUND
IN A SILENCE MOTIONLESS AND ILLIMITABLE
THERE WAS NO PERSON THERE NO CENTRED MIND
NO SEAT OF FEELING ON WHICH BEAT EVENTS
OR OBJECTS WROUGHT AND SHAPED REACTION'S STRESS
THERE WAS NO MOTION IN THIS INNER WORLD
ALL WAS A STILL AND EVEN INFINITY
IN HER THE UNSEEN THE UNKNOWN WAITED HIS HOUR
BUT NOW SHE SAT BY SLEEPING SATYAVAN
AWAKE WITHIN AND THE ENORMOUS NIGHT
SURROUNDED HER WITH THE UNKNOWABLE'S VAST
A VOICE BEGAN TO SPEAK FROM HER OWN HEART
THAT WAS NOT HERS YET MASTERED THOUGHT AND SENSE
AS IT SPOKE ALL CHANGED WITHIN HER AND WITHOUT
ALL WAS ALL LIVED SHE FELT ALL BEING ONE
THE WORLD OF UNREALITY CEASED TO BE
THERE WAS NO MORE A UNIVERSE BUILT BY MIND
CONVICTED AS A STRUCTURE OR A SIGN
A SPIRIT A BEING SAW CREATED THINGS
555
AND CAST ITSELF INTO UNNUMBERED FORMS
AND WAS WHAT IT SAW AND MADE ALL NOW BECAME
AN EVIDENCE OF ONE STUPENDOUS TRUTH
A TRUTH IN WHICH NEGATION HAD NO PLACE
A BEING AND A LIVING CONSCIOUSNESS
A STARK AND ABSOLUTE REALITY
THERE THE UNREAL COULD NOT FIND A PLACE
THE SENSE OF UNREALITY WAS SLAIN
THERE ALL WAS CONSCIOUS MADE OF THE INFINITE
ALL HAD A SUBSTANCE OF ETERNITY
YET THIS WAS THE SAME INDECIPHERABLE
IT SEEMED TO CAST FROM IT UNIVERSE LIKE A DREAM
VANISHING FOR EVER INTO AN ORIGINAL VOID
BUT THIS WAS NO MORE SOME VAGUE UBIQUITOUS POINT
OR A CIPHER OF VASTNESS IN UNREAL NOUGHT
IT WAS THE SAME BUT NOW NO MORE SEEMED FAR
TO THE LIVING CLASP OF HER RECOVERED SOUL
IT WAS HER SELF IT WAS THE SELF OF ALL
IT WAS THE REALITY OF EXISTING THINGS
IT WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT LIVED
AND FELT AND SAW IT WAS TIMELESSNESS AND TIME
IT WAS THE BLISS OF FORMLESSNESS AND FORM
IT WAS ALL LOVE AND THE ONE BELOVED'S ARMS
IT WAS SIGHT AND THOUGHT IN ONE ALL-SEEING MIND
IT WAS JOY OF BEING ON THE PEAKS OF GOD
SHE PASSED BEYOND TIME INTO ETERNITY
SLIPPED OUT OF SPACE AND BECAME THE INFINITE
HER BEING ROSE INTO UNREACHABLE HEIGHTS
AND FOUND NO END OF ITS JOURNEY IN THE SELF
IT PLUNGED INTO THE UNFATHOMABLE DEEPS
AND FOUND NO END TO THE SILENT MYSTERY
THAT HELD ALL WORLD WITHIN ONE LONELY BREAST
YET HARBOURED ALL CREATION'S MULTITUDES
SHE WAS ALL VASTNESS AND ONE MEASURELESS POINT
SHE WAS A HEIGHT BEYOND HEIGHTS A DEPTH BEYOND DEPTHS
SHE LIVED IN THE EVERLASTING AND WAS ALL
556
THAT HARBOURS DEATH AND BEARS THE WHEELING HOURS
ALL CONTRARIES WERE TRUE IN ONE HUGE SPIRIT
SURPASSING MEASURE CHANGE AND CIRCUMSTANCE
AN INDIVIDUAL ONE WITH COSMIC SELF
IN THE HEART OF THE TRANSCENDENT'S MIRACLE
AND THE SECRET OF WORLD-PERSONALITY
WAS THE CREATOR AND THE LORD OF ALL
MIND WAS A SINGLE INNUMERABLE LOOK
UPON HIMSELF AND ALL THAT HE BECAME
LIFE WAS HIS DRAMA AND THE VAST A STAGE
THE UNIVERSE WAS HIS BODY GOD ITS SOUL
ALL WAS ONE SINGLE IMMENSE REALITY
ALL ITS INNUMERABLE PHENOMENON
HER SPIRIT SAW THE WORLD AS LIVING GOD
IT SAW THE ONE AND KNEW THAT ALL WAS HE
SHE KNEW HIM AS THE ABSOLUTE'S SELF-SPACE
ONE WITH HER SELF AND GROUND OF ALL THINGS HERE
IN WHICH THE WORLD WANDERS SEEKING FOR THE TRUTH
GUARDED BEHIND ITS FACE OF IGNORANCE
SHE FOLLOWED HIM THROUGH THE MARCH OF ENDLESS TIME
ALL NATURE'S HAPPENINGS WERE EVENTS IN HER
THE HEART-BEATS OF THE COSMOS WERE HER OWN
ALL BEINGS THOUGHT AND FELT AND MOVED IN HER
SHE INHABITED THE VASTNESS OF THE WORLD
ITS DISTANCES WERE HER NATURE'S BOUNDARIES
ITS CLOSENESSES HER OWN LIFE'S INTIMACIES
HER MIND BECAME FAMILIAR WITH ITS MIND
ITS BODY WAS HER BODY'S LARGER FRAME
IN WHICH SHE LIVED AND KNEW HERSELF IN IT
ONE MULTITUDINOUS IN ITS MULTITUDES
SHE WAS A SINGLE BEING YET ALL THINGS
THE WORLD WAS HER SPIRIT'S WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE
THE THOUGHTS OF OTHERS WERE HER INTIMATES
THEIR FEELINGS CLOSE TO HER UNIVERSAL HEART
THEIR BODIES HER MANY BODIES KIN TO HER
SHE WAS NO MORE HERSELF BUT ALL THE WORLD
557
OUT OF THE INFINITUDES ALL CAME TO HER
INTO THE INFINITUDES SENTIENT SHE SPREAD
INFINITY WAS HER OWN NATURAL HOME
NOWHERE SHE DWELT HER SPIRIT WAS EVERYWHERE
THE DISTANT CONSTELLATIONS WHEELED ROUND HER
EARTH SAW HER BORN ALL WORLDS WERE HER COLONIES
THE GREATER WORLDS OF LIFE AND MIND WERE HERS
ALL NATURE REPRODUCED HER IN ITS LINES
ITS MOVEMENTS WERE LARGE COPIES OF HER OWN
SHE WAS THE SINGLE SELF OF ALL THESE SELVES
SHE WAS IN THEM AND THEY WERE ALL IN HER
THIS FIRST WAS AN IMMENSE IDENTITY
IN WHICH HER OWN IDENTITY WAS LOST
WHAT SEEMED HERSELF WAS AN IMAGE OF THE WHOLE
SHE WAS A SUBCONSCIENT LIFE OF TREE AND FLOWER
THE OUTBREAK OF THE HONIED BUDS OF SPRING
SHE BURNED IN THE PASSION AND SPLENDOUR OF THE ROSE
SHE WAS THE RED HEART OF THE PASSION-FLOWER
THE DREAM-WHITE OF THE LOTUS IN ITS POOL
OUT OF SUBCONSCIENT LIFE SHE CLIMBED TO MIND
SHE WAS THOUGHT AND THE PASSION OF THE WORLD'S HEART
SHE WAS THE GODHEAD HID IN THE HEART OF MAN
SHE WAS THE CLIMBING OF HIS SOUL TO GOD
THE COSMOS FLOWERED IN HER SHE WAS ITS BED
SHE WAS TIME AND THE DREAMS OF GOD IN TIME
SHE WAS SPACE AND THE WIDENESS OF HIS DAYS
FROM THIS SHE ROSE WHERE TIME AND SPACE WERE NOT
THE SUPERCONSCIENT WAS HER NATIVE AIR
INFINITY WAS HER MOVEMENT'S NATURAL SPACE
ETERNITY LOOKED OUT FROM HER ON TIME
561
NOW IT WAS HERE IN THIS GREAT GOLDEN DAWN
BY HER STILL SLEEPING HUSBAND LAIN SHE GAZED
INTO HER PAST AS ONE ABOUT TO DIE
LOOKS BACK UPON THE SUNLIT FIELDS OF LIFE
WHERE HE TOO RAN AND SPORTED WITH THE REST
LIFTING HIS HEAD ABOVE THE HUGE DARK STREAM
INTO WHOSE DEPTHS HE MUST FOR EVER PLUNGE
ALL SHE HAD BEEN AND DONE SHE LIVED AGAIN
THE WHOLE YEAR IN A SWIFT AND EDDYING RACE
OF MEMORIES SWEPT THROUGH HER AND FLED AWAY
INTO THE IRRECOVERABLE PAST
THEN SILENTLY SHE ROSE AND SERVICE DONE
BOWED DOWN TO THE GREAT GODDESS SIMPLY CARVED
BY SATYAVAN UPON A FOREST STONE
WHAT PRAYER SHE BREATHED HER SOUL AND DURGA KNEW
PERHAPS SHE FELT IN THE DIM FOREST HUGE
THE INFINITE MOTHER WATCHING OVER HER CHILD
PERHAPS THE SHROUDED VOICE SPOKE SOME STILL WORD
AT LAST SHE CAME TO THE PALE MOTHER QUEEN
SHE SPOKE BUT WITH GUARDED LIPS AND TRANQUIL FACE
LEST SOME STRAY WORD OR SOME BETRAYING LOOK
SHOULD LET PASS INTO THE MOTHER'S UNKNOWING BREAST
SLAYING ALL HAPPINESS AND NEED TO LIVE
A DIRE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF THE GRIEF TO COME
ONLY THE NEEDED UTTERANCE PASSAGE FOUND
ALL ELSE SHE PRESSED BACK INTO HER ANGUISHED HEART
AND FORCED UPON HER SPEECH AN OUTWARD PEACE
562
ONE YEAR THAT I HAVE LIVED WITH SATYAVAN
HERE ON THE EMERALD EDGE OF THE VAST WOODS
IN THE IRON RING OF THE ENORMOUS PEAKS
UNDER THE BLUE RIFTS OF THE FOREST SKY
I HAVE NOT GONE INTO THE SILENCES
OF THIS GREAT WOODLAND THAT ENRINGED MY THOUGHTS
WITH MYSTERY NOR IN ITS GREEN MIRACLES
WANDERED BUT THIS SMALL CLEARING WAS MY WORLD
NOW HAS A STRONG DESIRE SEIZED ALL MY HEART
TO GO WITH SATYAVAN HOLDING HIS HAND
INTO THE LIFE THAT HE HAS LOVED AND TOUCH
HERBS HE HAS TROD AND KNOW THE FOREST FLOWERS
AND HEAR AT EASE THE BIRDS AND THE SCURRYING LIFE
THAT STARTS AND CEASES RICH FAR RUSTLE OF BOUGHS
AND ALL THE MYSTIC WHISPERING OF THE WOODS
RELEASE ME NOW AND LET MY HEART HAVE REST
SHE ANSWERED DO AS THY WISE MIND DESIRES
O CALM CHILD-SOVEREIGN WITH THE EYES THAT RULE
I HOLD THEE FOR A STRONG GODDESS WHO HAS COME
PITYING OUR BARREN DAYS SO DOST THOU SERVE
EVEN AS A SLAVE MIGHT YET ART THOU BEYOND
ALL THAT THOU DOEST ALL OUR MINDS CONCEIVE
LIKE THE STRONG SUN THAT SERVES EARTH FROM ABOVE
THEN THE DOOMED HUSBAND AND THE WOMAN WHO KNEW
WENT WITH LINKED HANDS INTO THAT SOLEMN WORLD
WHERE BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR AND UNSPOKEN DREAM
WHERE NATURE'S MYSTIC SILENCE COULD BE FELT
COMMUNING WITH THE SECRECY OF GOD
BESIDE HER SATYAVAN WALKED FULL OF JOY
BECAUSE SHE MOVED WITH HIM THROUGH HIS GREEN HAUNTS
HE SHOWED HER ALL THE FOREST'S RICHES FLOWERS
INNUMERABLE OF EVERY ODOUR AND HUE
AND SOFT THICK CLINGING CREEPERS RED AND GREEN
AND STRANGE RICH-PLUMAGED BIRDS TO EVERY CRY
THAT HAUNTED SWEETLY DISTANT BOUGHS REPLIED
WITH THE SHRILL SINGER'S NAME MORE SWEETLY CALLED
563
HE SPOKE OF ALL THE THINGS HE LOVED THEY WERE
HIS BOYHOOD'S COMRADES AND HIS PLAYFELLOWS
COEVALS AND COMPANIONS OF HIS LIFE
HERE IN THIS WORLD WHOSE EVERY MOOD HE KNEW
THEIR THOUGHTS WHICH TO THE COMMON MIND ARE BLANK
HE SHARED TO EVERY WILD EMOTION FELT
AN ANSWER DEEPLY SHE LISTENED BUT TO HEAR
THE VOICE THAT SOON WOULD CEASE FROM TENDER WORDS
AND TREASURE ITS SWEET CADENCES BELOVED
FOR LONELY MEMORY WHEN NONE BY HER WALKED
AND THE BELOVED VOICE COULD SPEAK NO MORE
BUT LITTLE DWELT HER MIND UPON THEIR SENSE
OF DEATH NOT LIFE SHE THOUGHT OR LIFE'S LONE END
LOVE IN HER BOSOM HURT WITH THE JAGGED EDGES
OF ANGUISH MOANED AT EVERY STEP WITH PAIN
CRYING NOW NOW PERHAPS HIS VOICE WILL CEASE
FOR EVER EVEN BY SOME VAGUE TOUCH OPPRESSED
SOMETIMES HER EYES LOOKED ROUND AS IF THEIR ORBS
MIGHT SEE THE DIM AND DREADFUL GOD'S APPROACH
BUT SATYAVAN HAD PAUSED HE MEANT TO FINISH
HIS LABOUR HERE THAT HAPPY LINKED UNCARING
THEY TWO MIGHT WANDER FREE IN THE GREEN DEEP
PRIMAEVAL MYSTERY OF THE FOREST'S HEART
A TREE THAT RAISED ITS TRANQUIL HEAD TO HEAVEN
LUXURIATING IN VERDURE SUMMONING
THE BREEZE WITH AMOROUS WIDENESS OF ITS BOUGHS
HE CHOSE AND WITH HIS STEEL ASSAILED THE ARM
BROWN ROUGH AND STRONG HIDDEN IN ITS EMERALD DRESS
WORDLESS BUT NEAR SHE WATCHED NO TURN TO LOSE
OF THE BRIGHT FACE AND BODY WHICH SHE LOVED
HER LIFE WAS NOW IN SECONDS NOT IN HOURS
AND EVERY MOMENT SHE ECONOMISED
LIKE A PALE MERCHANT LEANED ABOVE HIS STORE
THE MISER OF HIS POOR REMAINING GOLD
BUT SATYAVAN WIELDED A JOYOUS AXE
HE SANG HIGH SNATCHES OF A SAGE'S CHANT
564
THAT PEALED OF CONQUERED DEATH AND DEMONS SLAIN
AND SOMETIMES PAUSED TO CRY TO HER SWEET SPEECH
OF LOVE AND MOCKERY TENDERER THAN LOVE
SHE LIKE A PANTHERESS LEAPED UPON HIS WORDS
AND CARRIED THEM INTO HER CAVERN HEART
BUT AS HE WORKED HIS DOOM UPON HIM CAME
THE VIOLENT AND HUNGRY HOUNDS OF PAIN
TRAVELLED THROUGH HIS BODY BITING AS THEY PASSED
SILENTLY AND ALL HIS SUFFERING BREATH BESIEGED
STROVE TO REND LIFE'S STRONG HEART-CORDS AND BE FREE
THEN HELPED AS IF A BEAST HAD LEFT ITS PREY
A MOMENT IN A WAVE OF RICH RELIEF
REBORN TO STRENGTH AND HAPPY EASE HE STOOD
REJOICING AND RESUMED HIS CONFIDENT TOIL
BUT WITH LESS SEEING STROKES NOW THE GREAT WOODSMAN
HEWED AT HIM AND HIS LABOUR CEASED LIFTING
HIS ARM HE FLUNG AWAY THE POIGNANT AXE
FAR FROM HIM LIKE AN INSTRUMENT OF PAIN
SHE CAME TO HIM IN SILENT ANGUISH AND CLASPED
AND HE CRIED TO HER SAVITRI A PANG
CLEAVES THROUGH MY HEAD AND BREAST AS IF THE AXE
WERE PIERCING IT AND NOT THE LIVING BRANCH
SUCH AGONY RENDS ME AS THE TREE MUST FEEL
WHEN IT IS SUNDERED AND MUST LOSE ITS LIFE
AWHILE LET ME LAY MY HEAD UPON THY LAP
AND GUARD ME WITH THY HANDS FROM EVIL FATE
PERHAPS BECAUSE THOU TOUCHEST DEATH MAY PASS
THEN SAVITRI SAT UNDER BRANCHES WIDE
COOL GREEN AGAINST THE SUN NOT THE HURT TREE
WHICH HIS KEEN AXE HAD CLOVEN THAT SHE SHUNNED
BUT LEANED BENEATH A FORTUNATE KINGLY TRUNK
SHE GUARDED HIM IN HER BOSOM AND STROVE TO SOOTHE
HIS ANGUISHED BROW AND BODY WITH HER HANDS
ALL GRIEF AND FEAR WERE DEAD WITHIN HER NOW
AND A GREAT CALM HAD FALLEN THE WISH TO LESSEN
HIS SUFFERING THE IMPULSE THAT OPPOSES PAIN
565
WERE THE ONE MORTAL FEELING LEFT IT PASSED
GRIEFLESS AND STRONG SHE WAITED LIKE THE GODS
BUT NOW HIS SWEET FAMILIAR HUE WAS CHANGED
INTO A TARNISHED GREYNESS AND HIS EYES
DIMMED OVER FORSAKEN OF THE CLEAR LIGHT SHE LOVED
ONLY THE DULL AND PHYSICAL MIND WAS LEFT
VACANT OF THE BRIGHT SPIRIT'S LUMINOUS GAZE
BUT ONCE BEFORE IT FADED WHOLLY BACK
HE CRIED OUT IN A CLINGING LAST DESPAIR
SAVITRI SAVITRI O SAVITRI
LEAN DOWN MY SOUL AND KISS ME WHILE I DIE
AND EVEN AS HER PALLID LIPS PRESSED HIS
HIS FAILED LOSING LAST SWEETNESS OF RESPONSE
HIS CHEEK PRESSED DOWN HER GOLDEN ARM SHE SOUGHT
HIS MOUTH STILL WITH HER LIVING MOUTH AS IF
SHE COULD PERSUADE HIS SOUL BACK WITH HER KISS
THEN GREW AWARE THEY WERE NO MORE ALONE
SOMETHING HAD COME THERE CONSCIOUS VAST AND DIRE
NEAR HER SHE FELT A SILENT SHADE IMMENSE
CHILLING THE NOON WITH DARKNESS FOR ITS BACK
AN AWFUL HUSH HAD FALLEN UPON THE PLACE
THERE WAS NO CRY OF BIRDS NO VOICE OF BEASTS
A TERROR AND AN ANGUISH FILLED THE WORLD
AS IF ANNIHILATION'S MYSTERY
HAD TAKEN A SENSIBLE FORM A COSMIC MIND
LOOKED OUT ON ALL FROM FORMIDABLE EYES
CONTEMNING ALL WITH ITS UNBEARABLE GAZE
AND WITH IMMORTAL LIDS AND A VAST BROW
IT SAW IN ITS IMMENSE DESTROYING THOUGHT
ALL THINGS AND BEINGS AS A PITIFUL DREAM
REJECTING WITH CALM DISDAIN NATURE'S DELIGHT
THE WORDLESS MEANING OF ITS DEEP REGARD
VOICING THE UNREALITY OF THINGS
AND LIFE THAT WOULD BE FOR EVER BUT NEVER WAS
AND ITS BRIEF AND VAIN RECURRENCE WITHOUT CEASE
AS IF FROM A SILENCE WITHOUT FORM OR NAME
566
THE SHADOW OF A REMOTE UNCARING GOD
DOOMED TO HIS NOUGHT THE ILLUSORY UNIVERSE
CANCELLING ITS SHOW OF IDEA AND ACT IN TIME
AND ITS IMITATION OF ETERNITY
SHE KNEW THAT VISIBLE DEATH WAS STANDING THERE
AND SATYAVAN HAD PASSED FROM HER EMBRACE
571
SO WAS SHE LEFT ALONE IN THE HUGE WOOD
SURROUNDED BY A DIM UNTHINKING WORLD
HER HUSBAND'S CORPSE ON HER FORSAKEN BREAST
IN HER VAST SILENT SPIRIT MOTIONLESS
SHE MEASURED NOT HER LOSS WITH HELPLESS THOUGHTS
NOR RENT WITH TEARS THE MARBLE SEALS OF PAIN
SHE ROSE NOT YET TO FACE THE DREADFUL GOD
OVER THE BODY SHE LOVED HER SOUL LEANED OUT
IN A GREAT STILLNESS WITHOUT STIR OR VOICE
AS IF HER MIND HAD DIED WITH SATYAVAN
BUT STILL THE HUMAN HEART IN HER BEAT ON
AWARE STILL OF HIS BEING NEAR TO HERS
CLOSELY SHE CLASPED TO HER THE MUTE LIFELESS FORM
AS THOUGH TO GUARD THE ONENESS THEY HAD BEEN
AND KEEP THE SPIRIT STILL WITHIN ITS FRAME
THEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME ON HER THE CHANGE
WHICH IN TREMENDOUS MOMENTS OF OUR LIVES
CAN OVERTAKE SOMETIMES THE HUMAN SOUL
AND HOLD IT UP TOWARDS ITS LUMINOUS SOURCE
THE VEIL IS TORN THE THINKER IS NO MORE
ONLY THE SPIRIT SEES AND ALL IS KNOWN
THEN A CALM POWER SEATED ABOVE OUR BROWS
IS SEEN UNSHAKEN BY OUR THOUGHTS AND DEEDS
ITS STILLNESS BEARS THE VOICES OF THE WORLD
IMMOBILE IT MOVES NATURE LOOKS ON LIFE
IT SHAPES IMMUTABLY ITS FAR-SEEN ENDS
UNTOUCHED AND TRANQUIL AMID ERROR AND TEARS
AND MEASURELESS ABOVE OUR STRIVING WILLS
ITS GAZE CONTROLS THE TURBULENT WHIRL OF THINGS
TO MATE WITH THE GLORY IT SEES THE SPIRIT GROWS
THE VOICE OF LIFE IS TUNED TO INFINITE SOUNDS
572
THE MOMENTS ON GREAT WINGS OF LIGHTNING COME
AND GODLIKE THOUGHTS SURPRISE THE MIND OF EARTH
INTO THE SOUL'S SPLENDOUR AND INTENSITY
A CRESCENT OF MIRACULOUS BIRTH IS TOSSED
WHOSE HORN OF MYSTERY FLOATS IN A BRIGHT VOID
AS INTO A HEAVEN OF STRENGTH AND SILENCE THOUGHT
IS RAVISHED ALL THIS LIVING MORTAL CLAY
IS SEIZED AND IN A SWIFT AND FIERY FLOOD
OF TOUCHES SHAPED BY A HARMONIST UNSEEN
A NEW SIGHT COMES NEW VOICES IN US FORM
A BODY OF THE MUSIC OF THE GODS
IMMORTAL YEARNINGS WITHOUT NAME LEAP DOWN
LARGE QUIVERINGS OF GODHEAD SEEKING RUN
AND WEAVE UPON A PUISSANT FIELD OF CALM
A HIGH AND LONELY ECSTASY OF WILL
THIS IN A MOMENT'S DEPTHS WAS BORN IN HER
NOW TO THE LIMITLESS GAZE DISCLOSED THAT SEES
THINGS BARRED FROM HUMAN THINKING'S EARTHLY LIDS
THE SPIRIT WHO HAD HIDDEN IN NATURE SOARED
OUT OF HIS LUMINOUS NEST WITHIN THE WORLDS
LIKE A VAST FIRE IT CLIMBED THE SKIES OF NIGHT
THUS WERE THE CORDS OF SELF-OBLIVION TORN
LIKE ONE WHO LOOKS UP TO FAR HEIGHTS SHE SAW
ANCIENT AND STRONG AS ON A WINDLESS SUMMIT
ABOVE HER WHERE SHE HAD WORKED IN HER LONE MIND
LABOURING APART IN A SOLE TOWER OF SELF
THE SOURCE OF ALL WHICH SHE HAD SEEMED OR WROUGHT
A POWER PROJECTED INTO COSMIC SPACE
A SLOW EMBODIMENT OF THE AEONIC WILL
A STARRY FRAGMENT OF THE ETERNAL TRUTH
THE PASSIONATE INSTRUMENT OF AN UNMOVED POWER
A PRESENCE WAS THERE THAT FILLED THE LISTENING WORLD
A CENTRAL ALL ASSUMED HER BOUNDLESS LIFE
A SOVEREIGNTY A SILENCE AND A SWIFTNESS
ONE BROODED OVER ABYSSES WHO WAS SHE
AS IN A CHORIC ROBE OF UNHEARD SOUNDS
573
A FORCE DESCENDED TRAILING ENDLESS LIGHTS
LINKING TIME'S SECONDS TO INFINITY
ILLIMITABLY IT GIRT THE EARTH AND HER
IT SANK INTO HER SOUL AND SHE WAS CHANGED
THEN LIKE A THOUGHT FULFILLED BY SOME GREAT WORD
THAT MIGHTINESS ASSUMED A SYMBOL FORM
HER BEING'S SPACES QUIVERED WITH ITS TOUCH
IT COVERED HER AS WITH IMMORTAL WINGS
ON ITS LIPS THE CURVE OF THE UNUTTERED TRUTH
A HALO OF WISDOM'S LIGHTNINGS FOR ITS CROWN
IT ENTERED THE MYSTIC LOTUS IN HER HEAD
A THOUSAND-PETALLED HOME OF POWER AND LIGHT
IMMORTAL LEADER OF HER MORTALITY
DOER OF HER WORKS AND FOUNTAIN OF HER WORDS
INVULNERABLE BY TIME OMNIPOTENT
IT STOOD ABOVE HER CALM IMMOBILE MUTE
ALL IN HER MATED WITH THAT MIGHTY HOUR
AS IF THE LAST REMNANT HAD BEEN SLAIN BY DEATH
OF THE HUMANITY THAT ONCE WAS HERS
ASSUMING A SPIRITUAL WIDE CONTROL
MAKING LIFE'S SEA A MIRROR OF HEAVEN'S SKY
THE YOUNG DIVINITY IN HER EARTHLY LIMBS
FILLED WITH CELESTIAL STRENGTH HER MORTAL PART
OVER WAS THE HAUNTED PAIN THE RENDING FEAR
HER GRIEF HAD PASSED AWAY HER MIND WAS STILL
HER HEART BEAT QUIETLY WITH A SOVEREIGN FORCE
THERE CAME A FREEDOM FROM THE HEART-STRINGS' CLUTCH
NOW ALL HER ACTS SPRANG FROM A GODHEAD'S CALM
CALMLY SHE LAID UPON THE FOREST SOIL
THE DEAD WHO STILL REPOSED UPON HER BREAST
AND BORE TO TURN AWAY FROM THE DEAD FORM
SOLE NOW SHE ROSE TO MEET THE DREADFUL GOD
THAT MIGHTIER SPIRIT TURNED ITS MASTERING GAZE
ON LIFE AND THINGS INHERITOR OF A WORK
LEFT TO IT UNFINISHED FROM HER HALTING PAST
574
WHEN YET THE MIND A PASSIONATE LEARNER TOILED
AND ILL-SHAPED INSTRUMENTS WERE CRUDELY MOVED
TRANSCENDED NOW WAS THE POOR HUMAN RULE
A SOVEREIGN POWER WAS THERE A GODLIKE WILL
A MOMENT YET SHE LINGERED MOTIONLESS
AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE DEAD MAN AT HER FEET
THEN LIKE A TREE RECOVERING FROM A WIND
SHE RAISED HER NOBLE HEAD FRONTING HER GAZE
SOMETHING STOOD THERE UNEARTHLY SOMBRE GRAND
A LIMITLESS DENIAL OF ALL BEING
THAT WORE THE TERROR AND WONDER OF A SHAPE
IN ITS APPALLING EYES THE TENEBROUS FORM
BORE THE DEEP PITY OF DESTROYING GODS
A SORROWFUL IRONY CURVED THE DREADFUL LIPS
THAT SPEAK THE WORD OF DOOM ETERNAL NIGHT
IN THE DIRE BEAUTY OF AN IMMORTAL FACE
PITYING AROSE RECEIVING ALL THAT LIVES
FOR EVER INTO ITS FATHOMLESS HEART REFUGE
OF CREATURES FROM THEIR ANGUISH AND WORLD-PAIN
HIS SHAPE WAS NOTHINGNESS MADE REAL HIS LIMBS
WERE MONUMENTS OF TRANSIENCE AND BENEATH
BROWS OF UNWEARYING CALM LARGE GODLIKE LIDS
SILENT BEHELD THE WRITHING SERPENT LIFE
UNMOVED THEIR TIMELESS WIDE UNCHANGING GAZE
HAD SEEN THE UNPROFITABLE CYCLES PASS
SURVIVED THE PASSING OF UNNUMBERED STARS
AND SHELTERED STILL THE SAME IMMUTABLE ORBS
THE TWO OPPOSED EACH OTHER WITH THEIR EYES
WOMAN AND UNIVERSAL GOD AROUND HER
PILING THEIR VOID UNBEARABLE LONELINESS
UPON HER MIGHTY UNCOMPANIONED SOUL
MANY INHUMAN SOLITUDES CAME CLOSE
VACANT ETERNITIES FORBIDDING HOPE
LAID UPON HER THEIR HUGE AND LIFELESS LOOK
AND TO HER EARS SILENCING EARTHLY SOUNDS
A SAD AND FORMIDABLE VOICE AROSE
575
WHICH SEEMED THE WHOLE ADVERSE WORLD'S UNCLASP IT CRIED
THY PASSIONATE INFLUENCE AND RELAX O SLAVE
OF NATURE CHANGING TOOL OF CHANGELESS LAW
WHO VAINLY WRITH'ST REBELLION TO MY YOKE
THY ELEMENTAL GRASP WEEP AND FORGET
ENTOMB THY PASSION IN ITS LIVING GRAVE
LEAVE NOW THE ONCE-LOVED SPIRIT'S ABANDONED ROBE
PASS LONELY BACK TO THY VAIN LIFE ON EARTH
IT CEASED SHE MOVED NOT AND IT SPOKE AGAIN
LOWERING ITS MIGHTY KEY TO HUMAN CHORDS
YET A DREAD CRY BEHIND THE UTTERED SOUNDS
ECHOING ALL SADNESS AND IMMORTAL SCORN
MOANED LIKE A HUNGER OF FAR WANDERING WAVES
WILT THOU FOR EVER KEEP THY PASSIONATE HOLD
THYSELF A CREATURE DOOMED LIKE HIM TO PASS
DENYING HIS SOUL DEATH'S CALM AND SILENT REST
RELAX THY GRASP THIS BODY IS EARTH'S AND THINE
HIS SPIRIT NOW BELONGS TO A GREATER POWER
WOMAN THY HUSBAND SUFFERS SAVITRI
DREW BACK HER HEART'S FORCE THAT CLASPED HIS BODY STILL
WHERE FROM HER LAP RENOUNCED ON THE SMOOTH GRASS
SOFTLY IT LAY AS OFTEN BEFORE IN SLEEP
WHEN FROM THEIR COUCH SHE ROSE IN THE WHITE DAWN
CALLED BY HER DAILY TASKS NOW TOO AS IF CALLED
SHE ROSE AND STOOD GATHERED IN LONELY STRENGTH
LIKE ONE WHO DROPS HIS MANTLE FOR A RACE
AND WAITS THE SIGNAL MOTIONLESSLY SWIFT
SHE KNEW NOT TO WHAT COURSE HER SPIRIT ABOVE
ON THE CRYPT-SUMMIT OF HER SECRET FORM
LIKE ONE LEFT SENTINEL ON A MOUNTAIN CREST
A FIERY-FOOTED SPLENDOUR PUISSANT-WINGED
WATCHED FLAMING-SILENT WITH HER VOICELESS SOUL
LIKE A STILL SAIL UPON A WINDLESS SEA
WHITE PASSIONLESS IT RODE AN ANCHORED MIGHT
WAITING WHAT FAR-RIDGED IMPULSE SHOULD ARISE
OUT OF THE ETERNAL DEPTHS AND CAST ITS SURGE
576
THEN DEATH THE KING LEANED BOUNDLESS DOWN AS LEANS
NIGHT OVER TIRED LANDS WHEN EVENING PALES
AND FADING GLEAMS BREAK DOWN THE HORIZON'S WALLS
NOR YET THE DUSK GROWS MYSTIC WITH THE MOON
THE DIM AND AWFUL GODHEAD ROSE ERECT
FROM HIS BRIEF STOOPING TO HIS TOUCH ON EARTH
AND LIKE A DREAM THAT WAKES OUT OF A DREAM
FORSAKING THE POOR MOULD OF THAT DEAD CLAY
ANOTHER LUMINOUS SATYAVAN AROSE
STARTING UPRIGHT FROM THE RECUMBENT EARTH
AS IF SOMEONE OVER VIEWLESS BORDERS STEPPED
EMERGING ON THE EDGE OF UNSEEN WORLDS
IN THE EARTH'S DAY THE SILENT MARVEL STOOD
BETWEEN THE MORTAL WOMAN AND THE GOD
SUCH SEEMED HE AS IF ONE DEPARTED CAME
WEARING THE LIGHT OF A CELESTIAL SHAPE
SPLENDIDLY ALIEN TO THE MORTAL AIR
THE MIND SOUGHT THINGS LONG LOVED AND FELL BACK FOILED
FROM UNFAMILIAR HUES BEHELD YET LONGED
BY THE SWEET RADIANT FORM UNSATISFIED
INCREDULOUS OF ITS TOO BRIGHT HINTS OF HEAVEN
TOO STRANGE THE BRILLIANT PHANTASM TO LIFE'S CLASP
DESIRING THE WARM CREATIONS OF THE EARTH
REARED IN THE ARDOUR OF MATERIAL SUNS
THE SENSES SEIZED IN VAIN A GLORIOUS SHADE
ONLY THE SPIRIT KNEW THE SPIRIT STILL
AND THE HEART DIVINED THE OLD LOVED HEART THOUGH CHANGED
BETWEEN TWO REALMS HE STOOD NOT WAVERING
BUT FIXED IN QUIET STRONG EXPECTANCY
LIKE ONE WHO SIGHTLESS LISTENS FOR A COMMAND
SO WERE THEY IMMOBILE ON THAT EARTHLY FIELD
POWERS NOT OF EARTH THOUGH ONE IN HUMAN CLAY
ON EITHER SIDE OF ONE TWO SPIRITS STROVE
SILENCE BATTLED WITH SILENCE VAST WITH VAST
BUT NOW THE IMPULSE OF THE PATH WAS FELT
MOVING FROM THE SILENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE STARS
577
TO TOUCH THE CONFINES OF THE VISIBLE WORLD
LUMINOUS HE MOVED AWAY BEHIND HIM DEATH
WENT SLOWLY WITH HIS NOISELESS TREAD AS SEEN
IN DREAM-BUILT FIELDS A SHADOWY HERDSMAN GLIDES
BEHIND SOME WANDERER FROM HIS VOICELESS HERDS
AND SAVITRI MOVED BEHIND ETERNAL DEATH
HER MORTAL PACE WAS EQUALLED WITH THE GOD'S
WORDLESS SHE TRAVELLED IN HER LOVER'S STEPS
PLANTING HER HUMAN FEET WHERE HIS HAD TROD
INTO THE PERILOUS SILENCES BEYOND
AT FIRST IN A BLIND STRESS OF WOODS SHE MOVED
WITH STRANGE INHUMAN PACES ON THE SOIL
JOURNEYING AS IF UPON AN UNSEEN ROAD
AROUND HER ON THE GREEN AND IMAGED EARTH
THE FLICKERING SCREEN OF FORESTS RINGED HER STEPS
ITS THICK LUXURIOUS OBSTACLE OF BOUGHS
BESIEGED HER BODY PRESSING DIMLY THROUGH
IN A RICH REALM OF WHISPERS PALPABLE
AND ALL THE MURMUROUS BEAUTY OF THE LEAVES
RIPPLED AROUND HER LIKE AN EMERALD ROBE
BUT MORE AND MORE THIS GREW AN ALIEN SOUND
AND HER OLD INTIMATE BODY SEEMED TO HER
A BURDEN WHICH HER BEING REMOTELY BORE
HERSELF LIVED FAR IN SOME UPLIFTED SCENE
WHERE TO THE TRANCE-CLAIMED VISION OF PURSUIT
SOLE PRESENCES IN A HIGH SPACELESS DREAM
THE LUMINOUS SPIRIT GLIDED STILLY ON
AND THE GREAT SHADOW TRAVELLED VAGUE BEHIND
STILL WITH AN AMOROUS CROWD OF SEEKING HANDS
SOFTLY ENTREATED BY THEIR OLD DESIRES
HER SENSES FELT EARTH'S CLOSE AND GENTLE AIR
CLING ROUND THEM AND IN TROUBLED BRANCHES KNEW
UNCERTAIN TREADINGS OF A FAINT-FOOT WIND
SHE BORE DIM FRAGRANCES FAR CALLINGS TOUCHED
THE WILD BIRD'S VOICE AND ITS WINGED RUSTLE CAME
578
AS IF A SIGH FROM SOME FORGOTTEN WORLD
EARTH STOOD ALOOF YET NEAR ROUND HER IT WOVE
ITS SWEETNESS AND ITS GREENNESS AND DELIGHT
ITS BRILLIANCE SUAVE OF WELL-LOVED VIVID HUES
SUNLIGHT ARRIVING TO ITS GOLDEN NOON
AND THE BLUE HEAVENS AND THE CARESSING SOIL
THE ANCIENT MOTHER OFFERED TO HER CHILD
HER SIMPLE WORLD OF KIND FAMILIAR THINGS
BUT NOW AS IF THE BODY'S SENSUOUS HOLD
CURBING THE GODHEAD OF HER INFINITE WALK
HAD FREED THOSE SPIRITS TO THEIR GRANDER ROAD
ACROSS SOME BOUNDARY'S INTANGIBLE BAR
THE SILENT GOD GREW MIGHTY AND REMOTE
IN OTHER SPACES AND THE SOUL SHE LOVED
LOST ITS CONSENTING NEARNESS TO HER LIFE
INTO A DEEP AND UNFAMILIAR AIR
ENORMOUS WINDLESS WITHOUT STIR OR SOUND
THEY SEEMED TO ENLARGE AWAY DRAWN BY SOME WIDE
PALE DISTANCE FROM THE WARM CONTROL OF EARTH
AND HER GROWN FAR NOW NOW THEY WOULD ESCAPE
THEN FLAMING FROM HER BODY'S NEST ALARMED
HER VIOLENT SPIRIT SOARED AT SATYAVAN
OUT MID THE PLUNGE OF HEAVEN-SURROUNDED ROCKS
SO IN A TERROR AND A WRATH DIVINE
FROM HER EYRIE STREAMS AGAINST THE ASCENDING DEATH
INDIGNANT AT ITS CROUCHING POINT OF STEEL
A FIERCE SHE-EAGLE THREATENED IN HER BROOD
BORNE ON A RUSH OF PUISSANCE AND A CRY
OUTWINGING LIKE A MASS OF GOLDEN FIRE
SO ON A SPIRIT'S FLAMING OUTRUSH BORNE
SHE CROSSED THE BORDERS OF DIVIDING SENSE
LIKE PALE DISCARDED SHEATHS DROPPED DULLY DOWN
HER MORTAL MEMBERS FELL BACK FROM HER SOUL
A MOMENT OF A SECRET BODY'S SLEEP
HER TRANCE KNEW NOT OF SUN OR EARTH OR WORLD
THOUGHT TIME AND DEATH WERE ABSENT FROM HER GRASP
579
SHE KNEW NOT SELF FORGOTTEN WAS SAVITRI
ALL WAS THE VIOLENT OCEAN OF A WILL
WHERE LIVED CAPTIVE TO AN IMMENSE CARESS
POSSESSED IN A SUPREME IDENTITY
HER AIM JOY ORIGIN SATYAVAN ALONE
HER SOVEREIGN PRISONED IN HER BEING'S CORE
HE BEAT THERE LIKE A RHYTHMIC HEART HERSELF
BUT DIFFERENT STILL ONE LOVED ENVELOPED CLASPED
A TREASURE SAVED FROM THE COLLAPSE OF SPACE
AROUND HIM NAMELESS INFINITE SHE SURGED
HER SPIRIT FULFILLED IN HIS SPIRIT RICH WITH ALL TIME
AS IF LOVE'S DEATHLESS MOMENT HAD BEEN FOUND
A PEARL WITHIN ETERNITY'S WHITE SHELL
THEN OUT OF THE ENGULFING SEA OF TRANCE
HER MIND ROSE DRENCHED TO LIGHT STREAMING WITH HUES
OF VISION AND AWAKE ONCE MORE TO TIME
RETURNED TO SHAPE THE LINEAMENTS OF THINGS
AND LIVE IN BORDERS OF THE SEEN AND KNOWN
ONWARD THE THREE STILL MOVED IN HER SOUL-SCENE
AS IF PACING THROUGH FRAGMENTS OF A DREAM
SHE SEEMED TO TRAVEL ON A VISIONED SHAPE
IMAGINING OTHER MUSERS LIKE HERSELF
BY THEM IMAGINED IN THEIR LONELY SLEEP
UNGRASPED UNREAL YET FAMILIAR OLD
LIKE CLEFTS OF UNSUBSTANTIAL MEMORY
SCENES OFTEN TRAVERSED NEVER LIVED IN FLED
PAST HER UNHEEDING TO FORGOTTEN GOALS
IN VOICELESS REGIONS THEY WERE TRAVELLERS
ALONE IN A NEW WORLD WHERE SOULS WERE NOT
BUT ONLY LIVING MOODS A STRANGE HUSHED WEIRD
COUNTRY WAS ROUND THEM STRANGE FAR SKIES ABOVE
A DOUBTING SPACE WHERE DREAMING OBJECTS LIVED
WITHIN THEMSELVES THEIR ONE UNCHANGED IDEA
WEIRD WERE THE GRASSES WEIRD THE TREELESS PLAINS
WEIRD RAN THE ROAD WHICH LIKE FEAR HASTENING
TOWARDS THAT OF WHICH IT HAS MOST TERROR PASSED
580
PHANTASMAL BETWEEN PILLARED CONSCIOUS ROCKS
SOMBRE AND HIGH GATES BROODING WHOSE STONE THOUGHTS
LOST THEIR HUGE SENSE BEYOND IN GIANT NIGHT
ENIGMA OF THE INCONSCIENT'S SCULPTURAL SLEEP
SYMBOLS OF THE APPROACH TO DARKNESS OLD
AND MONUMENTS OF HER TITANIC REIGN
OPENING TO DEPTHS LIKE DUMB APPALLING JAWS
THAT WAIT A TRAVELLER DOWN A HAUNTED PATH
ATTRACTED TO A MYSTERY THAT SLAYS
THEY WATCHED ACROSS HER ROAD CRUEL AND STILL
SENTINELS THEY STOOD OF DUMB NECESSITY
MUTE HEADS OF VIGILANT AND SULLEN GLOOM
CARVED MUZZLE OF A DIM ENORMOUS WORLD
THEN TO THAT CHILL SERE HEAVY LINE ARRIVED
WHERE HIS FEET TOUCHED THE SHADOWY MARCHES' BRINK
TURNING ARRESTED LUMINOUS SATYAVAN
LOOKED BACK WITH HIS WONDERFUL EYES AT SAVITRI
BUT DEATH PEALED FORTH HIS VAST ABYSMAL CRY
O MORTAL TURN BACK TO THY TRANSIENT KIND
ASPIRE NOT TO ACCOMPANY DEATH TO HIS HOME
AS IF THY BREATH COULD LIVE WHERE TIME MUST DIE
THINK NOT THY MIND-BORN PASSION STRENGTH FROM HEAVEN
TO UPLIFT THY SPIRIT FROM ITS EARTHLY BASE
AND BREAKING OUT FROM THE MATERIAL CAGE
TO UPBUOY THY FEET OF DREAM IN GROUNDLESS NOUGHT
AND BEAR THEE THROUGH THE PATHLESS INFINITE
ONLY IN HUMAN LIMITS MAN LIVES SAFE
TRUST NOT IN THE UNREAL LORDS OF TIME
IMMORTAL DEEMING THIS IMAGE OF THYSELF
WHICH THEY HAVE BUILT ON A DREAM'S FLOATING GROUND
LET NOT THE DREADFUL GODDESS MOVE THY SOUL
TO ENLARGE THY VEHEMENT TRESPASS INTO WORLDS
WHERE IT SHALL PERISH LIKE A HELPLESS THOUGHT
KNOW THE COLD TERM-STONES OF THY HOPES IN LIFE
ARMED VAINLY WITH THE IDEAL'S BORROWED MIGHT
DARE NOT TO OUTSTEP MAN'S BOUND AND MEASURED FORCE
581
IGNORANT AND STUMBLING IN BRIEF BOUNDARIES PENT
HE CROWNS HIMSELF THE WORLD'S MOCK SUZERAIN
TORMENTING NATURE WITH THE WORKS OF MIND
O SLEEPER DREAMING OF DIVINITY
WAKE TREMBLING MID THE INDIFFERENT SILENCES
IN WHICH THY FEW WEAK CHORDS OF BEING DIE
IMPERMANENT CREATURES SORROWFUL FOAM OF TIME
YOUR TRANSIENT LOVES BIND NOT THE ETERNAL GODS
THE DREAD VOICE EBBED IN THE CONSENTING HUSH
WHICH SEEMED TO CLOSE UPON IT WIDE INTENSE
A WORDLESS SANCTION FROM THE JAWS OF NIGHT
THE WOMAN ANSWERED NOT HER HIGH NUDE SOUL
STRIPPED OF THE GIRDLE OF MORTALITY
AGAINST FIXED DESTINY AND THE GROOVES OF LAW
STOOD UP IN ITS SHEER WILL A PRIMAL FORCE
STILL LIKE A STATUE ON ITS PEDESTAL
LONE IN THE SILENCE AND TO VASTNESS BARED
AGAINST MIDNIGHT'S DUMB ABYSSES PILED IN FRONT
A COLUMNED SHAFT OF FIRE AND LIGHT SHE ROSE
582
AWHILE ON THE CHILL DREADFUL EDGE OF NIGHT
ALL STOOD AS IF A WORLD WERE DOOMED TO DIE
AND WAITED ON THE ETERNAL SILENCE' BRINK
HEAVEN LEANED TOWARDS THEM LIKE A CLOUDY BROW
OF MENACE THROUGH THE DIM AND VOICELESS HUSH
AS THOUGHTS STAND MUTE ON A DESPAIRING VERGE
WHERE THE LAST DEPTHS PLUNGE INTO NOTHINGNESS
AND THE LAST DREAMS MUST END THEY PAUSED IN THEIR FRONT
WERE GLOOMS LIKE SHADOWY WINGS BEHIND THEM PALE
THE LIFELESS EVENING WAS A DEAD MAN'S GAZE
HUNGRY BEYOND THE NIGHT DESIRED HER SOUL
BUT STILL IN ITS LONE NICHE OF TEMPLED STRENGTH
MOTIONLESS HER FLAME-BRIGHT SPIRIT MUTE ERECT
BURNED LIKE A TORCH-FIRE FROM A WINDOWED ROOM
POINTING AGAINST THE DARKNESS' SOMBRE BREAST
THE WOMAN FIRST AFFRONTED THE ABYSS
DARING TO JOURNEY THROUGH THE ETERNAL NIGHT
ARMOURED WITH LIGHT SHE ADVANCED HER FOOT TO PLUNGE
INTO THE DREAD AND HUELESS VACANCY
IMMORTAL UNAPPALLED HER SPIRIT FACED
THE DANGER OF THE RUTHLESS EYELESS WASTE
AGAINST NIGHT'S INKY GROUND THEY STIRRED MOULDING
MYSTERIOUS MOTION ON HER HUMAN TREAD
A SWIMMING ACTION AND A DRIFTING MARCH
LIKE FIGURES MOVING BEFORE EYELIDS CLOSED
ALL AS IN DREAMS WENT SLIPPING GLIDING ON
THE ROCK-GATE'S HEAVY WALLS WERE LEFT BEHIND
AS IF THROUGH PASSAGES OF RECEDING TIME
PRESENT AND PAST INTO THE TIMELESS LAPSED
ARRESTED UPON DIM ADVENTURE'S BRINK
583
THE FUTURE ENDED DROWNED IN NOTHINGNESS
AMID COLLAPSING SHAPES THEY WOUND OBSCURE
THE FADING VESTIBULES OF A TENEBROUS WORLD
RECEIVED THEM WHERE THEY SEEMED TO MOVE AND YET
BE STILL NOWHERE ADVANCING YET TO PASS
A DUMB PROCESSION A DIM PICTURE BOUNDS
NOT CONSCIOUS FORMS THREADING A REAL SCENE
A MYSTERY OF TERROR'S BOUNDLESSNESS
GATHERING ITS HUNGRY STRENGTH THE HUGE PITILESS VOID
SURROUNDED SLOWLY WITH ITS SOUNDLESS DEPTHS
AND MONSTROUS CAVERNOUS A SHAPELESS THROAT
DEVOURED HER INTO ITS SHADOWY STRANGLING MASS
THE FIERCE SPIRITUAL AGONY OF A DREAM
A CURTAIN OF IMPENETRABLE DREAD
THE DARKNESS HUNG AROUND HER CAGE OF SENSE
AS WHEN THE TREES HAVE TURNED TO BLOTTED SHADES
AND THE LAST FRIENDLY GLIMMER FADES AWAY
AROUND A BULLOCK IN THE FOREST TIED
BY HUNTERS CLOSES IN NO EMPTY NIGHT
THE THOUGHT THAT STRIVES IN THE WORLD WAS HERE UNMADE
ITS EFFORT IT RENOUNCED TO LIVE AND KNOW
CONVINCED AT LAST THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN
IT PERISHED ALL ITS DREAM OF ACTION DONE
THIS CLOTTED CYPHER WAS ITS DARK RESULT
IN THE SMOTHERING STRESS OF THIS STUPENDOUS NOUGHT
MIND COULD NOT THINK BREATH COULD NOT BREATHE THE SOUL
COULD NOT REMEMBER OR FEEL ITSELF IT SEEMED
A HOLLOW GULF OF STERILE EMPTINESS
A ZERO OBLIVIOUS OF THE SUM IT CLOSED
AN ABNEGATION OF THE MAKER'S JOY
SAVED BY NO WIDE REPOSE NO DEPTH OF PEACE
ON ALL THAT CLAIMS HERE TO BE TRUTH AND GOD
AND CONSCIOUS SELF AND THE REVEALING WORD
AND THE CREATIVE RAPTURE OF THE MIND
AND LOVE AND KNOWLEDGE AND HEART'S DELIGHT THERE FELL
THE IMMENSE REFUSAL OF THE ETERNAL NO
584
AS DISAPPEARS A GOLDEN LAMP IN GLOOM
BORNE INTO DISTANCE FROM THE EYES' DESIRE
INTO THE SHADOWS VANISHED SAVITRI
THERE WAS NO COURSE NO PATH NO END OR GOAL
VISIONLESS SHE MOVED AMID INSENSIBLE GULFS
OR DROVE THROUGH SOME GREAT BLACK UNKNOWING WASTE
OR WHIRLED IN A DUMB EDDY OF MEETING WINDS
ASSEMBLED BY THE TITAN HANDS OF CHANCE
THERE WAS NONE WITH HER IN THE DREADFUL VAST
SHE SAW NO MORE THE VAGUE TREMENDOUS GOD
HER EYES HAD LOST THEIR LUMINOUS SATYAVAN
YET NOT FOR THIS HER SPIRIT FAILED BUT HELD
MORE DEEPLY THAN THE BOUNDED SENSES CAN
WHICH GRASP EXTERNALLY AND FIND TO LOSE
ITS OBJECT LOVED SO WHEN ON EARTH THEY LIVED
SHE HAD FELT HIM STRAYING THROUGH THE GLADES THE GLADES
A SCENE IN HER ITS CLEFTS HER BEING'S VISTAS
OPENING THEIR SECRETS TO HIS SEARCH AND JOY
BECAUSE TO JEALOUS SWEETNESS IN HER HEART
WHATEVER HAPPY SPACE HIS CHERISHED FEET
PREFERRED MUST BE AT ONCE HER SOUL EMBRACING
HIS BODY PASSIONING DUMBLY TO HIS TREAD
BUT NOW A SILENT GULF BETWEEN THEM CAME
AND TO ABYSMAL LONELINESS SHE FELL
EVEN FROM HERSELF CAST OUT FROM LOVE REMOTE
LONG HOURS SINCE LONG IT SEEMS WHEN SLUGGISH TIME
IS MEASURED BY THE THROBS OF THE SOUL'S PAIN
IN AN UNREAL DARKNESS EMPTY AND DREAR
SHE TRAVELLED TREADING ON THE CORPSE OF LIFE
LOST IN A BLINDNESS OF EXTINGUISHED SOULS
SOLITARY IN THE ANGUISH OF THE VOID
SHE LIVED IN SPITE OF DEATH SHE CONQUERED STILL
IN VAIN HER PUISSANT BEING WAS OPPRESSED
HER HEAVY LONG MONOTONY OF PAIN
TARDILY OF ITS FIERCE SELF-TORTURE TIRED
AT FIRST A FAINT INEXTINGUISHABLE GLEAM
585
PALE BUT IMMORTAL FLICKERED IN THE GLOOM
AS IF A MEMORY CAME TO SPIRITS DEAD
A MEMORY THAT WISHED TO LIVE AGAIN
DISSOLVED FROM MIND IN NATURE'S NATAL SLEEP
IT WANDERED LIKE A LOST RAY OF THE MOON
REVEALING TO THE NIGHT HER SOUL OF DREAD
SERPENTINE IN THE GLEAM THE DARKNESS LOLLED
ITS BLACK HOODS JEWELLED WITH THE MYSTIC GLOW
ITS DULL SLEEK FOLDS SHRANK BACK AND COILED AND SLID
AS THOUGH THEY FELT ALL LIGHT A CRUEL PAIN
AND SUFFERED FROM THE PALE APPROACH OF HOPE
NIGHT FELT ASSAILED HER HEAVY SOMBRE REIGN
THE SPLENDOUR OF SOME BRIGHT ETERNITY
THREATENED WITH THIS FAINT BEAM OF WANDERING TRUTH
HER EMPIRE OF THE EVERLASTING NOUGHT
IMPLACABLE IN HER INTOLERANT STRENGTH
AND CONFIDENT THAT SHE ALONE WAS TRUE
SHE STROVE TO STIFLE THE FRAIL DANGEROUS RAY
AWARE OF AN ALL-NEGATING IMMENSITY
SHE REARED HER GIANT HEAD OF NOTHINGNESS
HER MOUTH OF DARKNESS SWALLOWING ALL THAT IS
SHE SAW IN HERSELF THE TENEBROUS ABSOLUTE
BUT STILL THE LIGHT PREVAILED AND STILL IT GREW
AND SAVITRI TO HER LOST SELF AWOKE
HER LIMBS REFUSED THE COLD EMBRACE OF DEATH
HER HEART-BEATS TRIUMPHED IN THE GRASP OF PAIN
HER SOUL PERSISTED CLAIMING FOR ITS JOY
THE SOUL OF THE BELOVED NOW SEEN NO MORE
BEFORE HER IN THE STILLNESS OF THE WORLD
ONCE MORE SHE HEARD THE TREADING OF A GOD
AND OUT OF THE DUMB DARKNESS SATYAVAN
HER HUSBAND GREW INTO A LUMINOUS SHADE
THEN A SOUND PEALED THROUGH THAT DEAD MONSTROUS REALM
VAST LIKE THE SURGE IN A TIRED SWIMMER'S EARS
CLAMOURING A FATAL IRON-HEARTED ROAR
DEATH MISSIONED TO THE NIGHT HIS LETHAL CALL
586
THIS IS MY SILENT DARK IMMENSITY
THIS IS THE HOME OF EVERLASTING NIGHT
THIS IS THE SECRECY OF NOTHINGNESS
ENTOMBING THE VANITY OF LIFE'S DESIRES
HAST THOU BEHELD THY SOURCE O TRANSIENT HEART
AND KNOWN FROM WHAT THE DREAM THOU ART WAS MADE
IN THIS STARK SINCERITY OF NUDE EMPTINESS
HOPEST THOU STILL ALWAYS TO LAST AND LOVE
THE WOMAN ANSWERED NOT HER SPIRIT REFUSED
THE VOICE OF NIGHT THAT KNEW AND DEATH THAT THOUGHT
IN HER BEGINNINGLESS INFINITY
THROUGH HER SOUL'S REACHES UNCONFINED SHE GAZED
SHE SAW THE UNDYING FOUNTAINS OF HER LIFE
SHE KNEW HERSELF ETERNAL WITHOUT BIRTH
BUT STILL OPPOSING HER WITH ENDLESS NIGHT
DEATH THE DIRE GOD INFLICTED ON HER EYES
THE IMMORTAL CALM OF HIS TREMENDOUS GAZE
ALTHOUGH THOU HAST SURVIVED THE UNBORN VOID
WHICH NEVER SHALL FORGIVE WHILE TIME ENDURES
THE PRIMAL VIOLENCE THAT FASHIONED THOUGHT
FORCING THE IMMOBILE VAST TO SUFFER AND LIVE
THIS SORROWFUL VICTORY ONLY HAST THOU WON
TO LIVE FOR A LITTLE WITHOUT SATYAVAN
WHAT SHALL THE ANCIENT GODDESS GIVE TO THEE
WHO HELPS THY HEART-BEATS ONLY SHE PROLONGS
THE NOTHING DREAMED EXISTENCE AND DELAYS
WITH THE LABOUR OF LIVING THY ETERNAL SLEEP
A FRAGILE MIRACLE OF THINKING CLAY
ARMED WITH ILLUSIONS WALKS THE CHILD OF TIME
TO FILL THE VOID AROUND HE FEELS AND DREADS
THE VOID HE CAME FROM AND TO WHICH HE GOES
HE MAGNIFIES HIS SELF AND NAMES IT GOD
HE CALLS THE HEAVENS TO HELP HIS SUFFERING HOPES
HE SEES ABOVE HIM WITH A LONGING HEART
BARE SPACES MORE UNCONSCIOUS THAN HIMSELF
THAT HAVE NOT EVEN HIS PRIVILEGE OF MIND
587
AND EMPTY OF ALL BUT THEIR UNREAL BLUE
AND PEOPLES THEM WITH BRIGHT AND MERCIFUL POWERS
FOR THE SEA ROARS AROUND HIM AND EARTH QUAKES
BENEATH HIS STEPS AND FIRE IS AT HIS DOORS
AND DEATH PROWLS BAYING THROUGH THE WOODS OF LIFE
MOVED BY THE PRESENCES WITH WHICH HE YEARNS
HE OFFERS IN IMPLACABLE SHRINES HIS SOUL
AND CLOTHES ALL WITH THE BEAUTY OF HIS DREAMS
THE GODS WHO WATCH THE EARTH WITH SLEEPLESS EYES
AND GUIDE ITS GIANT STUMBLINGS THROUGH THE VOID
HAVE GIVEN TO MAN THE BURDEN OF HIS MIND
IN HIS UNWILLING HEART THEY HAVE LIT THEIR FIRES
AND SOWN IN IT INCURABLE UNREST
HIS MIND IS A HUNTER UPON TRACKS UNKNOWN
AMUSING TIME WITH VAIN DISCOVERY
HE DEEPENS WITH THOUGHT THE MYSTERY OF HIS FATE
AND TURNS TO SONG HIS LAUGHTER AND HIS TEARS
HIS MORTALITY VEXING WITH THE IMMORTAL'S DREAMS
TROUBLING HIS TRANSIENCE WITH THE INFINITE'S BREATH
THEY GAVE HIM HUNGERS WHICH NO FOOD CAN FILL
HE IS THE CATTLE OF THE SHEPHERD GODS
HIS BODY THE TETHER WITH WHICH HE IS TIED
THEY CAST FOR FODDER GRIEF AND HOPE AND JOY
HIS PASTURE GROUND THEY HAVE FENCED WITH IGNORANCE
INTO HIS FRAGILE UNDEFENDED BREAST
THEY HAVE BREATHED A COURAGE THAT IS MET BY DEATH
THEY HAVE GIVEN A WISDOM THAT IS MOCKED BY NIGHT
THEY HAVE TRACED A JOURNEY THAT FORESEES NO GOAL
AIMLESS MAN TOILS IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD
LULLED BY INCONSTANT PAUSES OF HIS PAIN
SCOURGED LIKE A BEAST BY THE INFINITE DESIRE
BOUND TO THE CHARIOT OF THE DREADFUL GODS
BUT IF THOU STILL CANST HOPE AND STILL WOULDST LOVE
RETURN TO THY BODY'S SHELL THY TIE TO EARTH
AND WITH THY HEART'S LITTLE REMNANTS TRY TO LIVE
HOPE NOT TO WIN BACK TO THEE SATYAVAN
588
YET SINCE THY STRENGTH DESERVES NO TRIVIAL CROWN
GIFTS I CAN GIVE TO SOOTHE THY WOUNDED LIFE
THE PACTS WHICH TRANSIENT BEINGS MAKE WITH FATE
AND THE WAYSIDE SWEETNESS EARTH-BOUND HEARTS WOULD PLUCK
THESE IF THY WILL ACCEPTS MAKE FREELY THINE
CHOOSE A LIFE'S HOPES FOR THY DECEIVING PRIZE
AS CEASED THE RUTHLESS AND TREMENDOUS VOICE
UNENDINGLY THERE ROSE IN SAVITRI
LIKE MOONLIT RIDGES ON A SHUDDERING FLOOD
A STIR OF THOUGHTS OUT OF SOME SILENCE BORN
ACROSS THE SEA OF HER DUMB FATHOMLESS HEART
AT LAST SHE SPOKE HER VOICE WAS HEARD BY NIGHT
I BOW NOT TO THEE O HUGE MASK OF DEATH
BLACK LIE OF NIGHT TO THE COWED SOUL OF MAN
UNREAL INESCAPABLE END OF THINGS
THOU GRIM JEST PLAYED WITH THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT
CONSCIOUS OF IMMORTALITY I WALK
A VICTOR SPIRIT CONSCIOUS OF MY FORCE
NOT AS A SUPPLIANT TO THY GATES I CAME
UNSLAIN I HAVE SURVIVED THE CLUTCH OF NIGHT
MY FIRST STRONG GRIEF MOVES NOT MY SEATED MIND
MY UNWEPT TEARS HAVE TURNED TO PEARLS OF STRENGTH
I HAVE TRANSFORMED MY ILL-SHAPED BRITTLE CLAY
INTO THE HARDNESS OF A STATUED SOUL
NOW IN THE WRESTLING OF THE SPLENDID GODS
MY SPIRIT SHALL BE OBSTINATE AND STRONG
AGAINST THE VAST REFUSAL OF THE WORLD
I STOOP NOT WITH THE SUBJECT MOB OF MINDS
WHO RUN TO GLEAN WITH EAGER SATISFIED HANDS
AND PICK FROM ITS MIRE MID MANY TRAMPLING FEET
ITS SCORNFUL SMALL CONCESSIONS TO THE WEAK
MINE IS THE LABOUR OF THE BATTLING GODS
IMPOSING ON THE SLOW RELUCTANT YEARS
THE FLAMING WILL THAT REIGNS BEYOND THE STARS
THEY LAY THE LAW OF MIND ON MATTER'S WORKS
AND WIN THE SOUL'S WISH FROM EARTH'S INCONSCIENT FORCE
589
FIRST I DEMAND WHATEVER SATYAVAN
MY HUSBAND WAKING IN THE FOREST'S CHARM
OUT OF HIS LONG PURE CHILDHOOD'S LONELY DREAMS
DESIRED AND HAD NOT FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE
GIVE IF THOU MUST OR IF THOU CANST REFUSE
DEATH BOWED HIS HEAD IN SCORNFUL COLD ASSENT
THE BUILDER OF THIS DREAMLIKE EARTH FOR MAN
WHO HAS MOCKED WITH VANITY ALL GIFTS HE GAVE
UPLIFTING HIS DISASTROUS VOICE HE SPOKE
INDULGENT TO THE DREAMS MY TOUCH SHALL BREAK
I YIELD TO HIS BLIND FATHER'S LONGING HEART
KINGDOM AND POWER AND FRIENDS AND GREATNESS LOST
AND ROYAL TRAPPINGS FOR HIS PEACEFUL AGE
THE PALLID POMPS OF MAN'S DECLINING DAYS
THE SILVERED DECADENT GLORIES OF LIFE'S FALL
TO ONE WHO WISER GREW BY ADVERSE FATE
GOODS I RESTORE THE DELUDED SOUL PREFERS
TO IMPERSONAL NOTHINGNESS'S BARE SUBLIME
THE SENSUOUS SOLACE OF THE LIGHT I GIVE
TO EYES WHICH COULD HAVE FOUND A LARGER REALM
A DEEPER VISION IN THEIR FATHOMLESS NIGHT
FOR THAT THIS MAN DESIRED AND ASKED IN VAIN
WHILE STILL HE LIVED ON EARTH AND CHERISHED HOPE
BACK FROM THE GRANDEUR OF MY PERILOUS REALMS
GO MORTAL TO THY SMALL PERMITTED SPHERE
HASTEN SWIFT-FOOTED LEST TO SLAY THY LIFE
THE GREAT LAWS THOU HAST VIOLATED MOVED
OPEN AT LAST ON THEE THEIR MARBLE EYES
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED THE DISDAINFUL SHADE
WORLD-SPIRIT I WAS THY EQUAL SPIRIT BORN
MY WILL TOO IS A LAW MY STRENGTH A GOD
I AM IMMORTAL IN MY MORTALITY
I TREMBLE NOT BEFORE THE IMMOBILE GAZE
OF THE UNCHANGING MARBLE HIERARCHIES
THAT LOOK WITH THE STONE EYES OF LAW AND FATE
MY SOUL CAN MEET THEM WITH ITS LIVING FIRE
590
OUT OF THY SHADOW GIVE ME BACK AGAIN
INTO EARTH'S FLOWERING SPACES SATYAVAN
IN THE SWEET TRANSIENCY OF HUMAN LIMBS
TO DO WITH HIM MY SPIRIT'S BURNING WILL
I WILL BEAR WITH HIM THE ANCIENT MOTHER'S LOAD
I WILL FOLLOW WITH HIM EARTH'S PATH THAT LEADS TO GOD
ELSE SHALL THE ETERNAL SPACES OPEN TO ME
WHILE ROUND US STRANGE HORIZONS FAR RECEDE
TRAVELLING TOGETHER THE IMMENSE UNKNOWN
FOR I WHO HAVE TROD WITH HIM THE TRACTS OF TIME
CAN MEET BEHIND HIS STEPS WHATEVER NIGHT
OR UNIMAGINABLE STUPENDOUS DAWN
BREAKS ON OUR SPIRITS IN THE UNTROD BEYOND
WHEREVER THOU LEADST HIS SOUL I SHALL PURSUE
BUT TO HER CLAIM OPPOSED IMPLACABLE
INSISTING ON THE IMMUTABLE DECREE
INSISTING ON THE IMMITIGABLE LAW
AND THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF CREATED THINGS
OUT OF THE ROLLING WASTES OF NIGHT THERE CAME
BORN FROM THE ENIGMA OF THE UNKNOWABLE DEPTHS
A VOICE OF MAJESTY AND APPALLING SCORN
AS WHEN THE STORM-HAIRED TITAN-STRIDING SEA
THROWS ON A SWIMMER ITS TREMENDOUS LAUGH
REMEMBERING ALL THE JOY ITS WAVES HAVE DROWNED
SO FROM THE DARKNESS OF THE SOVEREIGN NIGHT
AGAINST THE WOMAN'S BOUNDLESS HEART AROSE
THE ALMIGHTY CRY OF UNIVERSAL DEATH
HAST THOU GOD-WINGS OR FEET THAT TREAD MY STARS
FRAIL CREATURE WITH THE COURAGE THAT ASPIRES
FORGETTING THY BOUNDS OF THOUGHT THY MORTAL ROLE
THEIR ORBS WERE COILED BEFORE THY SOUL WAS FORMED
I DEATH CREATED THEM OUT OF MY VOID
ALL THINGS I HAVE BUILT IN THEM AND I DESTROY
I MADE THE WORLDS MY NET EACH JOY A MESH
A HUNGER AMOROUS OF ITS SUFFERING PREY
LIFE THAT DEVOURS MY IMAGE SEE IN THINGS
591
MORTAL WHOSE SPIRIT IS MY WANDERING BREATH
WHOSE TRANSIENCE WAS IMAGINED BY MY SMILE
FLEE CLUTCHING THY POOR GAINS TO THY TREMBLING BREAST
PIERCED BY MY PANGS TIME SHALL NOT SOON APPEASE
BLIND SLAVE OF MY DEAF FORCE WHOM I COMPEL
TO SIN THAT I MAY PUNISH TO DESIRE
THAT I MAY SCOURGE THEE WITH DESPAIR AND GRIEF
AND THOU COME BLEEDING TO ME AT THE LAST
THY NOTHINGNESS RECOGNISED MY GREATNESS KNOWN
TURN NOR ATTEMPT FORBIDDEN HAPPY FIELDS
MEANT FOR THE SOULS THAT CAN OBEY MY LAW
LEST IN THEIR SOMBRE SHRINES THY TREAD AWAKE
FROM THEIR UNEASY IRON-HEARTED SLEEP
THE FURIES WHO AVENGE FULFILLED DESIRE
DREAD LEST IN SKIES WHERE PASSION HOPED TO LIVE
THE UNKNOWN'S LIGHTNINGS START AND TERRIFIED
LONE SOBBING HUNTED BY THE HOUNDS OF HEAVEN
A WOUNDED AND FORSAKEN SOUL THOU FLEE
THROUGH THE LONG TORTURE OF THE CENTURIES
NOR MANY LIVES EXHAUST THE TIRELESS WRATH
HELL CANNOT SLAKE NOR HEAVEN'S MERCY ASSUAGE
I WILL TAKE FROM THEE THE BLACK ETERNAL GRIP
CLASPING IN THY HEART THY FATE'S EXIGUOUS DOLE
DEPART IN PEACE IF PEACE FOR MAN IS JUST
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED MEETING SCORN WITH SCORN
THE MORTAL WOMAN TO THE DREADFUL LORD
WHO IS THIS GOD IMAGINED BY THY NIGHT
CONTEMPTUOUSLY CREATING WORLDS DISDAINED
WHO MADE FOR VANITY THE BRILLIANT STARS
NOT HE WHO HAS REARED HIS TEMPLE IN MY THOUGHTS
AND MADE HIS SACRED FLOOR MY HUMAN HEART
MY GOD IS WILL AND TRIUMPHS IN HIS PATHS
MY GOD IS LOVE AND SWEETLY SUFFERS ALL
TO HIM I HAVE OFFERED HOPE FOR SACRIFICE
AND GAVE MY LONGINGS AS A SACRAMENT
WHO SHALL PROHIBIT OR HEDGE IN HIS COURSE
592
THE WONDERFUL THE CHARIOTEER THE SWIFT
A TRAVELLER OF THE MILLION ROADS OF LIFE
HIS STEPS FAMILIAR WITH THE LIGHTS OF HEAVEN
TREAD WITHOUT PAIN THE SWORD-PAVED COURTS OF HELL
THERE HE DESCENDS TO EDGE ETERNAL JOY
LOVE'S GOLDEN WINGS HAVE POWER TO FAN THY VOID
THE EYES OF LOVE GAZE STARLIKE THROUGH DEATH'S NIGHT
THE FEET OF LOVE TREAD NAKED HARDEST WORLDS
HE LABOURS IN THE DEPTHS EXULTS ON THE HEIGHTS
HE SHALL REMAKE THY UNIVERSE O DEATH
SHE SPOKE AND FOR A WHILE NO VOICE REPLIED
WHILE STILL THEY TRAVELLED THROUGH THE TRACKLESS NIGHT
AND STILL THAT GLEAM WAS LIKE A PALLID EYE
TROUBLING THE DARKNESS WITH ITS DOUBTFUL GAZE
THEN ONCE MORE CAME A DEEP AND PERILOUS PAUSE
IN THAT UNREAL JOURNEY THROUGH BLIND NOUGHT
ONCE MORE A THOUGHT A WORD IN THE VOID AROSE
AND DEATH MADE ANSWER TO THE HUMAN SOUL
WHAT IS THY HOPE TO WHAT DOST THOU ASPIRE
THIS IS THY BODY'S SWEETEST LURE OF BLISS
ASSAILED BY PAIN A FRAIL PRECARIOUS FORM
TO PLEASE FOR A FEW YEARS THY FALTERING SENSE
WITH HONEY OF PHYSICAL LONGINGS AND THE HEART'S FIRE
AND A VAIN ONENESS SEEKING TO EMBRACE
THE BRILLIANT IDOL OF A FUGITIVE HOUR
AND THOU WHAT ART THOU SOUL THOU GLORIOUS DREAM
OF BRIEF EMOTIONS MADE AND GLITTERING THOUGHTS
A THIN DANCE OF FIREFLIES SPEEDING THROUGH THE NIGHT
A SPARKLING FERMENT IN LIFE'S SUNLIT MIRE
WILT THOU CLAIM IMMORTALITY O HEART
CRYING AGAINST THE ETERNAL WITNESSES
THAT THOU AND HE ARE ENDLESS POWERS AND LAST
DEATH ONLY LASTS AND THE INCONSCIENT VOID
I ONLY AM ETERNAL AND ENDURE
I AM THE SHAPELESS FORMIDABLE VAST
I AM THE EMPTINESS THAT MEN CALL SPACE
593
I AM A TIMELESS NOTHINGNESS CARRYING ALL
I AM THE ILLIMITABLE THE MUTE ALONE
I DEATH AM HE THERE IS NO OTHER GOD
ALL FROM MY DEPTHS ARE BORN THEY LIVE BY DEATH
ALL TO MY DEPTHS RETURN AND ARE NO MORE
I HAVE MADE A WORLD BY MY INCONSCIENT FORCE
MY FORCE IS NATURE THAT CREATES AND SLAYS
THE HEARTS THAT HOPE THE LIMBS THAT LONG TO LIVE
I HAVE MADE MAN HER INSTRUMENT AND SLAVE
HIS BODY I MADE MY BANQUET HIS LIFE MY FOOD
MAN HAS NO OTHER HELP BUT ONLY DEATH
HE COMES TO ME AT HIS END FOR REST AND PEACE
I DEATH AM THE ONE REFUGE OF THY SOUL
THE GODS TO WHOM MAN PRAYS CAN HELP NOT MAN
THEY ARE MY IMAGINATIONS AND MY MOODS
REFLECTED IN HIM BY ILLUSION'S POWER
THAT WHICH THOU SEEST AS THY IMMORTAL SELF
IS A SHADOWY ICON OF MY INFINITE
IS DEATH IN THEE DREAMING OF ETERNITY
I AM THE IMMOBILE IN WHICH ALL THINGS MOVE
I AM THE NUDE INANE IN WHICH THEY CEASE
I HAVE NO BODY AND NO TONGUE TO SPEAK
I COMMUNE NOT WITH HUMAN EYE AND EAR
ONLY THY THOUGHT GAVE A FIGURE TO MY VOID
BECAUSE O ASPIRANT TO DIVINITY
THOU CALLEDST ME TO WRESTLE WITH THY SOUL
I HAVE ASSUMED A FACE A FORM A VOICE
BUT IF THERE WERE A BEING WITNESSING ALL
HOW SHOULD HE HELP THY PASSIONATE DESIRE
ALOOF HE WATCHES SOLE AND ABSOLUTE
INDIFFERENT TO THY CRY IN NAMELESS CALM
HIS BEING IS PURE UNWOUNDED MOTIONLESS ONE
ONE ENDLESS WATCHES THE INCONSCIENT SCENE
WHERE ALL THINGS PERISH AS THE FOAM THE STARS
THE ONE LIVES FOR EVER THERE NO SATYAVAN
CHANGING WAS BORN AND THERE NO SAVITRI
594
CLAIMS FROM BRIEF LIFE HER BRIBE OF JOY THERE LOVE
CAME NEVER WITH HIS FRETFUL EYES OF TEARS
NOR TIME IS THERE NOR THE VAIN VASTS OF SPACE
IT WEARS NO LIVING FACE IT HAS NO NAME
NO GAZE NO HEART THAT THROBS IT ASKS NO SECOND
TO AID ITS BEING OR TO SHARE ITS JOYS
IT IS DELIGHT IMMORTALLY ALONE
IF THOU DESIREST IMMORTALITY
BE THEN ALONE SUFFICIENT TO THY SOUL
LIVE IN THYSELF FORGET THE MAN THOU LOV'ST
MY LAST GRAND DEATH SHALL RESCUE THEE FROM LIFE
THEN SHALT THOU RISE INTO THY UNMOVED SOURCE
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO THE DREAD VOICE
O DEATH WHO REASONEST I REASON NOT
REASON THAT SCANS AND BREAKS BUT CANNOT BUILD
OR BUILDS IN VAIN BECAUSE SHE DOUBTS HER WORK
I AM I LOVE I SEE I ACT I WILL
DEATH ANSWERED HER ONE DEEP SURROUNDING CRY
KNOW ALSO KNOWING THOU SHALT CEASE TO LOVE
AND CEASE TO WILL DELIVERED FROM THY HEART
SO SHALT THOU REST FOR EVER AND BE STILL
CONSENTING TO THE IMPERMANENCE OF THINGS
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED FOR MAN TO DEATH
WHEN I HAVE LOVED FOR EVER I SHALL KNOW
LOVE IN ME KNOWS THE TRUTH ALL CHANGINGS MASK
I KNOW THAT KNOWLEDGE IS A VAST EMBRACE
I KNOW THAT EVERY BEING IS MYSELF
IN EVERY HEART IS HIDDEN THE MYRIAD ONE
I KNOW THE CALM TRANSCENDENT BEARS THE WORLD
THE VEILED INHABITANT THE SILENT LORD
I FEEL HIS SECRET ACT HIS INTIMATE FIRE
I HEAR THE MURMUR OF THE COSMIC VOICE
I KNOW MY COMING WAS A WAVE FROM GOD
FOR ALL HIS SUNS WERE CONSCIENT IN MY BIRTH
AND ONE WHO LOVES IN US CAME VEILED BY DEATH
THEN WAS MAN BORN AMONG THE MONSTROUS STARS
595
DOWERED WITH A MIND AND HEART TO CONQUER THEE
IN THE ETERNITY OF HIS RUTHLESS WILL
SURE OF HIS EMPIRE AND HIS ARMOURED MIGHT
LIKE ONE DISDAINING VIOLENT HELPLESS WORDS
FROM VICTIM LIPS DEATH ANSWERED NOT AGAIN
HE STOOD IN SILENCE AND IN DARKNESS WRAPPED
A FIGURE MOTIONLESS A SHADOW VAGUE
GIRT WITH THE TERRORS OF HIS SECRET SWORD
HALF-SEEN IN CLOUDS APPEARED A SOMBRE FACE
NIGHT'S DUSK TIARA WAS HIS MATTED HAIR
THE ASHES OF THE PYRE HIS FOREHEAD'S SIGN
ONCE MORE A WANDERER IN THE UNENDING NIGHT
BLINDLY FORBIDDEN BY DEAD VACANT EYES
SHE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE DUMB UNHOPING VASTS
AROUND HER ROLLED THE SHUDDERING WASTE OF GLOOM
ITS SWALLOWING EMPTINESS AND JOYLESS DEATH
RESENTFUL OF HER THOUGHT AND LIFE AND LOVE
THROUGH THE LONG FADING NIGHT BY HER COMPELLED
GLIDING HALF-SEEN ON THEIR UNEARTHLY PATH
PHANTASMAL IN THE DIMNESS MOVED THE THREE
599
ALL STILL WAS DARKNESS DREAD AND DESOLATE
THERE WAS NO CHANGE NOR ANY HOPE OF CHANGE
IN THIS BLACK DREAM WHICH WAS A HOUSE OF VOID
A WALK TO NOWHERE IN A LAND OF NOUGHT
EVER THEY DRIFTED WITHOUT AIM OR GOAL
GLOOM LED TO WORSE GLOOM DEPTH TO AN EMPTIER DEPTH
IN SOME POSITIVE NON-BEING'S PURPOSELESS VAST
THROUGH FORMLESS WASTES DUMB AND UNKNOWABLE
AN INEFFECTUAL BEAM OF SUFFERING LIGHT
THROUGH THE DESPAIRING DARKNESS DOGGED THEIR STEPS
LIKE THE REMEMBRANCE OF A GLORY LOST
EVEN WHILE IT GREW IT SEEMED UNREAL THERE
YET HAUNTED NIHIL'S CHILL STUPENDOUS REALM
UNQUENCHABLE PERPETUAL LONELY NULL
A PALLID GHOST OF SOME DEAD ETERNITY
IT WAS AS IF SHE MUST PAY NOW HER DEBT
HER VAIN PRESUMPTION TO EXIST AND THINK
TO SOME BRILLIANT MAYA THAT CONCEIVED HER SOUL
THIS MOST SHE MUST ABSOLVE WITH ENDLESS PANGS
HER DEEP ORIGINAL SIN THE WILL TO BE
AND THE SIN LAST GREATEST THE SPIRITUAL PRIDE
THAT MADE OF DUST EQUALLED ITSELF WITH HEAVEN
ITS SCORN OF THE WORM WRITHING IN THE MUD
CONDEMNED EPHEMERAL BORN FROM NATURE'S DREAM
REFUSAL OF THE TRANSIENT CREATURE'S ROLE
THE CLAIM TO BE A LIVING FIRE OF GOD
THE WILL TO BE IMMORTAL AND DIVINE
IN THAT TREMENDOUS DARKNESS HEAVY AND BARE
SHE ATONED FOR ALL SINCE THE FIRST ACT WHENCE SPRANG
THE ERROR OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF TIME
THE RENDING OF THE INCONSCIENT'S SEAL OF SLEEP
600
THE PRIMAL AND UNPARDONED REVOLT THAT BROKE
THE PEACE AND SILENCE OF THE NOTHINGNESS
WHICH WAS BEFORE A SEEMING UNIVERSE
APPEARED IN A VANITY OF IMAGINED SPACE
AND LIFE AROSE ENGENDERING GRIEF AND PAIN
A GREAT NEGATION WAS THE REAL'S FACE
PROHIBITING THE VAIN PROCESS OF TIME
AND WHEN THERE IS NO WORLD NO CREATURE MORE
WHEN TIME'S INTRUSION HAS BEEN BLOTTED OUT
IT SHALL LAST UNBODIED SAVED FROM THOUGHT AT PEACE
ACCURSED IN WHAT HAD BEEN HER GODHEAD SOURCE
CONDEMNED TO LIVE FOR EVER EMPTY OF BLISS
HER IMMORTALITY HER CHASTISEMENT
HER SPIRIT GUILTY OF BEING WANDERED DOOMED
MOVING FOR EVER THROUGH ETERNAL NIGHT
BUT MAYA IS A VEIL OF THE ABSOLUTE
A TRUTH OCCULT HAS MADE THIS MIGHTY WORLD
THE ETERNAL'S WISDOM AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE ACT
IN IGNORANT MIND AND IN THE BODY'S STEPS
THE INCONSCIENT IS THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S SLEEP
AN UNINTELLIGIBLE INTELLIGENCE
INVENTS CREATION'S PARADOX PROFOUND
SPIRITUAL THOUGHT IS CRAMMED IN MATTER'S FORMS
UNSEEN IT THROWS OUT A DUMB ENERGY
AND WORKS A MIRACLE BY A MACHINE
ALL HERE IS A MYSTERY OF CONTRARIES
DARKNESS A MAGIC OF SELF-HIDDEN LIGHT
SUFFERING SOME SECRET RAPTURE'S TRAGIC MASK
AND DEATH AN INSTRUMENT OF PERPETUAL LIFE
ALTHOUGH DEATH WALKS BESIDE US ON LIFE'S ROAD
A DIM BYSTANDER AT THE BODY'S START
AND A LAST JUDGMENT ON MAN'S FUTILE WORKS
OTHER IS THE RIDDLE OF ITS AMBIGUOUS FACE
DEATH IS A STAIR A DOOR A STUMBLING STRIDE
THE SOUL MUST TAKE TO CROSS FROM BIRTH TO BIRTH
A GREY DEFEAT PREGNANT WITH VICTORY
601
A WHIP TO LASH US TOWARDS OUR DEATHLESS STATE
THE INCONSCIENT WORLD IS THE SPIRIT'S SELF-MADE ROOM
ETERNAL NIGHT SHADOW OF ETERNAL DAY
NIGHT IS NOT OUR BEGINNING NOR OUR END
SHE IS THE DARK MOTHER IN WHOSE WOMB WE HAVE HID
SAFE FROM TOO SWIFT A WAKING TO WORLD-PAIN
WE CAME TO HER FROM A SUPERNAL LIGHT
BY LIGHT WE LIVE AND TO THE LIGHT WE GO
HERE IN THIS SEAT OF DARKNESS MUTE AND LONE
IN THE HEART OF EVERLASTING NOTHINGNESS
LIGHT CONQUERED NOW EVEN BY THAT FEEBLE BEAM
ITS FAINT INFILTRATION DRILLED THE BLIND DEAF MASS
ALMOST IT CHANGED INTO A GLIMMERING SIGHT
THAT HOUSED THE PHANTOM OF AN AUREATE SUN
WHOSE ORB PUPILLED THE EYE OF NOTHINGNESS
A GOLDEN FIRE CAME IN AND BURNED NIGHT'S HEART
HER DUSKY MINDLESSNESS BEGAN TO DREAM
THE INCONSCIENT CONSCIOUS GREW NIGHT FELT AND THOUGHT
ASSAILED IN THE SOVEREIGN EMPTINESS OF ITS REIGN
THE INTOLERANT DARKNESS PALED AND DREW APART
TILL ONLY A FEW BLACK REMNANTS STAINED THAT RAY
BUT ON A FAILING EDGE OF DUMB LOST SPACE
STILL A GREAT DRAGON BODY SULLENLY LOOMED
ADVERSARY OF THE SLOW STRUGGLING DAWN
DEFENDING ITS GROUND OF TORTURED MYSTERY
IT TRAILED ITS COILS THROUGH THE DEAD MARTYRED AIR
AND CURVING FLED DOWN A GREY SLOPE OF TIME
THERE IS A MORNING TWILIGHT OF THE GODS
MIRACULOUS FROM SLEEP THEIR FORMS ARISE
AND GOD'S LONG NIGHTS ARE JUSTIFIED BY DAWN
THERE BREAKS A PASSION AND SPLENDOUR OF NEW BIRTH
AND HUE-WINGED VISIONS STRAY ACROSS THE LIDS
HEAVEN'S CHANTING HERALDS WAKEN DIM-EYED SPACE
THE DREAMING DEITIES LOOK BEYOND THE SEEN
AND FASHION IN THEIR THOUGHTS THE IDEAL WORLDS
602
SPRUNG FROM A LIMITLESS MOMENT OF DESIRE
THAT ONCE HAD LODGED IN SOME ABYSMAL HEART
PASSED WAS THE HEAVINESS OF THE EYELESS DARK
AND ALL THE SORROW OF THE NIGHT WAS DEAD
SURPRISED BY A BLIND JOY WITH GROPING HANDS
LIKE ONE WHO WAKES TO FIND HIS DREAMS WERE TRUE
INTO A HAPPY MISTY TWILIT WORLD
WHERE ALL RAN AFTER LIGHT AND JOY AND LOVE
SHE SLIPPED THERE FAR-OFF RAPTURES DREW MORE CLOSE
AND DEEP ANTICIPATIONS OF DELIGHT
FOR EVER EAGER TO BE GRASPED AND HELD
WERE NEVER GRASPED YET BREATHED STRANGE ECSTASY
A PEARL-WINGED INDISTINCTNESS FLEETING SWAM
AN AIR THAT DARED NOT SUFFER TOO MUCH LIGHT
VAGUE FIELDS WERE THERE VAGUE PASTURES GLEAMED VAGUE TREES
VAGUE SCENES DIM-HEARTED IN A DRIFTING HAZE
VAGUE CATTLE WHITE ROAMED GLIMMERING THROUGH THE MIST
VAGUE SPIRITS WANDERED WITH A BODILESS CRY
VAGUE MELODIES TOUCHED THE SOUL AND FLED PURSUED
INTO HARMONIOUS DISTANCES UNSEIZED
FORMS SUBTLY ELUSIVE AND HALF-LUMINOUS POWERS
WISHING NO GOAL FOR THEIR UNEARTHLY COURSE
STRAYED HAPPILY THROUGH VAGUE IDEAL LANDS
OR FLOATED WITHOUT FOOTING OR THEIR WALK
LEFT STEPS OF REVERIE ON SWEET MEMORY'S GROUND
OR THEY PACED TO THE MIGHTY MEASURE OF THEIR THOUGHTS
LED BY A LOW FAR CHANTING OF THE GODS
A RIPPLE OF GLEAMING WINGS CROSSED THE FAR SKY
BIRDS LIKE PALE-BOSOMED IMAGINATIONS FLEW
WITH LOW DISTURBING VOICES OF DESIRE
AND HALF-HEARD LOWINGS DREW THE LISTENING EAR
AS IF THE SUN-GOD'S BRILLIANT KINE WERE THERE
HIDDEN IN MIST AND PASSING TOWARDS THE SUN
THESE FUGITIVE BEINGS THESE ELUSIVE SHAPES
WERE ALL THAT CLAIMED THE EYE AND MET THE SOUL
THE NATURAL INHABITANTS OF THAT WORLD
603
BUT NOTHING THERE WAS FIXED OR STAYED FOR LONG
NO MORTAL FEET COULD REST UPON THAT SOIL
NO BREATH OF LIFE LINGERED EMBODIED THERE
IN THAT FINE CHAOS JOY FLED DANCING PAST
AND BEAUTY EVADED SETTLED LINE AND FORM
AND HID ITS SENSE IN MYSTERIES OF HUE
YET GLADNESS EVER REPEATED THE SAME NOTES
AND GAVE THE SENSE OF AN ENDURING WORLD
THERE WAS A STRANGE CONSISTENCY OF SHAPES
AND THE SAME THOUGHTS WERE CONSTANT PASSERS-BY
AND ALL RENEWED UNENDINGLY ITS CHARM
ALLURING EVER THE EXPECTANT HEART
LIKE MUSIC THAT ONE ALWAYS WAITS TO HEAR
LIKE THE RECURRENCE OF A HAUNTING RHYME
ONE TOUCHED INCESSANTLY THINGS NEVER SEIZED
A SKIRT OF WORLDS INVISIBLY DIVINE
AS IF A TRAIL OF DISAPPEARING STARS
THERE SHOWERED UPON THE FLOATING ATMOSPHERE
COLOURS AND LIGHTS AND EVANESCENT GLEAMS
THAT CALLED TO FOLLOW INTO A MAGIC HEAVEN
AND IN EACH CRY THAT FAINTED ON THE EAR
THERE WAS THE VOICE OF AN UNREALISED BLISS
AN ADORATION REIGNED IN THE YEARNING HEART
A SPIRIT OF PURITY AN ELUSIVE PRESENCE
OF FAERY BEAUTY AND UNGRASPED DELIGHT
WHOSE MOMENTARY AND ESCAPING THRILL
HOWEVER UNSUBSTANTIAL TO OUR FLESH
AND BRIEF EVEN IN IMPERISHABLENESS
MUCH SWEETER SEEMED THAN ANY RAPTURE KNOWN
EARTH OR ALL-CONQUERING HEAVEN CAN EVER GIVE
HEAVEN EVER YOUNG AND EARTH TOO FIRM AND OLD
DELAY THE HEART BY IMMOBILITY
THEIR RAPTURES OF CREATION LAST TOO LONG
THEIR BOLD FORMATIONS ARE TOO ABSOLUTE
CARVED BY AN ANGUISH OF DIVINE ENDEAVOUR
THEY STAND UP SCULPTURED ON THE ETERNAL HILLS
604
OR QUARRIED FROM THE LIVING ROCKS OF GOD
WIN IMMORTALITY BY PERFECT FORM
THEY ARE TOO INTIMATE WITH ETERNAL THINGS
VESSELS OF INFINITE SIGNIFICANCES
THEY ARE TOO CLEAR TOO GREAT TOO MEANINGFUL
NO MIST OR SHADOW SOOTHES THE VANQUISHED SIGHT
NO SOFT PENUMBRA OF INCERTITUDE
THESE ONLY TOUCHED A GOLDEN HEM OF BLISS
THE GLEAMING SHOULDER OF SOME GODLIKE HOPE
THE FLYING FEET OF EXQUISITE DESIRES
ON A SLOW TREMBLING BRINK BETWEEN NIGHT AND DAY
THEY SHONE LIKE VISITANTS FROM THE MORNING STAR
SATISFIED BEGINNINGS OF PERFECTION FIRST
TREMULOUS IMAGININGS OF A HEAVENLY WORLD
THEY MINGLE IN A PASSION OF PURSUIT
THRILLED WITH A SPRAY OF JOY TOO SLIGHT TO TIRE
ALL IN THIS WORLD WAS SHADOWED FORTH NOT LIMNED
LIKE FACES LEAPING ON A FAN OF FIRE
OR SHAPES OF WONDER IN A TINTED BLUR
LIKE FUGITIVE LANDSCAPES PAINTING SILVER MISTS
HERE VISION FLED BACK FROM THE SIGHT ALARMED
AND SOUND SOUGHT REFUGE FROM THE EAR'S SURPRISE
AND ALL EXPERIENCE WAS A HASTY JOY
THE JOYS HERE SNATCHED WERE HALF-FORBIDDEN THINGS
TIMOROUS SOUL-BRIDALS DELICATELY VEILED
AS WHEN A GODDESS' BOSOM DIMLY MOVES
TO FIRST DESIRE AND HER WHITE SOUL TRANSFIGURED
A GLIMMERING EDEN CROSSED BY FAERY GLEAMS
TREMBLES TO EXPECTATION'S FIERY WAND
BUT NOTHING IS FAMILIAR YET WITH BLISS
ALL THINGS IN THIS FAIR REALM WERE HEAVENLY STRANGE
IN A FLEETING GLADNESS OF UNTIRED DELIGHT
IN AN INSISTENCY OF MAGIC CHANGE
PAST VANISHING HEDGES HURRYING HINTS OF FIELDS
MID SWIFT ESCAPING LANES THAT FLED HER FEET
JOURNEYING SHE WISHED NO END AS ONE THROUGH CLOUDS
605
TRAVELS UPON A MOUNTAIN RIDGE AND HEARS
ARISING TO HIM OUT OF HIDDEN DEPTHS
SOUND OF INVISIBLE STREAMS SHE WALKED BESIEGED
BY THE ILLUSION OF A MYSTIC SPACE
A CHARM OF BODILESS TOUCHES FELT AND HEARD
A SWEETNESS AS OF VOICES HIGH AND DIM
CALLING LIKE TRAVELLERS UPON SEEKING WINDS
MELODIOUSLY WITH AN ALLURING CRY
AS IF A MUSIC OLD YET EVER NEW
MOVING SUGGESTIONS ON HER HEART-STRINGS DWELT
THOUGHTS THAT NO HABITATION FOUND YET CLUNG
WITH PASSIONATE REPETITION TO HER MIND
DESIRES THAT HURT NOT HAPPY ONLY TO LIVE
ALWAYS THE SAME AND ALWAYS UNFULFILLED
SANG IN THE BREAST LIKE A CELESTIAL LYRE
THUS ALL COULD LAST YET NOTHING EVER BE
IN THIS BEAUTY AS OF MIND MADE VISIBLE
DRESSED IN ITS RAYS OF WONDER SATYAVAN
BEFORE HER SEEMED THE CENTRE OF ITS CHARM
HEAD OF HER LOVELINESS OF LONGING DREAMS
AND CAPTAIN OF THE FANCIES OF HER SOUL
EVEN THE DREADFUL MAJESTY OF DEATH'S FACE
AND ITS SOMBRE SADNESS COULD NOT DARKEN NOR SLAY
THE INTANGIBLE LUSTRE OF THOSE FLEETING SKIES
THE SOMBRE SHADOW SULLEN IMPLACABLE
MADE BEAUTY AND LAUGHTER MORE IMPERATIVE
ENHANCED BY HIS GREY JOY GREW MORE BRIGHT AND DEAR
HIS DARK CONTRAST EDGING IDEAL SIGHT
DEEPENED UNUTTERED MEANINGS TO THE HEART
PAIN GREW A TREMBLING UNDERTONE OF BLISS
AND TRANSIENCE IMMORTALITY'S FLOATING HEM
A MOMENT'S ROBE IN WHICH SHE LOOKED MORE FAIR
ITS ANTITHESIS SHARPENING HER DIVINITY
A COMRADE OF THE RAY AND MIST AND FLAME
BY A MOON-BRIGHT FACE A BRILLIANT MOMENT DRAWN
ALMOST SHE SEEMED A THOUGHT MID FLOATING THOUGHTS
606
SEEN HARDLY BY A VISIONARY MIND
AMID THE WHITE INWARD MUSINGS OF THE SOUL
HALF-VANQUISHED BY THE DREAM-HAPPINESS AROUND
AWHILE SHE MOVED ON AN ENCHANTMENT'S SOIL
BUT STILL REMAINED POSSESSOR OF HER SOUL
ABOVE HER SPIRIT IN ITS MIGHTY TRANCE
SAW ALL BUT LIVED FOR ITS TRANSCENDENT TASK
IMMUTABLE LIKE A FIXED ETERNAL STAR
607
THEN PEALED THE CALM INEXORABLE VOICE
ABOLISHING HOPE CANCELLING LIFE'S GOLDEN TRUTHS
FATAL ITS ACCENTS SMOTE THE TREMBLING AIR
THAT LOVELY WORLD SWAM THIN AND FRAIL MOST LIKE
SOME PEARLY EVANESCENT FAREWELL GLEAM
ON THE FAINT VERGE OF DUSK IN MOONLESS EVES
PRISONER OF NATURE MANY-VISIONED SPIRIT
THOUGHT'S CREATURE IN THE IDEAL'S REALM ENJOYING
THY UNSUBSTANTIAL IMMORTALITY
THE SUBTLE MARVELLOUS MIND OF MAN HAS FEIGNED
THIS IS THE WORLD FROM WHICH THY YEARNINGS CAME
WHEN IT WOULD BUILD ETERNITY FROM THE DUST
MAN'S THOUGHT PAINTS IMAGES ILLUSION ROUNDS
PROPHESYING GLORIES IT SHALL NEVER SEE
IT LABOURS DELICATELY AMONG ITS DREAMS
BEHOLD THIS FLEEING OF LIGHT-TASSELLED SHAPES
AERIAL RAIMENT OF UNBODIED GODS
A RAPTURE OF THINGS THAT NEVER CAN BE BORN
HOPE CHANTS TO HOPE A BRIGHT IMMORTAL CHOIR
CLOUD SATISFIES CLOUD PHANTOM TO LONGING PHANTOM
LEANS SWEETLY SWEETLY IS CLASPED OR SWEETLY CHASED
THIS IS THE STUFF FROM WHICH THE IDEAL IS FORMED
ITS BUILDER IS THOUGHT ITS BASE THE HEART'S DESIRE
BUT NOTHING REAL ANSWERS TO THEIR CALL
THE IDEAL DWELLS NOT IN HEAVEN NOR ON THE EARTH
A BRIGHT DELIRIUM OF MAN'S ARDOUR OF HOPE
DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF ITS OWN FANTASY
IT IS A BRILLIANT SHADOW'S DREAMY TRAIL
THY VISION'S ERROR BUILDS THE AZURE SKIES
THY VISION'S ERROR DREW THE RAINBOW'S ARCH
608
THY MORTAL LONGING MADE FOR THEE A SOUL
THIS ANGEL IN THY BODY THOU CALLST LOVE
WHO SHAPES HIS WINGS FROM THY EMOTION'S HUES
IN A FERMENT OF THY BODY HAS BEEN BORN
AND WITH THE BODY THAT HOUSED IT IT MUST DIE
IT IS A PASSION OF THY YEARNING CELLS
IT IS FLESH THAT CALLS TO FLESH TO SERVE ITS LUST
IT IS THY MIND THAT SEEKS AN ANSWERING MIND
AND DREAMS AWHILE THAT IT HAS FOUND ITS MATE
IT IS THY LIFE THAT ASKS A HUMAN PROP
TO UPHOLD ITS WEAKNESS LONELY IN THE WORLD
OR FEEDS ITS HUNGER ON ANOTHER'S LIFE
A BEAST OF PREY THAT PAUSES IN ITS PROWL
IT CROUCHES UNDER A BUSH IN SPLENDID FLOWER
TO SEIZE A HEART AND BODY FOR ITS FOOD
THIS BEAST THOU DREAMST IMMORTAL AND A GOD
O HUMAN MIND VAINLY THOU TORTUREST
AN HOUR'S DELIGHT TO STRETCH THROUGH INFINITY'S
LONG VOID AND FILL ITS FORMLESS PASSIONLESS GULFS
PERSUADING THE INSENSIBLE ABYSS
TO LEND ETERNITY TO PERISHING THINGS
AND TRICKST THE FRAGILE MOVEMENTS OF THY HEART
WITH THY SPIRIT'S FEINT OF IMMORTALITY
ALL HERE EMERGES BORN FROM NOTHINGNESS
ENCIRCLED IT LASTS BY THE EMPTINESS OF SPACE
AWHILE UPHELD BY AN UNKNOWING FORCE
THEN CRUMBLES BACK INTO ITS PARENT NOUGHT
ONLY THE MUTE ALONE CAN FOR EVER BE
IN THE ALONE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR LOVE
IN VAIN TO CLOTHE LOVE'S PERISHABLE MUD
THOU HAST WOVEN ON THE IMMORTALS' BORROWED LOOM
THE IDEAL'S GORGEOUS AND UNFADING ROBE
THE IDEAL NEVER YET WAS REAL MADE
IMPRISONED IN FORM THAT GLORY CANNOT LIVE
INTO A BODY SHUT IT BREATHES NO MORE
INTANGIBLE REMOTE FOR EVER PURE
609
A SOVEREIGN OF ITS OWN BRILLIANT VOID
UNWILLINGLY IT DESCENDS TO EARTHLY AIR
TO INHABIT A WHITE TEMPLE IN MAN'S HEART
IN HIS HEART IT SHINES REJECTED BY HIS LIFE
IMMUTABLE BODILESS BEAUTIFUL GRAND AND DUMB
IMMOBILE ON ITS SHINING THRONE IT SITS
DUMB IT RECEIVES HIS OFFERING AND HIS PRAYER
IT HAS NO VOICE TO ANSWER TO HIS CALL
NO FEET THAT MOVE NO HANDS TO TAKE HIS GIFTS
AERIAL STATUE OF THE NUDE IDEA
VIRGIN CONCEPTION OF A BODILESS GOD
ITS LIGHT STIRS MAN THE THINKER TO CREATE
AN EARTHLY SEMBLANCE OF DIVINER THINGS
ITS HUED REFLECTION FALLS UPON MAN'S ACTS
HIS INSTITUTIONS ARE ITS CENOTAPHS
HE SIGNS HIS DEAD CONVENTIONS WITH ITS NAME
HIS VIRTUES DON THE IDEAL'S SKIEY ROBE
AND A NIMBUS OF THE OUTLINE OF ITS FACE
HE HIDES THEIR LITTLENESS WITH THE DIVINE NAME
YET INSUFFICIENT IS THE BRIGHT PRETENCE
TO SCREEN THEIR INDIGENT AND EARTHY MAKE
EARTH ONLY IS THERE AND NOT SOME HEAVENLY SOURCE
IF HEAVENS THERE ARE THEY ARE VEILED IN THEIR OWN LIGHT
IF A TRUTH ETERNAL SOMEWHERE REIGNS UNKNOWN
IT BURNS IN A TREMENDOUS VOID OF GOD
FOR TRUTH SHINES FAR FROM THE FALSEHOODS OF THE WORLD
HOW CAN THE HEAVENS COME DOWN TO UNHAPPY EARTH
OR THE ETERNAL LODGE IN DRIFTING TIME
HOW SHALL THE IDEAL TREAD EARTH'S DOLOROUS SOIL
WHERE LIFE IS ONLY A LABOUR AND A HOPE
A CHILD OF MATTER AND BY MATTER FED
A FIRE FLAMING LOW IN NATURE'S GRATE
A WAVE THAT BREAKS UPON A SHORE IN TIME
A JOURNEY'S TOILSOME TRUDGE WITH DEATH FOR GOAL
THE AVATARS HAVE LIVED AND DIED IN VAIN
VAIN WAS THE SAGE'S THOUGHT THE PROPHET'S VOICE
610
IN VAIN IS SEEN THE SHINING UPWARD WAY
EARTH LIES UNCHANGED BENEATH THE CIRCLING SUN
SHE LOVES HER FALL AND NO OMNIPOTENCE
HER MORTAL IMPERFECTIONS CAN ERASE
FORCE ON MAN'S CROOKED IGNORANCE HEAVEN'S STRAIGHT LINE
OR COLONISE A WORLD OF DEATH WITH GODS
O TRAVELLER IN THE CHARIOT OF THE SUN
HIGH PRIESTESS IN THY HOLY FANCY'S SHRINE
WHO WITH A MAGIC RITUAL IN EARTH'S HOUSE
WORSHIPPEST IDEAL AND ETERNAL LOVE
WHAT IS THIS LOVE THY THOUGHT HAS DEIFIED
THIS SACRED LEGEND AND IMMORTAL MYTH
IT IS A CONSCIOUS YEARNING OF THY FLESH
IT IS A GLORIOUS BURNING OF THY NERVES
A ROSE OF DREAM-SPLENDOUR PETALLING THY MIND
A GREAT RED RAPTURE AND TORTURE OF THY HEART
A SUDDEN TRANSFIGURATION OF THY DAYS
IT PASSES AND THE WORLD IS AS BEFORE
A RAVISHING EDGE OF SWEETNESS AND OF PAIN
A THRILL IN ITS YEARNING MAKES IT SEEM DIVINE
A GOLDEN BRIDGE ACROSS THE ROAR OF THE YEARS
A CORD TYING THEE TO ETERNITY
AND YET HOW BRIEF AND FRAIL HOW SOON IS SPENT
THIS TREASURE WASTED BY THE GODS ON MAN
THIS HAPPY CLOSENESS AS OF SOUL TO SOUL
THIS HONEY OF THE BODY'S COMPANIONSHIP
THIS HEIGHTENED JOY THIS ECSTASY IN THE VEINS
THIS STRANGE ILLUMINATION OF THE SENSE
IF SATYAVAN HAD LIVED LOVE WOULD HAVE DIED
BUT SATYAVAN IS DEAD AND LOVE SHALL LIVE
A LITTLE WHILE IN THY SAD BREAST UNTIL
HIS FACE AND BODY FADE ON MEMORY'S WALL
WHERE OTHER BODIES OTHER FACES COME
WHEN LOVE BREAKS SUDDENLY INTO THE LIFE
AT FIRST MAN STEPS INTO A WORLD OF THE SUN
IN HIS PASSION HE FEELS HIS HEAVENLY ELEMENT
611
BUT ONLY A FINE SUNLIT PATCH OF EARTH
THE MARVELLOUS ASPECT TOOK OF HEAVEN'S OUTBURST
THE SNAKE IS THERE AND THE WORM IN THE HEART OF THE ROSE
A WORD A MOMENT'S ACT CAN SLAY THE GOD
PRECARIOUS IS HIS IMMORTALITY
HE HAS A THOUSAND WAYS TO SUFFER AND DIE
LOVE CANNOT LIVE BY HEAVENLY FOOD ALONE
ONLY ON SAP OF EARTH CAN IT SURVIVE
FOR THY PASSION WAS A SENSUAL WANT REFINED
A HUNGER OF THE BODY AND THE HEART
THY WANT CAN TIRE AND CEASE OR TURN ELSEWHERE
OR LOVE MAY MEET A DIRE AND PITILESS END
BY BITTER TREASON OR WRATH WITH CRUEL WOUNDS
SEPARATE OR THY UNSATISFIED WILL TO OTHERS
DEPART WHEN FIRST LOVE'S JOY LIES STRIPPED AND SLAIN
A DULL INDIFFERENCE REPLACES FIRE
OR AN ENDEARING HABIT IMITATES LOVE
AN OUTWARD AND UNEASY UNION LASTS
OR THE ROUTINE OF A LIFE'S COMPROMISE
WHERE ONCE THE SEED OF ONENESS HAD BEEN CAST
INTO A SEMBLANCE OF SPIRITUAL GROUND
BY A DIVINE ADVENTURE OF HEAVENLY POWERS
TWO STRIVE CONSTANT ASSOCIATES WITHOUT JOY
TWO EGOS STRAINING IN A SINGLE LEASH
TWO MINDS DIVIDED BY THEIR JARRING THOUGHTS
TWO SPIRITS DISJOINED FOR EVER SEPARATE
THUS IS THE IDEAL FALSIFIED IN MAN'S WORLD
TRIVIAL OR SOMBRE DISILLUSION COMES
LIFE'S HARSH REALITY STARES AT THE SOUL
HEAVEN'S HOUR ADJOURNED FLEES INTO BODILESS TIME
DEATH SAVES THEE FROM THIS AND SAVES SATYAVAN
HE NOW IS SAFE DELIVERED FROM HIMSELF
HE TRAVELS TO SILENCE AND FELICITY
CALL HIM NOT BACK TO THE TREACHERIES OF EARTH
AND THE POOR PETTY LIFE OF ANIMAL MAN
IN MY VAST TRANQUIL SPACES LET HIM SLEEP
612
IN HARMONY WITH THE MIGHTY HUSH OF DEATH
WHERE LOVE LIES SLUMBERING ON THE BREAST OF PEACE
AND THOU GO BACK ALONE TO THY FRAIL WORLD
CHASTISE THY HEART WITH KNOWLEDGE UNHOOD TO SEE
THY NATURE RAISED INTO CLEAR LIVING HEIGHTS
THE HEAVEN-BIRD'S VIEW FROM UNIMAGINED PEAKS
FOR WHEN THOU GIVEST THY SPIRIT TO A DREAM
SOON HARD NECESSITY WILL SMITE THEE AWAKE
PUREST DELIGHT BEGAN AND IT MUST END
THOU TOO SHALT KNOW THY HEART NO ANCHOR SWINGING
THY CRADLED SOUL MOORED IN ETERNAL SEAS
VAIN ARE THE CYCLES OF THY BRILLIANT MIND
RENOUNCE FORGETTING JOY AND HOPE AND TEARS
THY PASSIONATE NATURE IN THE BOSOM PROFOUND
OF A HAPPY NOTHINGNESS AND WORLDLESS CALM
DELIVERED INTO MY MYSTERIOUS REST
ONE WITH MY FATHOMLESS NIHIL ALL FORGET
FORGET THY FRUITLESS SPIRIT'S WASTE OF FORCE
FORGET THE WEARY CIRCLE OF THY BIRTH
FORGET THE JOY AND THE STRUGGLE AND THE PAIN
THE VAGUE SPIRITUAL QUEST WHICH FIRST BEGAN
WHEN WORLDS BROKE FORTH LIKE CLUSTERS OF FIRE-FLOWERS
AND GREAT BURNING THOUGHTS VOYAGED THROUGH THE SKY OF MIND
AND TIME AND ITS AEONS CRAWLED ACROSS THE VASTS
AND SOULS EMERGED INTO MORTALITY
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO THE DARK POWER
A DANGEROUS MUSIC NOW THOU FINDST O DEATH
MELTING THY SPEECH INTO HARMONIOUS PAIN
AND FLUT'ST ALLURINGLY TO TIRED HOPES
THY FALSEHOODS MINGLED WITH SAD STRAINS OF TRUTH
BUT I FORBID THY VOICE TO SLAY MY SOUL
MY LOVE IS NOT A HUNGER OF THE HEART
MY LOVE IS NOT A CRAVING OF THE FLESH
IT CAME TO ME FROM GOD TO GOD RETURNS
EVEN IN ALL THAT LIFE AND MAN HAVE MARRED
A WHISPER OF DIVINITY STILL IS HEARD
613
A BREATH IS FELT FROM THE ETERNAL SPHERES
ALLOWED BY HEAVEN AND WONDERFUL TO MAN
A SWEET FIRE-RHYTHM OF PASSION CHANTS TO LOVE
THERE IS A HOPE IN ITS WILD INFINITE CRY
IT RINGS WITH CALLINGS FROM FORGOTTEN HEIGHTS
AND WHEN ITS STRAINS ARE HUSHED TO HIGH-WINGED SOULS
IN THEIR EMPYREAN ITS BURNING BREATH
SURVIVES BEYOND THE RAPTUROUS CORE OF SUNS
THAT FLAME FOR EVER PURE IN SKIES UNSEEN
A VOICE OF THE ETERNAL ECSTASY
ONE DAY I SHALL BEHOLD MY GREAT SWEET WORLD
PUT OFF THE DIRE DISGUISES OF THE GODS
UNVEIL FROM TERROR AND DISROBE FROM SIN
APPEASED WE SHALL DRAW NEAR OUR MOTHER'S FACE
WE SHALL CAST OUR CANDID SOULS UPON HER LAP
THEN SHALL WE CLASP THE ECSTASY WE CHASE
THEN SHALL WE SHUDDER WITH THE LONG-SOUGHT GOD
THEN SHALL WE FIND HEAVEN'S UNEXPECTED STRAIN
NOT ONLY IS THERE HOPE FOR GODHEADS PURE
THE VIOLENT AND DARKENED DEITIES
LEAPED DOWN FROM THE ONE BREAST IN RAGE TO FIND
WHAT THE WHITE GODS HAD MISSED THEY TOO ARE SAFE
A MOTHER'S EYES ARE ON THEM AND HER ARMS
STRETCHED OUT IN LOVE DESIRE HER REBEL SONS
ONE WHO CAME LOVE AND LOVER AND BELOVED
ETERNAL BUILT HIMSELF A WONDROUS FIELD
AND WOVE THE MEASURES OF A MARVELLOUS DANCE
THERE IN ITS CIRCLES AND ITS MAGIC TURNS
ATTRACTED HE ARRIVES REPELLED HE FLEES
IN THE WILD DEVIOUS PROMPTINGS OF HIS MIND
HE TASTES THE HONEY OF TEARS AND PUTS OFF JOY
REPENTING AND HAS LAUGHTER AND HAS WRATH
AND BOTH ARE A BROKEN MUSIC OF THE SOUL
WHICH SEEKS OUT RECONCILED ITS HEAVENLY RHYME
EVER HE COMES TO US ACROSS THE YEARS
BEARING A NEW SWEET FACE THAT IS THE OLD
614
HIS BLISS LAUGHS TO US OR IT CALLS CONCEALED
LIKE A FAR-HEARD UNSEEN ENTRANCING FLUTE
FROM MOONLIT BRANCHES IN THE THROBBING WOODS
TEMPTING OUR ANGRY SEARCH AND PASSIONATE PAIN
DISGUISED THE LOVER SEEKS AND DRAWS OUR SOULS
HE NAMED HIMSELF FOR ME GREW SATYAVAN
FOR WE WERE MAN AND WOMAN FROM THE FIRST
THE TWIN SOULS BORN FROM ONE UNDYING FIRE
DID HE NOT DAWN ON ME IN OTHER STARS
HOW HAS HE THROUGH THE THICKETS OF THE WORLD
PURSUED ME LIKE A LION IN THE NIGHT
AND COME UPON ME SUDDENLY IN THE WAYS
AND SEIZED ME WITH HIS GLORIOUS GOLDEN LEAP
UNSATISFIED HE YEARNED FOR ME THROUGH TIME
SOMETIMES WITH WRATH AND SOMETIMES WITH SWEET PEACE
DESIRING ME SINCE FIRST THE WORLD BEGAN
HE ROSE LIKE A WILD WAVE OUT OF THE FLOODS
AND DRAGGED ME HELPLESS INTO SEAS OF BLISS
OUT OF MY CURTAINED PAST HIS ARMS ARRIVE
THEY HAVE TOUCHED ME LIKE THE SOFT PERSUADING WIND
THEY HAVE PLUCKED ME LIKE A GLAD AND TREMBLING FLOWER
AND CLASPED ME HAPPILY BURNED IN RUTHLESS FLAME
I TOO HAVE FOUND HIM CHARMED IN LOVELY FORMS
AND RUN DELIGHTED TO HIS DISTANT VOICE
AND PRESSED TO HIM PAST MANY DREADFUL BARS
IF THERE IS A YET HAPPIER GREATER GOD
LET HIM FIRST WEAR THE FACE OF SATYAVAN
AND LET HIS SOUL BE ONE WITH HIM I LOVE
SO LET HIM SEEK ME THAT I MAY DESIRE
FOR ONLY ONE HEART BEATS WITHIN MY BREAST
AND ONE GOD SITS THERE THRONED ADVANCE O DEATH
BEYOND THE PHANTOM BEAUTY OF THIS WORLD
FOR OF ITS CITIZENS I AM NOT ONE
I CHERISH GOD THE FIRE NOT GOD THE DREAM
BUT DEATH ONCE MORE INFLICTED ON HER HEART
THE MAJESTY OF HIS CALM AND DREADFUL VOICE
615
A BRIGHT HALLUCINATION ARE THY THOUGHTS
A PRISONER HALED BY A SPIRITUAL CORD
OF THY OWN SENSUOUS WILL THE ARDENT SLAVE
THOU SENDEST EAGLE-POISED TO MEET THE SUN
WORDS WINGED WITH THE RED SPLENDOUR OF THY HEART
BUT KNOWLEDGE DWELLS NOT IN THE PASSIONATE HEART
THE HEART'S WORDS FALL BACK UNHEARD FROM WISDOM'S THRONE
VAIN IS THY LONGING TO BUILD HEAVEN ON EARTH
ARTIFICER OF IDEAL AND IDEA
MIND CHILD OF MATTER IN THE WOMB OF LIFE
TO HIGHER LEVELS PERSUADES HIS PARENTS' STEPS
INAPT THEY FOLLOW ILL THE DARING GUIDE
BUT MIND A GLORIOUS TRAVELLER IN THE SKY
WALKS LAMELY ON THE EARTH WITH FOOTSTEPS SLOW
HARDLY HE CAN MOULD THE LIFE'S REBELLIOUS STUFF
HARDLY CAN HE HOLD THE GALLOPING HOOVES OF SENSE
HIS THOUGHTS LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE VERY HEAVENS
THEY DRAW THEIR GOLD FROM A CELESTIAL MINE
HIS ACTS WORK PAINFULLY A COMMON ORE
ALL THY HIGH DREAMS WERE MADE BY MATTER'S MIND
TO SOLACE ITS DULL WORK IN MATTER'S JAIL
ITS ONLY HOUSE WHERE IT ALONE SEEMS TRUE
A SOLID IMAGE OF REALITY
CARVED OUT OF BEING TO PROP THE WORKS OF TIME
MATTER ON THE FIRM EARTH SITS STRONG AND SURE
IT IS THE FIRST-BORN OF CREATED THINGS
IT STANDS THE LAST WHEN MIND AND LIFE ARE SLAIN
AND IF IT ENDED ALL WOULD CEASE TO BE
ALL ELSE IS ONLY ITS OUTCOME OR ITS PHASE
THY SOUL IS A BRIEF FLOWER BY THE GARDENER MIND
CREATED IN THY MATTER'S TERRAIN PLOT
IT PERISHES WITH THE PLANT ON WHICH IT GROWS
FOR FROM EARTH'S SAP IT DRAWS ITS HEAVENLY HUE
THY THOUGHTS ARE GLEAMS THAT PASS ON MATTER'S VERGE
THY LIFE A LAPSING WAVE ON MATTER'S SEA
A CAREFUL STEWARD OF TRUTH'S LIMITED MEANS
616
TREASURING HER FOUNDED FACTS FROM THE SQUANDERING POWER
IT TETHERS MIND TO THE TENT-POSTS OF SENSE
TO A LEADEN GREY ROUTINE CLAMPS LIFE'S CAPRICE
AND TIES ALL CREATURES WITH THE CORDS OF LAW
A VESSEL OF TRANSMUTING ALCHEMIES
A GLUE THAT STICKS TOGETHER MIND AND LIFE
IF MATTER FAILS ALL CRUMBLING CRACKS AND FALLS
ALL UPON MATTER STANDS AS ON A ROCK
YET THIS SECURITY AND GUARANTOR
PRESSED FOR CREDENTIALS AN IMPOSTOR PROVES
A CHEAT OF SUBSTANCE WHERE NO SUBSTANCE IS
AN APPEARANCE AND A SYMBOL AND A NOUGHT
ITS FORMS HAVE NO ORIGINAL RIGHT TO BIRTH
ITS ASPECT OF A FIXED STABILITY
IS THE COVER OF A CAPTIVE MOTION'S SWIRL
AN ORDER OF THE STEPS OF ENERGY'S DANCE
WHOSE FOOTMARKS LEAVE FOR EVER THE SAME SIGNS
A CONCRETE FACE OF UNSUBSTANTIAL TIME
A TRICKLE DOTTING THE EMPTINESS OF SPACE
A STABLE-SEEMING MOVEMENT WITHOUT CHANGE
YET CHANGE ARRIVES AND THE LAST CHANGE IS DEATH
WHAT SEEMED MOST REAL ONCE IS NIHIL'S SHOW
ITS FIGURES ARE SNARES THAT TRAP AND PRISON THE SENSE
THE BEGINNINGLESS VOID WAS ITS ARTIFICER
NOTHING IS THERE BUT ASPECTS LIMNED BY CHANCE
AND SEEMING SHAPES OF SEEMING ENERGY
ALL BY DEATH'S MERCY BREATHE AND LIVE AWHILE
ALL THINK AND ACT BY THE INCONSCIENT'S GRACE
ADDICT OF THE ROSEATE LUXURY OF THY THOUGHTS
TURN NOT THY GAZE WITHIN THYSELF TO LOOK
AT VISIONS IN THE GLEAMING CRYSTAL MIND
CLOSE NOT THY LIDS TO DREAM THE FORMS OF GODS
AT LAST TO OPEN THY EYES CONSENT AND SEE
THE STUFF OF WHICH THOU AND THE WORLD ARE MADE
INCONSCIENT IN THE DUMB INCONSCIENT VOID
INEXPLICABLY A MOVING WORLD SPRANG FORTH
617
AWHILE SECURE HAPPILY INSENSIBLE
IT COULD NOT REST CONTENT WITH ITS OWN TRUTH
FOR SOMETHING ON ITS NESCIENT BREAST WAS BORN
CONDEMNED TO SEE AND KNOW TO FEEL AND LOVE
IT WATCHED ITS ACTS IMAGINED A SOUL WITHIN
IT GROPED FOR TRUTH AND DREAMED OF SELF AND GOD
WHEN ALL UNCONSCIOUS WAS THEN ALL WAS WELL
I DEATH WAS KING AND KEPT MY REGAL STATE
DESIGNING MY UNWILLED UNERRING PLAN
CREATING WITH A CALM INSENTIENT HEART
IN MY SOVEREIGN POWER OF UNREALITY
OBLIGING NOTHINGNESS TO TAKE A FORM
INFALLIBLY MY BLIND UNTHINKING FORCE
MAKING BY CHANCE A FIXITY LIKE FATE'S
BY WHIM THE FORMULAS OF NECESSITY
FOUNDED ON THE HOLLOW GROUND OF THE INANE
THE SURE BIZARRERIE OF NATURE'S SCHEME
I CURVED THE VACANT ETHER INTO SPACE
A HUGE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING BREATH
HARBOURED THE FIRES OF THE UNIVERSE
I STRUCK OUT THE SUPREME ORIGINAL SPARK
AND SPREAD ITS SPARSE RANKED ARMIES THROUGH THE INANE
MANUFACTURED THE STARS FROM THE OCCULT RADIANCES
MARSHALLED THE PLATOONS OF THE INVISIBLE DANCE
I FORMED EARTH'S BEAUTY OUT OF ATOM AND GAS
AND BUILT FROM CHEMIC PLASM THE LIVING MAN
THEN THOUGHT CAME IN AND SPOILED THE HARMONIOUS WORLD
MATTER BEGAN TO HOPE AND THINK AND FEEL
TISSUE AND NERVE BORE JOY AND AGONY
THE INCONSCIENT COSMOS STROVE TO LEARN ITS TASK
AN IGNORANT PERSONAL GOD WAS BORN IN MIND
AND TO UNDERSTAND INVENTED REASON'S LAW
THE IMPERSONAL VAST THROBBED BACK TO MAN'S DESIRE
A TROUBLE ROCKED THE GREAT WORLD'S BLIND STILL HEART
AND NATURE LOST HER WIDE IMMORTAL CALM
THUS CAME THIS WARPED INCOMPREHENSIBLE SCENE
618
OF SOULS EMMESHED IN LIFE'S DELIGHT AND PAIN
AND MATTER'S SLEEP AND MIND'S MORTALITY
OF BEINGS IN NATURE'S PRISON WAITING DEATH
AND CONSCIOUSNESS LEFT IN SEEKING IGNORANCE
AND EVOLUTION'S SLOW ARRESTED PLAN
THIS IS THE WORLD IN WHICH THOU MOV'ST ASTRAY
IN THE TANGLED PATHWAYS OF THE HUMAN MIND
IN THE ISSUELESS CIRCLING OF THY HUMAN LIFE
SEARCHING FOR THY SOUL AND THINKING GOD IS HERE
BUT WHERE IS ROOM FOR SOUL OR PLACE FOR GOD
IN THE BRUTE IMMENSITY OF A MACHINE
A TRANSIENT BREATH THOU TAKEST FOR THY SOUL
BORN FROM A GAS A PLASM A SPERM A GENE
A MAGNIFIED IMAGE OF MAN'S MIND FOR GOD
A SHADOW OF THYSELF THROWN UPON SPACE
INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE UPPER AND NETHER VOID
THY CONSCIOUSNESS REFLECTS THE WORLD AROUND
IN THE DISTORTING MIRROR OF IGNORANCE
OR UPWARDS TURNS TO CATCH IMAGINED STARS
OR IF A HALF-TRUTH IS PLAYING WITH THE EARTH
THROWING ITS LIGHT ON A DARK SHADOWY GROUND
IT TOUCHES ONLY AND LEAVES A LUMINOUS SMUDGE
IMMORTALITY THOU CLAIMEST FOR THY SPIRIT
BUT IMMORTALITY FOR IMPERFECT MAN
A GOD WHO HURTS HIMSELF AT EVERY STEP
WOULD BE A CYCLE OF ETERNAL PAIN
WISDOM AND LOVE THOU CLAIMEST AS THY RIGHT
BUT KNOWLEDGE IN THIS WORLD IS ERROR'S MATE
A BRILLIANT PROCURESS OF NESCIENCE
AND HUMAN LOVE A POSTURER ON EARTH-STAGE
WHO IMITATES WITH VERVE A FAERY DANCE
AN EXTRACT PRESSED FROM HARD EXPERIENCE
MAN'S KNOWLEDGE CASKED IN THE BARRELS OF MEMORY
HAS THE HARSH SAVOUR OF A MORTAL DRAUGHT
A SWEET SECRETION FROM THE EROTIC GLANDS
FLATTERING AND TORTURING THE BURNING NERVES
619
LOVE IS A HONEY AND POISON IN THE BREAST
DRUNK BY IT AS THE NECTAR OF THE GODS
EARTH'S HUMAN WISDOM IS NO GREAT-BROWED POWER
AND LOVE NO GLEAMING ANGEL FROM THE SKIES
IF THEY ASPIRE BEYOND EARTH'S DULLARD AIR
ARRIVING SUNWARDS WITH FRAIL WAXEN WINGS
HOW HIGH COULD REACH THAT FORCED UNNATURAL FLIGHT
BUT NOT ON EARTH CAN DIVINE WISDOM REIGN
AND NOT ON EARTH CAN DIVINE LOVE BE FOUND
HEAVEN-BORN ONLY IN HEAVEN CAN THEY LIVE
OR ELSE THERE TOO PERHAPS THEY ARE SHINING DREAMS
NAY IS NOT ALL THOU ART AND DOEST A DREAM
THY MIND AND LIFE ARE TRICKS OF MATTER'S FORCE
IF THY MIND SEEMS TO THEE A RADIANT SUN
IF THY LIFE RUNS A SWIFT AND GLORIOUS STREAM
THIS IS THE ILLUSION OF THY MORTAL HEART
DAZZLED BY A RAY OF HAPPINESS OR LIGHT
IMPOTENT TO LIVE BY THEIR OWN RIGHT DIVINE
CONVINCED OF THEIR BRILLIANT UNREALITY
WHEN THEIR SUPPORTING GROUND IS CUT AWAY
THESE CHILDREN OF MATTER INTO MATTER DIE
EVEN MATTER VANISHES INTO ENERGY'S VAGUE
AND ENERGY IS A MOTION OF OLD NOUGHT
HOW SHALL THE IDEAL'S UNSUBSTANTIAL HUES
BE PAINTED STIFF ON EARTH'S VERMILION BLUR
A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM COME DOUBLY TRUE
HOW SHALL THE WILL-O'-THE-WISP BECOME A STAR
THE IDEAL IS A MALADY OF THY MIND
A BRIGHT DELIRIUM OF THY SPEECH AND THOUGHT
A STRANGE WINE OF BEAUTY LIFTING THEE TO FALSE SIGHT
A NOBLE FICTION OF THY YEARNINGS MADE
THY HUMAN IMPERFECTION IT MUST SHARE
ITS FORMS IN NATURE DISAPPOINT THE HEART
AND NEVER SHALL IT FIND ITS HEAVENLY SHAPE
AND NEVER CAN IT BE FULFILLED IN TIME
O SOUL MISLED BY THE SPLENDOUR OF THY THOUGHTS
620
O EARTHLY CREATURE WITH THY DREAM OF HEAVEN
OBEY RESIGNED AND STILL THE EARTHLY LAW
ACCEPT THE BRIEF LIGHT THAT FALLS UPON THY DAYS
TAKE WHAT THOU CANST OF LIFE'S PERMITTED JOY
SUBMITTING TO THE ORDEAL OF FATE'S SCOURGE
SUFFER WHAT THOU MUST OF TOIL AND GRIEF AND CARE
THERE SHALL APPROACH SILENCING THY PASSIONATE HEART
MY LONG CALM NIGHT OF EVERLASTING SLEEP
THERE INTO THE HUSH FROM WHICH THOU CAM'ST RETIRE
621
A SAD DESTROYING CADENCE THE VOICE SANK
IT SEEMED TO LEAD THE ADVANCING MARCH OF LIFE
INTO SOME STILL ORIGINAL INANE
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED TO ALMIGHTY DEATH
O DARK-BROWED SOPHIST OF THE UNIVERSE
WHO VEILST THE REAL WITH ITS OWN IDEA
HIDING WITH BRUTE OBJECTS NATURE'S LIVING FACE
MASKING ETERNITY WITH THY DANCE OF DEATH
THOU HAST WOVEN THE IGNORANT MIND INTO A SCREEN
AND MADE OF THOUGHT ERROR'S PURVEYOR AND SCRIBE
AND A FALSE WITNESS OF MIND'S SERVANT SENSE
AN AESTHETE OF THE SORROW OF THE WORLD
CHAMPION OF A HARSH AND SAD PHILOSOPHY
THOU HAST USED WORDS TO SHUTTER OUT THE LIGHT
AND CALLED IN TRUTH TO VINDICATE A LIE
A LYING REALITY IS FALSEHOOD'S CROWN
AND A PERVERTED TRUTH HER RICHEST GEM
O DEATH THOU SPEAKEST TRUTH BUT TRUTH THAT SLAYS
I ANSWER TO THEE WITH THE TRUTH THAT SAVES
A TRAVELLER NEW-DISCOVERING HIMSELF
ONE MADE OF MATTER'S WORLD HIS STARTING-POINT
HE MADE OF NOTHINGNESS HIS LIVING-ROOM
AND NIGHT A PROCESS OF THE ETERNAL LIGHT
AND DEATH A SPUR TOWARDS IMMORTALITY
GOD WRAPPED HIS HEAD FROM SIGHT IN MATTER'S COWL
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS DIVED INTO INCONSCIENT DEPTHS
ALL-KNOWLEDGE SEEMED A HUGE DARK NESCIENCE
INFINITY WORE A BOUNDLESS ZERO'S FORM
HIS ABYSMS OF BLISS BECAME INSENSIBLE DEEPS
ETERNITY A BLANK SPIRITUAL VAST
ANNULLING AN ORIGINAL NULLITY
622
THE TIMELESS TOOK ITS GROUND IN EMPTINESS
AND DREW THE FIGURE OF A UNIVERSE
THAT THE SPIRIT MIGHT ADVENTURE INTO TIME
AND WRESTLE WITH ADAMANT NECESSITY
AND THE SOUL PURSUE A COSMIC PILGRIMAGE
A SPIRIT MOVED IN BLACK IMMENSITIES
AND BUILT A THOUGHT IN ANCIENT NOTHINGNESS
A SOUL WAS LIT IN GOD'S TREMENDOUS VOID
A SECRET LABOURING GLOW OF NASCENT FIRE
IN NIHIL'S GULF HIS MIGHTY PUISSANCE WROUGHT
SHE SWUNG HER FORMLESS MOTION INTO SHAPES
MADE MATTER THE BODY OF THE BODILESS
INFANT AND DIM THE ETERNAL MIGHTS AWOKE
IN INERT MATTER BREATHED A SLUMBERING LIFE
IN A SUBCONSCIENT LIFE MIND LAY ASLEEP
IN WAKING LIFE IT STRETCHED ITS GIANT LIMBS
TO SHAKE FROM IT THE TORPOR OF ITS DROWSE
A SENSELESS SUBSTANCE QUIVERED INTO SENSE
THE WORLD'S HEART COMMENCED TO BEAT ITS EYES TO SEE
IN THE CROWDED DUMB VIBRATIONS OF A BRAIN
THOUGHT FUMBLED IN A RING TO FIND ITSELF
DISCOVERED SPEECH AND FED THE NEW-BORN WORD
THAT BRIDGED WITH SPANS OF LIGHT THE WORLD'S IGNORANCE
IN WAKING MIND THE THINKER BUILT HIS HOUSE
A REASONING ANIMAL WILLED AND PLANNED AND SOUGHT
HE STOOD ERECT AMONG HIS BRUTE COMPEERS
HE BUILT LIFE NEW MEASURED THE UNIVERSE
OPPOSED HIS FATE AND WRESTLED WITH UNSEEN POWERS
CONQUERED AND USED THE LAWS THAT RULE THE WORLD
AND HOPED TO RIDE THE HEAVENS AND REACH THE STARS
A MASTER OF HIS HUGE ENVIRONMENT
NOW THROUGH MIND'S WINDOWS STARES THE DEMIGOD
HIDDEN BEHIND THE CURTAINS OF MAN'S SOUL
HE HAS SEEN THE UNKNOWN LOOKED ON TRUTH'S VEILLESS FACE
A RAY HAS TOUCHED HIM FROM THE ETERNAL SUN
MOTIONLESS VOICELESS IN FORESEEING DEPTHS
623
HE STANDS AWAKE IN SUPERNATURE'S LIGHT
AND SEES A GLORY OF ARISEN WINGS
AND SEES THE VAST DESCENDING MIGHT OF GOD
O DEATH THOU LOOKST ON AN UNFINISHED WORLD
ASSAILED BY THEE AND OF ITS ROAD UNSURE
PEOPLED BY IMPERFECT MINDS AND IGNORANT LIVES
AND SAYEST GOD IS NOT AND ALL IS VAIN
HOW SHALL THE CHILD ALREADY BE THE MAN
BECAUSE HE IS INFANT SHALL HE NEVER GROW
BECAUSE HE IS IGNORANT SHALL HE NEVER LEARN
IN A SMALL FRAGILE SEED A GREAT TREE LURKS
IN A TINY GENE A THINKING BEING IS SHUT
A LITTLE ELEMENT IN A LITTLE SPERM
IT GROWS AND IS A CONQUEROR AND A SAGE
THEN WILT THOU SPEW OUT DEATH GOD'S MYSTIC TRUTH
DENY THE OCCULT SPIRITUAL MIRACLE
STILL WILT THOU SAY THERE IS NO SPIRIT NO GOD
A MUTE MATERIAL NATURE WAKES AND SEES
SHE HAS INVENTED SPEECH UNVEILED A WILL
SOMETHING THERE WAITS BEYOND TOWARDS WHICH SHE STRIVES
SOMETHING SURROUNDS HER INTO WHICH SHE GROWS
TO UNCOVER THE SPIRIT TO CHANGE BACK INTO GOD
TO EXCEED HERSELF IS HER TRANSCENDENT TASK
IN GOD CONCEALED THE WORLD BEGAN TO BE
TARDILY IT TRAVELS TOWARDS MANIFEST GOD
OUR IMPERFECTION TOWARDS PERFECTION TOILS
THE BODY IS THE CHRYSALIS OF A SOUL
THE INFINITE HOLDS THE FINITE IN ITS ARMS
TIME TRAVELS TOWARDS REVEALED ETERNITY
A MIRACLE STRUCTURE OF THE ETERNAL MAGE
MATTER ITS MYSTERY HIDES FROM ITS OWN EYES
A SCRIPTURE WRITTEN OUT IN CRYPTIC SIGNS
AN OCCULT DOCUMENT OF THE ALL-WONDERFUL'S ART
ALL HERE BEARS WITNESS TO HIS SECRET MIGHT
IN ALL WE FEEL HIS PRESENCE AND HIS POWER
A BLAZE OF HIS SOVEREIGN GLORY IS THE SUN
624
A GLORY IS THE GOLD AND GLIMMERING MOON
A GLORY IS HIS DREAM OF PURPLE SKY
A MARCH OF HIS GREATNESS ARE THE WHEELING STARS
HIS LAUGHTER OF BEAUTY BREAKS OUT IN GREEN TREES
HIS MOMENTS OF BEAUTY TRIUMPH IN A FLOWER
THE BLUE SEA'S CHANT THE RIVULET'S WANDERING VOICE
ARE MURMURS FALLING FROM THE ETERNAL'S HARP
THIS WORLD IS GOD FULFILLED IN OUTWARDNESS
HIS WAYS CHALLENGE OUR REASON AND OUR SENSE
BY BLIND BRUTE MOVEMENTS OF AN IGNORANT FORCE
BY MEANS WE SLIGHT AS SMALL OBSCURE OR BASE
A GREATNESS FOUNDED UPON LITTLE THINGS
HE HAS BUILT A WORLD IN THE UNKNOWING VOID
HIS FORMS HE HAS MASSED FROM INFINITESIMAL DUST
HIS MARVELS ARE BUILT FROM INSIGNIFICANT THINGS
IF MIND IS CRIPPLED LIFE UNTAUGHT AND CRUDE
IF BRUTAL MASKS ARE THERE AND EVIL ACTS
THEY ARE INCIDENTS OF HIS VAST AND VARIED PLOT
HIS GREAT AND DANGEROUS DRAMA'S NEEDED STEPS
HE MAKES WITH THESE AND ALL HIS PASSION-PLAY
A PLAY AND YET NO PLAY BUT THE DEEP SCHEME
OF A TRANSCENDENT WISDOM FINDING WAYS
TO MEET HER LORD IN THE SHADOW AND THE NIGHT
ABOVE HER IS THE VIGIL OF THE STARS
WATCHED BY A SOLITARY INFINITUDE
SHE EMBODIES IN DUMB MATTER THE DIVINE
IN SYMBOL MINDS AND LIVES THE ABSOLUTE
A MIRACLE-MONGER HER MECHANICAL CRAFT
MATTER'S MACHINE WORKED OUT THE LAWS OF THOUGHT
LIFE'S ENGINES SERVED THE LABOUR OF A SOUL
THE MIGHTY MOTHER HER CREATION WROUGHT
A HUGE CAPRICE SELF-BOUND BY IRON LAWS
AND SHUT GOD INTO AN ENIGMATIC WORLD
SHE LULLED THE OMNISCIENT INTO NESCIENT SLEEP
OMNIPOTENCE ON INERTIA'S BACK SHE DROVE
TROD PERFECTLY WITH DIVINE UNCONSCIOUS STEPS
625
THE ENORMOUS CIRCLE OF HER WONDER-WORKS
IMMORTALITY ASSURED ITSELF BY DEATH
THE ETERNAL'S FACE WAS SEEN THROUGH DRIFTS OF TIME
HIS KNOWLEDGE HE DISGUISED AS IGNORANCE
HIS GOOD HE SOWED IN EVIL'S MONSTROUS BED
MADE ERROR A DOOR BY WHICH TRUTH COULD ENTER IN
HIS PLANT OF BLISS WATERED WITH SORROW'S TEARS
A THOUSAND ASPECTS POINT BACK TO THE ONE
A DUAL NATURE COVERED THE UNIQUE
IN THIS MEETING OF THE ETERNAL'S MINGLING MASQUES
THIS TANGLE-DANCE OF PASSIONATE CONTRARIES
LOCKING LIKE LOVERS IN A FORBIDDEN EMBRACE
THE QUARREL OF THEIR LOST IDENTITY
THROUGH THIS WRESTLE AND WRANGLE OF THE EXTREMES OF POWER
EARTH'S MILLION ROADS STRUGGLED TOWARDS DEITY
ALL STUMBLED ON BEHIND A STUMBLING GUIDE
YET EVERY STUMBLE IS A NEEDED PACE
ON UNKNOWN ROUTES TO AN UNKNOWABLE GOAL
ALL BLUNDERED AND STRAGGLED TOWARDS THE ONE DIVINE
AS IF TRANSMUTED BY A TITAN SPELL
THE ETERNAL POWERS ASSUMED A DUBIOUS FACE
IDOLS OF AN OBLIQUE DIVINITY
THEY WORE THE HEADS OF ANIMAL OR TROLL
ASSUMED EARS OF THE FAUN THE SATYR'S HOOF
OR HARBOURED THE DEMONIAC IN THEIR GAZE
A CROOKED MAZE THEY MADE OF THINKING MIND
THEY SUFFERED A METAMORPHOSIS OF THE HEART
ADMITTING BACCHANT REVELLERS FROM THE NIGHT
INTO ITS SANCTUARY OF DELIGHTS
AS IN A DIONYSIAN MASQUERADE
ON THE HIGHWAYS IN THE GARDENS OF THE WORLD
THEY WALLOWED OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR DIVINE PARTS
AS DRUNKARDS OF A DIRE CIRCEAN WINE
OR A CHILD WHO SPRAWLS AND SPORTS IN NATURE'S MIRE
EVEN WISDOM HEWER OF THE ROADS OF GOD
IS A PARTNER IN THE DEEP DISASTROUS GAME
626
LOST IS THE PILGRIM'S WALLET AND THE SCRIP
SHE FAILS TO READ THE MAP AND WATCH THE STAR
A POOR SELF-RIGHTEOUS VIRTUE IS HER STOCK
AND REASON'S PRAGMATIC GROPE OR ABSTRACT SIGHT
OR THE TECHNIQUE OF A BRIEF HOUR'S SUCCESS
SHE TEACHES AN USHER IN UTILITY'S SCHOOL
ON THE OCEAN SURFACE OF VAST CONSCIOUSNESS
SMALL THOUGHTS IN SHOALS ARE FISHED UP INTO A NET
BUT THE GREAT TRUTHS ESCAPE HER NARROW CAST
GUARDED FROM VISION BY CREATION'S DEPTHS
OBSCURE THEY SWIM IN BLIND ENORMOUS GULFS
SAFE FROM THE LITTLE SOUNDING LEADS OF MIND
TOO FAR FOR THE PUNY DIVER'S SHALLOW PLUNGE
OUR MORTAL VISION PEERS WITH IGNORANT EYES
IT HAS NO GAZE ON THE DEEP HEART OF THINGS
OUR KNOWLEDGE WALKS LEANING ON ERROR'S STAFF
A WORSHIPPER OF FALSE DOGMAS AND FALSE GODS
OR FANATIC OF A FIERCE INTOLERANT CREED
OR A SEEKER DOUBTING EVERY TRUTH HE FINDS
A SCEPTIC FACING LIGHT WITH ADAMANT NO
OR CHILLING THE HEART WITH DRY IRONIC SMILE
A CYNIC STAMPING OUT THE GOD IN MAN
A DARKNESS WALLOWS IN THE PATHS OF TIME
OR LIFTS ITS GIANT HEAD TO BLOT THE STARS
IT MAKES A CLOUD OF THE INTERPRETING MIND
AND INTERCEPTS THE ORACLES OF THE SUN
YET LIGHT IS THERE IT STANDS AT NATURE'S DOORS
IT HOLDS A TORCH TO LEAD THE TRAVELLER IN
IT WAITS TO BE KINDLED IN OUR SECRET CELLS
IT IS A STAR LIGHTING AN IGNORANT SEA
A LAMP UPON OUR POOP PIERCING THE NIGHT
AS KNOWLEDGE GROWS LIGHT FLAMES UP FROM WITHIN
IT IS A SHINING WARRIOR IN THE MIND
AN EAGLE OF DREAMS IN THE DIVINING HEART
AN ARMOUR IN THE FIGHT A BOW OF GOD
THEN LARGER DAWNS ARRIVE AND WISDOM'S POMPS
627
CROSS THROUGH THE BEING'S DIM HALF-LIGHTED FIELDS
PHILOSOPHY CLIMBS UP THOUGHT'S CLOUD-BANK PEAKS
AND SCIENCE TEARS OUT NATURE'S OCCULT POWERS
ENORMOUS DJINNS WHO SERVE A DWARF'S SMALL NEEDS
EXPOSES THE SEALED MINUTIAE OF HER ART
AND CONQUERS HER BY HER OWN CAPTIVE FORCE
ON HEIGHTS UNREACHED BY MIND'S MOST DARING SOAR
UPON A DANGEROUS EDGE OF FAILING TIME
THE SOUL DRAWS BACK INTO ITS DEATHLESS SELF
MAN'S KNOWLEDGE BECOMES GOD'S SUPERNAL RAY
THERE IS THE MYSTIC REALM WHENCE LEAPS THE POWER
WHOSE FIRE BURNS IN THE EYES OF SEER AND SAGE
A LIGHTNING FLASH OF VISIONARY SIGHT
IT PLAYS UPON AN INWARD VERGE OF MIND
THOUGHT SILENCED GAZES INTO A BRILLIANT VOID
A VOICE COMES DOWN FROM MYSTIC UNSEEN PEAKS
A CRY OF SPLENDOUR FROM A MOUTH OF STORM
IT IS THE VOICE THAT SPEAKS TO NIGHT'S PROFOUND
IT IS THE THUNDER AND THE FLAMING CALL
ABOVE THE PLANES THAT CLIMB FROM NESCIENT EARTH
A HAND IS LIFTED TOWARDS THE INVISIBLE'S REALM
BEYOND THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S BLINDING LINE
AND PLUCKS AWAY THE SCREENS OF THE UNKNOWN
A SPIRIT WITHIN LOOKS INTO THE ETERNAL'S EYES
IT HEARS THE WORD TO WHICH OUR HEARTS WERE DEAF
IT SEES THROUGH THE BLAZE IN WHICH OUR THOUGHTS GREW BLIND
IT DRINKS FROM THE NAKED BREASTS OF GLORIOUS TRUTH
IT LEARNS THE SECRETS OF ETERNITY
THUS ALL WAS PLUNGED INTO THE RIDDLING NIGHT
THUS ALL IS RAISED TO MEET A DAZZLING SUN
O DEATH THIS IS THE MYSTERY OF THY REIGN
IN EARTH'S ANOMALOUS AND MAGIC FIELD
CARRIED IN ITS AIMLESS JOURNEY BY THE SUN
MID THE FORCED MARCHES OF THE GREAT DUMB STARS
A DARKNESS OCCUPIED THE FIELDS OF GOD
AND MATTER'S WORLD WAS GOVERNED BY THY SHAPE
628
THY MASK HAS COVERED THE ETERNAL'S FACE
THE BLISS THAT MADE THE WORLD HAS FALLEN ASLEEP
ABANDONED IN THE VAST SHE SLUMBERED ON
AN EVIL TRANSMUTATION OVERTOOK
HER MEMBERS TILL SHE KNEW HERSELF NO MORE
ONLY THROUGH HER CREATIVE SLUMBER FLIT
FRAIL MEMORIES OF THE JOY AND BEAUTY MEANT
UNDER THE SKY'S BLUE LAUGH MID GREEN-SCARFED TREES
AND HAPPY SQUANDERINGS OF SCENTS AND HUES
IN THE FIELD OF THE GOLDEN PROMENADE OF THE SUN
AND THE VIGIL OF THE DREAM-LIGHT OF THE STARS
AMID HIGH MEDITATING HEADS OF HILLS
ON THE BOSOM OF VOLUPTUOUS RAIN-KISSED EARTH
AND BY THE SAPPHIRE TUMBLINGS OF THE SEA
BUT NOW THE PRIMAL INNOCENCE IS LOST
AND DEATH AND IGNORANCE GOVERN THE MORTAL WORLD
AND NATURE'S VISAGE WEARS A GREYER HUE
EARTH STILL HAS KEPT HER EARLY CHARM AND GRACE
THE GRANDEUR AND THE BEAUTY STILL ARE HERS
BUT VEILED IS THE DIVINE INHABITANT
THE SOULS OF MEN HAVE WANDERED FROM THE LIGHT
AND THE GREAT MOTHER TURNS AWAY HER FACE
THE EYES OF THE CREATRIX BLISS ARE CLOSED
AND SORROW'S TOUCH HAS FOUND HER IN HER DREAMS
AS SHE TURNS AND TOSSES ON HER BED OF VOID
BECAUSE SHE CANNOT WAKE AND FIND HERSELF
AND CANNOT BUILD AGAIN HER PERFECT SHAPE
OBLIVIOUS OF HER NATURE AND HER STATE
FORGETTING HER INSTINCT OF FELICITY
FORGETTING TO CREATE A WORLD OF JOY
SHE WEEPS AND MAKES HER CREATURES' EYES TO WEEP
TESTING WITH SORROW'S EDGE HER CHILDREN'S BREASTS
SHE SPENDS ON LIFE'S VAIN WASTE OF HOPE AND TOIL
THE POIGNANT LUXURY OF GRIEF AND TEARS
IN THE NIGHTMARE CHANGE OF HER HALF-CONSCIOUS DREAM
TORTURED HERSELF AND TORTURING BY HER TOUCH
629
SHE COMES TO OUR HEARTS AND BODIES AND OUR LIVES
WEARING A HARD AND CRUEL MASK OF PAIN
OUR NATURE TWISTED BY THE ABORTIVE BIRTH
RETURNS WRY ANSWERS TO LIFE'S QUESTIONING SHOCKS
AN ACRID RELISH FINDS IN THE WORLD'S PANGS
DRINKS THE SHARP WINE OF GRIEF'S PERVERSITY
A CURSE IS LAID ON THE PURE JOY OF LIFE
DELIGHT GOD'S SWEETEST SIGN AND BEAUTY'S TWIN
DREADED BY ASPIRING SAINT AND AUSTERE SAGE
IS SHUNNED A DANGEROUS AND AMBIGUOUS CHEAT
A SPECIOUS TRICK OF AN INFERNAL POWER
IT TEMPTS THE SOUL TO ITS SELF-HURT AND FALL
A PURITAN GOD MADE PLEASURE A POISONOUS FRUIT
OR RED DRUG IN THE MARKET-PLACE OF DEATH
AND SIN THE CHILD OF NATURE'S ECSTASY
YET EVERY CREATURE HUNTS FOR HAPPINESS
BUYS WITH HARSH PANGS OR TEARS BY VIOLENCE
FROM THE DULL BREAST OF THE INANIMATE GLOBE
SOME FRAGMENT OR SOME BROKEN SHARD OF BLISS
EVEN JOY ITSELF BECOMES A POISONOUS DRAUGHT
ITS HUNGER IS MADE A DREADFUL HOOK OF FATE
ALL MEANS ARE HELD GOOD TO CATCH A SINGLE BEAM
ETERNITY SACRIFICED FOR A MOMENT'S BLISS
YET FOR JOY AND NOT FOR SORROW EARTH WAS MADE
AND NOT AS A DREAM IN ENDLESS SUFFERING TIME
ALTHOUGH GOD MADE THE WORLD FOR HIS DELIGHT
AN IGNORANT POWER TOOK CHARGE AND SEEMED HIS WILL
AND DEATH'S DEEP FALSITY HAS MASTERED LIFE
ALL GREW A PLAY OF CHANCE SIMULATING FATE
A SECRET AIR OF PURE FELICITY
DEEP LIKE A SAPPHIRE HEAVEN OUR SPIRITS BREATHE
OUR HEARTS AND BODIES FEEL ITS OBSCURE CALL
OUR SENSES GROPE FOR IT AND TOUCH AND LOSE
IF THIS WITHDREW THE WORLD WOULD SINK IN THE VOID
IF THIS WERE NOT NOTHING COULD MOVE OR LIVE
630
A HIDDEN BLISS IS AT THE ROOT OF THINGS
A MUTE DELIGHT REGARDS TIME'S COUNTLESS WORKS
TO HOUSE GOD'S JOY IN THINGS SPACE GAVE WIDE ROOM
TO HOUSE GOD'S JOY IN SELF OUR SOULS WERE BORN
THIS UNIVERSE AN OLD ENCHANTMENT GUARDS
ITS OBJECTS ARE CARVED CUPS OF WORLD-DELIGHT
WHOSE CHARMED WINE IS SOME DEEP SOUL'S RAPTURE-DRINK
THE ALL-WONDERFUL HAS PACKED HEAVEN WITH HIS DREAMS
HE HAS MADE BLANK ANCIENT SPACE HIS MARVEL-HOUSE
HE SPILLED HIS SPIRIT INTO MATTER'S SIGNS
HIS FIRES OF GRANDEUR BURN IN THE GREAT SUN
HE GLIDES THROUGH HEAVEN SHIMMERING IN THE MOON
HE IS BEAUTY CAROLLING IN THE FIELDS OF SOUND
HE CHANTS THE STANZAS OF THE ODES OF WIND
HE IS SILENCE WATCHING IN THE STARS AT NIGHT
HE WAKES AT DAWN AND CALLS FROM EVERY BOUGH
LIES STUNNED IN THE STONE AND DREAMS IN FLOWER AND TREE
EVEN IN THIS LABOUR AND DOLOUR OF IGNORANCE
ON THE HARD PERILOUS GROUND OF DIFFICULT EARTH
IN SPITE OF DEATH AND EVIL CIRCUMSTANCE
A WILL TO LIVE PERSISTS A JOY TO BE
THERE IS A JOY IN ALL THAT MEETS THE SENSE
A JOY IN ALL EXPERIENCE OF THE SOUL
A JOY IN EVIL AND A JOY IN GOOD
A JOY IN VIRTUE AND A JOY IN SIN
INDIFFERENT TO THE THREAT OF KARMIC LAW
JOY DARES TO GROW UPON FORBIDDEN SOIL
ITS SAP RUNS THROUGH THE PLANT AND FLOWERS OF PAIN
IT THRILLS WITH THE DRAMA OF FATE AND TRAGIC DOOM
IT TEARS ITS FOOD FROM SORROW AND ECSTASY
ON DANGER AND DIFFICULTY WHETS ITS STRENGTH
IT WALLOWS WITH THE REPTILE AND THE WORM
AND LIFTS ITS HEAD AN EQUAL OF THE STARS
IT SHARES THE FAERIES' DANCE DINES WITH THE GNOME
IT BASKS IN THE LIGHT AND HEAT OF MANY SUNS
THE SUN OF BEAUTY AND THE SUN OF POWER
631
FLATTER AND FOSTER IT WITH GOLDEN BEAMS
IT GROWS TOWARDS THE TITAN AND THE GOD
ON EARTH IT LINGERS DRINKING ITS DEEP FILL
THROUGH THE SYMBOL OF HER PLEASURE AND HER PAIN
OF THE GRAPES OF HEAVEN AND THE FLOWERS OF THE ABYSS
OF THE FLAME-STABS AND THE TORMENT-CRAFT OF HELL
AND DIM FRAGMENTS OF THE GLORY OF PARADISE
IN THE SMALL PALTRY PLEASURES OF MAN'S LIFE
IN HIS PETTY PASSIONS AND JOYS IT FINDS A TASTE
A TASTE IN TEARS AND TORTURE OF BROKEN HEARTS
IN THE CROWN OF GOLD AND IN THE CROWN OF THORNS
IN LIFE'S NECTAR OF SWEETNESS AND ITS BITTER WINE
ALL BEING IT EXPLORES FOR UNKNOWN BLISS
SOUNDS ALL EXPERIENCE FOR THINGS NEW AND STRANGE
LIFE BRINGS INTO THE EARTHLY CREATURE'S DAYS
A TONGUE OF GLORY FROM A BRIGHTER SPHERE
IT DEEPENS IN HIS MUSINGS AND HIS ART
IT LEAPS AT THE SPLENDOUR OF SOME PERFECT WORD
IT EXULTS IN HIS HIGH RESOLVES AND NOBLE DEEDS
WANDERS IN HIS ERRORS DARES THE ABYSS'S BRINK
IT CLIMBS IN HIS CLIMBINGS WALLOWS IN HIS FALL
ANGEL AND DEMON BRIDES HIS CHAMBER SHARE
POSSESSORS OR COMPETITORS FOR LIFE'S HEART
TO THE ENJOYER OF THE COSMIC SCENE
HIS GREATNESS AND HIS LITTLENESS EQUAL ARE
HIS MAGNANIMITY AND MEANNESS HUES
CAST ON SOME NEUTRAL BACKGROUND OF THE GODS
THE ARTIST'S SKILL HE ADMIRES WHO PLANNED IT ALL
BUT NOT FOR EVER ENDURES THIS DANGER GAME
BEYOND THE EARTH BUT MEANT FOR DELIVERED EARTH
WISDOM AND JOY PREPARE THEIR PERFECT CROWN
TRUTH SUPERHUMAN CALLS TO THINKING MAN
AT LAST THE SOUL TURNS TO ETERNAL THINGS
IN EVERY SHRINE IT CRIES FOR THE CLASP OF GOD
THEN IS THERE PLAYED THE CROWNING MYSTERY
THEN IS ACHIEVED THE LONGED-FOR MIRACLE
632
IMMORTAL BLISS HER WIDE CELESTIAL EYES
OPENS ON THE STARS SHE STIRS HER MIGHTY LIMBS
TIME THRILLS TO THE SAPPHICS OF HER AMOUR-SONG
AND SPACE FILLS WITH A WHITE BEATITUDE
THEN LEAVING TO ITS GRIEF THE HUMAN HEART
ABANDONING SPEECH AND THE NAME-DETERMINED REALMS
THROUGH A GLEAMING FAR-SEEN SKY OF WORDLESS THOUGHT
THROUGH NAKED THOUGHT-FREE HEAVENS OF ABSOLUTE SIGHT
SHE CLIMBS TO THE SUMMITS WHERE THE UNBORN IDEA
REMEMBERING THE FUTURE THAT MUST BE
LOOKS DOWN UPON THE WORKS OF LABOURING FORCE
IMMUTABLE ABOVE THE WORLD IT MADE
IN THE VAST GOLDEN LAUGHTER OF TRUTH'S SUN
LIKE A GREAT HEAVEN-BIRD ON A MOTIONLESS SEA
IS POISED HER WINGED ARDOUR OF CREATIVE JOY
ON THE STILL DEEP OF THE ETERNAL'S PEACE
THIS WAS THE AIM THIS THE SUPERNAL LAW
NATURE'S ALLOTTED TASK WHEN BEAUTY-DRENCHED
IN DIM MIST-WATERS OF INCONSCIENT SLEEP
OUT OF THE VOID THIS GRAND CREATION ROSE
FOR THIS THE SPIRIT CAME INTO THE ABYSS
AND CHARGED WITH ITS POWER MATTER'S UNKNOWING FORCE
IN NIGHT'S BARE SESSION TO CATHEDRAL LIGHT
IN DEATH'S REALM REPATRIATE IMMORTALITY
A MYSTIC SLOW TRANSFIGURATION WORKS
ALL OUR EARTH STARTS FROM MUD AND ENDS IN SKY
AND LOVE THAT WAS ONCE AN ANIMAL'S DESIRE
THEN A SWEET MADNESS IN THE RAPTUROUS HEART
AN ARDENT COMRADESHIP IN THE HAPPY MIND
BECOMES A WIDE SPIRITUAL YEARNING'S SPACE
A LONELY SOUL PASSIONS FOR THE ALONE
THE HEART THAT LOVED MAN THRILLS TO THE LOVE OF GOD
A BODY IS HIS CHAMBER AND HIS SHRINE
THEN IS OUR BEING RESCUED FROM SEPARATENESS
ALL IS ITSELF ALL IS NEW-FELT IN GOD
A LOVER LEANING FROM HIS CLOISTER'S DOOR
633
GATHERS THE WHOLE WORLD INTO HIS SINGLE BREAST
THEN SHALL THE BUSINESS FAIL OF NIGHT AND DEATH
WHEN UNITY IS WON WHEN STRIFE IS LOST
AND ALL IS KNOWN AND ALL IS CLASPED BY LOVE
WHO WOULD TURN BACK TO IGNORANCE AND PAIN
O DEATH I HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER THEE WITHIN
I QUIVER NO MORE WITH THE ASSAULT OF GRIEF
A MIGHTY CALMNESS SEATED DEEP WITHIN
HAS OCCUPIED MY BODY AND MY SENSE
IT TAKES THE WORLD'S GRIEF AND TRANSMUTES TO STRENGTH
IT MAKES THE WORLD'S JOY ONE WITH THE JOY OF GOD
MY LOVE ETERNAL SITS THRONED ON GOD'S CALM
FOR LOVE MUST SOAR BEYOND THE VERY HEAVENS
AND FIND ITS SECRET SENSE INEFFABLE
IT MUST CHANGE ITS HUMAN WAYS TO WAYS DIVINE
YET KEEP ITS SOVEREIGNTY OF EARTHLY BLISS
O DEATH NOT FOR MY HEART'S SWEET POIGNANCY
NOR FOR MY HAPPY BODY'S BLISS ALONE
I HAVE CLAIMED FROM THEE THE LIVING SATYAVAN
BUT FOR HIS WORK AND MINE OUR SACRED CHARGE
OUR LIVES ARE GOD'S MESSENGERS BENEATH THE STARS
TO DWELL UNDER DEATH'S SHADOW THEY HAVE COME
TEMPTING GOD'S LIGHT TO EARTH FOR THE IGNORANT RACE
HIS LOVE TO FILL THE HOLLOW IN MEN'S HEARTS
HIS BLISS TO HEAL THE UNHAPPINESS OF THE WORLD
FOR I THE WOMAN AM THE FORCE OF GOD
HE THE ETERNAL'S DELEGATE SOUL IN MAN
MY WILL IS GREATER THAN THY LAW O DEATH
MY LOVE IS STRONGER THAN THE BONDS OF FATE
OUR LOVE IS THE HEAVENLY SEAL OF THE SUPREME
I GUARD THAT SEAL AGAINST THY RENDING HANDS
LOVE MUST NOT CEASE TO LIVE UPON THE EARTH
FOR LOVE IS THE BRIGHT LINK TWIXT EARTH AND HEAVEN
LOVE IS THE FAR TRANSCENDENT'S ANGEL HERE
LOVE IS MAN'S LIEN ON THE ABSOLUTE
BUT TO THE WOMAN DEATH THE GOD REPLIED
634
WITH THE IRONIC LAUGHTER OF HIS VOICE
DISCOURAGING THE LABOUR OF THE STARS
EVEN SO MEN CHEAT THE TRUTH WITH SPLENDID THOUGHTS
THUS WILT THOU HIRE THE GLORIOUS CHARLATAN MIND
TO WEAVE FROM HIS IDEAL'S GOSSAMER AIR
A FINE RAIMENT FOR THY BODY'S NUDE DESIRES
AND THY HEART'S CLUTCHING GREEDY PASSION CLOTHE
DAUB NOT THE WEB OF LIFE WITH MAGIC HUES
MAKE RATHER THY THOUGHT A PLAIN AND FAITHFUL GLASS
REFLECTING MATTER AND MORTALITY
AND KNOW THY SOUL A PRODUCT OF THE FLESH
A MADE-UP SELF IN A CONSTRUCTED WORLD
THY WORDS ARE LARGE MURMURS IN A MYSTIC DREAM
FOR HOW IN THE SOILED HEART OF MAN COULD DWELL
THE IMMACULATE GRANDEUR OF THY DREAM-BUILT GOD
OR WHO CAN SEE A FACE AND FORM DIVINE
IN THE NAKED TWO-LEGGED WORM THOU CALLEST MAN
O HUMAN FACE PUT OFF MIND-PAINTED MASKS
THE ANIMAL BE THE WORM THAT NATURE MEANT
ACCEPT THY FUTILE BIRTH THY NARROW LIFE
FOR TRUTH IS BARE LIKE STONE AND HARD LIKE DEATH
BARE IN THE BARENESS HARD WITH TRUTH'S HARDNESS LIVE
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO THE DIRE GOD
YES I AM HUMAN YET SHALL MAN BY ME
SINCE IN HUMANITY WAITS HIS HOUR THE GOD
TRAMPLE THEE DOWN TO REACH THE IMMORTAL HEIGHTS
TRANSCENDING GRIEF AND PAIN AND FATE AND DEATH
YES MY HUMANITY IS A MASK OF GOD
HE DWELLS IN ME THE MOVER OF MY ACTS
TURNING THE GREAT WHEEL OF HIS COSMIC WORK
I AM THE LIVING BODY OF HIS LIGHT
I AM THE THINKING INSTRUMENT OF HIS POWER
I INCARNATE WISDOM IN AN EARTHLY BREAST
I AM HIS CONQUERING AND UNSLAYABLE WILL
THE FORMLESS SPIRIT DREW IN ME ITS SHAPE
IN ME ARE THE NAMELESS AND THE SECRET NAME
635
DEATH FROM THE INCREDULOUS DARKNESS SENT ITS CRY
O PRIESTESS IN IMAGINATION'S HOUSE
PERSUADE FIRST NATURE'S FIXED IMMUTABLE LAWS
AND MAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE THY DAILY WORK
HOW CANST THOU FORCE TO WED TWO ETERNAL FOES
IRRECONCILABLE IN THEIR EMBRACE
THEY CANCEL THE GLORY OF THEIR PURE EXTREMES
AN UNHAPPY WEDLOCK MAIMS THEIR STUNTED FORCE
HOW SHALL THY WILL MAKE ONE THE TRUE AND FALSE
WHERE MATTER IS ALL THERE SPIRIT IS A DREAM
IF ALL ARE THE SPIRIT MATTER IS A LIE
AND WHO WAS THE LIAR WHO FORGED THE UNIVERSE
THE REAL WITH THE UNREAL CANNOT MATE
HE WHO WOULD TURN TO GOD MUST LEAVE THE WORLD
HE WHO WOULD LIVE IN THE SPIRIT MUST GIVE UP LIFE
HE WHO HAS MET THE SELF RENOUNCES SELF
THE VOYAGERS OF THE MILLION ROUTES OF MIND
WHO HAVE TRAVELLED THROUGH EXISTENCE TO ITS END
SAGES EXPLORING THE WORLD-OCEAN'S VASTS
HAVE FOUND EXTINCTION THE SOLE HARBOUR SAFE
TWO ONLY ARE THE DOORS OF MAN'S ESCAPE
DEATH OF HIS BODY MATTER'S GATE TO PEACE
DEATH OF HIS SOUL HIS LAST FELICITY
IN ME ALL TAKE REFUGE FOR I DEATH AM GOD
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO MIGHTY DEATH
MY HEART IS WISER THAN THE REASON'S THOUGHTS
MY HEART IS STRONGER THAN THY BONDS O DEATH
IT SEES AND FEELS THE ONE HEART BEAT IN ALL
IT FEELS THE HIGH TRANSCENDENT'S SUNLIKE HANDS
IT SEES THE COSMIC SPIRIT AT ITS WORK
IN THE DIM NIGHT IT LIES ALONE WITH GOD
MY HEART'S STRENGTH CAN CARRY THE GRIEF OF THE UNIVERSE
AND NEVER FALTER FROM ITS LUMINOUS TRACK
ITS WHITE TREMENDOUS ORBIT THROUGH GOD'S PEACE
IT CAN DRINK UP THE SEA OF ALL-DELIGHT
AND NEVER LOSE THE WHITE SPIRITUAL TOUCH
636
THE CALM THAT BROODS IN THE DEEP INFINITE
HE SAID ART THOU INDEED SO STRONG O HEART
O SOUL SO FREE AND CANST THOU GATHER THEN
BRIGHT PLEASURE FROM MY WAYSIDE FLOWERING BOUGHS
YET FALTER NOT FROM THY HARD JOURNEY'S GOAL
MEET THE WORLD'S DANGEROUS TOUCH AND NEVER FALL
SHOW ME THY STRENGTH AND FREEDOM FROM MY LAWS
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED SURELY I SHALL FIND
AMONG THE GREEN AND WHISPERING WOODS OF LIFE
CLOSE-BOSOMED PLEASURES ONLY MINE SINCE HIS
OR MINE FOR HIM BECAUSE OUR JOYS ARE ONE
AND IF I LINGER TIME IS OURS AND GOD'S
AND IF I FALL IS NOT HIS HAND NEAR MINE
ALL IS A SINGLE PLAN EACH WAYSIDE ACT
DEEPENS THE SOUL'S RESPONSE BRINGS NEARER THE GOAL
DEATH THE CONTEMPTUOUS NIHIL ANSWERED HER
SO PROVE THY ABSOLUTE FORCE TO THE WISE GODS
BY CHOOSING EARTHLY JOY FOR SELF DEMAND
AND YET FROM SELF AND ITS GROSS MASKS LIVE FREE
THEN WILL I GIVE THEE ALL THY SOUL DESIRES
ALL THE BRIEF JOYS EARTH KEEPS FOR MORTAL HEARTS
ONLY THE ONE DEAREST WISH THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL
HARD LAWS FORBID AND THY IRONIC FATE
MY WILL ONCE WROUGHT REMAINS UNCHANGED THROUGH TIME
AND SATYAVAN CAN NEVER AGAIN BE THINE
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO THE VAGUE POWER
IF THE EYES OF DARKNESS CAN LOOK STRAIGHT AT TRUTH
LOOK IN MY HEART AND KNOWING WHAT I AM
GIVE WHAT THOU WILT OR WHAT THOU MUST O DEATH
NOTHING I CLAIM BUT SATYAVAN ALONE
THERE WAS A HUSH AS IF OF DOUBTFUL FATES
AS ONE DISDAINFUL STILL WHO YIELDS A POINT
DEATH BOWED HIS SOVEREIGN HEAD IN COLD ASSENT
I GIVE TO THEE SAVED FROM DEATH AND POIGNANT FATE
WHATEVER ONCE THE LIVING SATYAVAN
DESIRED IN HIS HEART FOR SAVITRI
637
BRIGHT NOONS I GIVE THEE AND UNWOUNDED DAWNS
DAUGHTERS OF THY OWN SHAPE IN HEART AND MIND
FAIR HERO SONS AND SWEETNESS UNDISTURBED
OF UNION WITH THY HUSBAND DEAR AND TRUE
AND THOU SHALT HARVEST IN THY JOYFUL HOUSE
FELICITY OF THY SURROUNDED EVES
LOVE SHALL BIND BY THEE MANY GATHERED HEARTS
THE OPPOSITE SWEETNESS IN THY DAYS SHALL MEET
OF TENDER SERVICE TO THY LIFE'S DESIRED
AND LOVING EMPIRE OVER ALL THY LOVED
TWO POLES OF BLISS MADE ONE O SAVITRI
RETURN O CHILD TO THY FORSAKEN EARTH
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED THY GIFTS RESIST
EARTH CANNOT FLOWER IF LONELY I RETURN
THEN DEATH SENT FORTH ONCE MORE HIS ANGRY CRY
AS CHIDES A LION HIS ESCAPING PREY
WHAT KNOWST THOU OF EARTH'S RICH AND CHANGING LIFE
WHO THINKST THAT ONE MAN DEAD ALL JOY MUST CEASE
HOPE NOT TO BE UNHAPPY TILL THE END
FOR GRIEF DIES SOON IN THE TIRED HUMAN HEART
SOON OTHER GUESTS THE EMPTY CHAMBERS FILL
A TRANSIENT PAINTING ON A HOLIDAY'S FLOOR
TRACED FOR A MOMENT'S BEAUTY LOVE WAS MADE
OR IF A VOYAGER ON THE ETERNAL TRAIL
ITS OBJECTS FLUENT CHANGE IN ITS EMBRACE
LIKE WAVES TO A SWIMMER UPON INFINITE SEAS
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO THE VAGUE GOD
GIVE ME BACK SATYAVAN MY ONLY LORD
THY THOUGHTS ARE VACANT TO MY SOUL THAT FEELS
THE DEEP ETERNAL TRUTH IN TRANSIENT THINGS
DEATH ANSWERED HER RETURN AND TRY THY SOUL
SOON SHALT THOU FIND APPEASED THAT OTHER MEN
ON LAVISH EARTH HAVE BEAUTY STRENGTH AND TRUTH
AND WHEN THOU HAST HALF FORGOTTEN ONE OF THESE
SHALL WIND HIMSELF AROUND THY HEART THAT NEEDS
SOME HUMAN ANSWERING HEART AGAINST THY BREAST
638
FOR WHO BEING MORTAL CAN DWELL GLAD ALONE
THEN SATYAVAN SHALL GLIDE INTO THE PAST
A GENTLE MEMORY PUSHED AWAY FROM THEE
BY NEW LOVE AND THY CHILDREN'S TENDER HANDS
TILL THOU SHALT WONDER IF THOU LOV'DST AT ALL
SUCH IS THE LIFE EARTH'S TRAVAIL HAS CONCEIVED
A CONSTANT STREAM THAT NEVER IS THE SAME
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO MIGHTY DEATH
O DARK IRONIC CRITIC OF GOD'S WORK
THOU MOCKST THE MIND AND BODY'S FALTERING SEARCH
FOR WHAT THE HEART HOLDS IN A PROPHET HOUR
AND THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT SHALL MAKE ITS OWN
MINE IS A HEART THAT WORSHIPPED THOUGH FORSAKEN
THE IMAGE OF THE GOD ITS LOVE ADORED
I HAVE BURNED IN FLAME TO TRAVEL IN HIS STEPS
ARE WE NOT THEY WHO BORE VAST SOLITUDE
SEATED UPON THE HILLS ALONE WITH GOD
WHY DOST THOU VAINLY STRIVE WITH ME O DEATH
A MIND DELIVERED FROM ALL TWILIGHT THOUGHTS
TO WHOM THE SECRETS OF THE GODS ARE PLAIN
FOR NOW AT LAST I KNOW BEYOND ALL DOUBT
THE GREAT STARS BURN WITH MY UNCEASING FIRE
AND LIFE AND DEATH ARE BOTH ITS FUEL MADE
LIFE ONLY WAS MY BLIND ATTEMPT TO LOVE
EARTH SAW MY STRUGGLE HEAVEN MY VICTORY
ALL SHALL BE SEIZED TRANSCENDED THERE SHALL KISS
CASTING THEIR VEILS BEFORE THE MARRIAGE FIRE
THE ETERNAL BRIDEGROOM AND ETERNAL BRIDE
THE HEAVENS ACCEPT OUR BROKEN FLIGHTS AT LAST
ON OUR LIFE'S PROW THAT BREAKS THE WAVES OF TIME
NO SIGNAL LIGHT OF HOPE HAS GLEAMED IN VAIN
SHE SPOKE THE BOUNDLESS MEMBERS OF THE GOD
AS IF BY SECRET ECSTASY ASSAILED
SHUDDERED IN SILENCE AS OBSCURELY STIR
OCEAN'S DIM FIELDS DELIVERED TO THE MOON
THEN LIFTED UP AS BY A SUDDEN WIND
639
AROUND HER IN THAT VAGUE AND GLIMMERING WORLD
THE TWILIGHT TREMBLED LIKE A BURSTING VEIL
THUS WITH ARMED SPEECH THE GREAT OPPONENTS STROVE
AROUND THOSE SPIRITS IN THE GLITTERING MIST
A DEEPENING HALF-LIGHT FLED WITH PEARLY WINGS
AS IF TO REACH SOME FAR IDEAL MORN
OUTLINED HER THOUGHTS FLEW THROUGH THE GLEAMING HAZE
MINGLING BRIGHT-PINIONED WITH ITS LIGHTS AND VEILS
AND ALL HER WORDS LIKE DAZZLING JEWELS WERE CAUGHT
INTO THE GLOW OF A MYSTERIOUS WORLD
OR TRICKED IN THE RAINBOW SHIFTING OF ITS HUES
LIKE ECHOES SWAM FAINTING INTO FAR SOUND
ALL UTTERANCE ALL MOOD MUST THERE BECOME
AN UNENDURING TISSUE SEWN BY MIND
TO MAKE A GOSSAMER ROBE OF BEAUTIFUL CHANGE
INTENT UPON HER SILENT WILL SHE WALKED
ON THE DIM GRASS OF VAGUE UNREAL PLAINS
A FLOATING VEIL OF VISIONS IN HER FRONT
A TRAILING ROBE OF DREAMS BEHIND HER FEET
BUT NOW HER SPIRIT'S FLAME OF CONSCIENT FORCE
RETIRING FROM A SWEETNESS WITHOUT FRUIT
CALLED BACK HER THOUGHTS FROM SPEECH TO SIT WITHIN
IN A DEEP ROOM IN MEDITATION'S HOUSE
FOR ONLY THERE COULD DWELL THE SOUL'S FIRM TRUTH
IMPERISHABLE A TONGUE OF SACRIFICE
IT FLAMED UNQUENCHED UPON THE CENTRAL HEARTH
WHERE BURNS FOR THE HIGH HOUSELORD AND HIS MATE
THE HOMESTEAD'S SENTINEL AND WITNESS FIRE
FROM WHICH THE ALTARS OF THE GODS ARE LIT
ALL STILL COMPELLED WENT GLIDING ON UNCHANGED
STILL WAS THE ORDER OF THESE WORLDS REVERSED
THE MORTAL LED THE GOD AND SPIRIT OBEYED
AND SHE BEHIND WAS LEADER OF THEIR MARCH
AND THEY IN FRONT WERE FOLLOWERS OF HER WILL
ONWARD THEY JOURNEYED THROUGH THE DRIFTING WAYS
VAGUELY COMPANIONED BY THE GLIMMERING MISTS
640
BUT FASTER NOW ALL FLED AS IF PERTURBED
ESCAPING FROM THE CLEARNESS OF HER SOUL
A HEAVEN-BIRD UPON JEWELLED WINGS OF WIND
BORNE LIKE A COLOURED AND EMBOSOMED FIRE
BY SPIRITS CARRIED IN A PEARL-HUED CAVE
ON THROUGH THE ENCHANTED DIMNESS MOVED HER SOUL
DEATH WALKED IN FRONT OF HER AND SATYAVAN
IN THE DARK FRONT OF DEATH A FAILING STAR
ABOVE WAS THE UNSEEN BALANCE OF HIS FATE
641
THERE CAME A SLOPE THAT SLOWLY DOWNWARD SANK
IT SLIPPED TOWARDS A STUMBLING GREY DESCENT
THE DIM-HEART MARVEL OF THE IDEAL WAS LOST
ITS CROWDING WONDER OF BRIGHT DELICATE DREAMS
AND VAGUE HALF-LIMNED SUBLIMITIES SHE HAD LEFT
THOUGHT FELL TOWARDS LOWER LEVELS HARD AND TENSE
IT PASSIONED FOR SOME CRUDE REALITY
THE TWILIGHT FLOATED STILL BUT CHANGED ITS HUES
AND HEAVILY SWATHED A LESS DELIGHTFUL DREAM
IT SETTLED IN TIRED MASSES ON THE AIR
ITS SYMBOL COLOURS TUNED WITH DULLER REDS
AND ALMOST SEEMED A LURID MIST OF DAY
A STRAINING TAUT AND DIRE BESIEGED HER HEART
HEAVY HER SENSE GREW WITH A DANGEROUS LOAD
AND SADDER GREATER SOUNDS WERE IN HER EARS
AND THROUGH STERN BREAKINGS OF THE LAMBENT GLARE
HER VISION CAUGHT A HURRY OF DRIVING PLAINS
AND CLOUDY MOUNTAINS AND WIDE TAWNY STREAMS
AND CITIES CLIMBED IN MINARETS AND TOWERS
TOWARDS AN UNAVAILING CHANGELESS SKY
LONG QUAYS AND GHAUTS AND HARBOURS WHITE WITH SAILS
CHALLENGED HER SIGHT AWHILE AND THEN WERE GONE
AMIDST THEM TRAVAILED TOILING MULTITUDES
IN EVER SHIFTING PERISHABLE GROUPS
A FOILED CINEMA OF LIT SHADOWY SHAPES
ENVELOPED IN THE GREY MANTLE OF A DREAM
IMAGINING MEANINGS IN LIFE'S HEAVY DRIFT
THEY TRUSTED IN THE UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT
AND WAITED FOR DEATH TO CHANGE THEIR SPIRIT'S SCENE
A SAVAGE DIN OF LABOUR AND A TRAMP
OF ARMOURED LIFE AND THE MONOTONOUS HUM
642
OF THOUGHTS AND ACTS THAT EVER WERE THE SAME
AS IF THE DULL REITERATED DRONE
OF A GREAT BRUTE MACHINE BESET HER SOUL
A GREY DISSATISFIED RUMOUR LIKE A GHOST
OF THE MOANING OF A LOUD UNQUIET SEA
A HUGE INHUMAN CYCLOPEAN VOICE
A BABEL-BUILDERS' SONG TOWERING TO HEAVEN
A THROB OF ENGINES AND THE CLANG OF TOOLS
BROUGHT THE DEEP UNDERTONE OF LABOUR'S PAIN
AS WHEN PALE LIGHTNINGS TEAR A TORTURED SKY
HIGH OVERHEAD A CLOUD-RIMMED SERIES FLARED
CHASING LIKE SMOKE FROM A RED FUNNEL DRIVEN
THE FORCED CREATIONS OF AN IGNORANT MIND
DRIFTING SHE SAW LIKE PICTURED FRAGMENTS FLEE
PHANTOMS OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND BAFFLED HOPES
THE SHAPES OF NATURE AND THE ARTS OF MAN
PHILOSOPHIES AND DISCIPLINES AND LAWS
AND THE DEAD SPIRIT OF OLD SOCIETIES
CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE TITAN AND THE WORM
AS IF LOST REMNANTS OF FORGOTTEN LIGHT
BEFORE HER MIND THERE FLED WITH TRAILING WINGS
DIMMED REVELATIONS AND DELIVERING WORDS
EMPTIED OF THEIR MISSION AND THEIR STRENGTH TO SAVE
THE MESSAGES OF THE EVANGELIST GODS
VOICES OF PROPHETS SCRIPTS OF VANISHING CREEDS
EACH IN ITS HOUR ETERNAL CLAIMED WENT BY
IDEALS SYSTEMS SCIENCES POEMS CRAFTS
TIRELESS THERE PERISHED AND AGAIN RECURRED
SOUGHT RESTLESSLY BY SOME CREATIVE POWER
BUT ALL WERE DREAMS CROSSING AN EMPTY VAST
ASCETIC VOICES CALLED OF LONELY SEERS
ON MOUNTAIN SUMMITS OR BY RIVER BANKS
OR FROM THE DESOLATE HEART OF FOREST GLADES
SEEKING HEAVEN'S REST OR THE SPIRIT'S WORLDLESS PEACE
OR IN BODIES MOTIONLESS LIKE STATUES FIXED
IN TRANCED CESSATIONS OF THEIR SLEEPLESS THOUGHT
643
SAT SLEEPING SOULS AND THIS TOO WAS A DREAM
ALL THINGS THE PAST HAS MADE AND SLAIN WERE THERE
ITS LOST FORGOTTEN FORMS THAT ONCE HAD LIVED
AND ALL THE PRESENT LOVES AS NEW-REVEALED
AND ALL THE HOPES THE FUTURE BRINGS HAD FAILED
ALREADY CAUGHT AND SPENT IN EFFORTS VAIN
REPEATED FRUITLESSLY AGE AFTER AGE
UNWEARIED ALL RETURNED INSISTING STILL
BECAUSE OF JOY IN THE ANGUISH OF PURSUIT
AND JOY TO LABOUR AND TO WIN AND LOSE
AND JOY TO CREATE AND KEEP AND JOY TO KILL
THE ROLLING CYCLES PASSED AND CAME AGAIN
BROUGHT THE SAME TOILS AND THE SAME BARREN END
FORMS EVER NEW AND EVER OLD THE LONG
APPALLING REVOLUTIONS OF THE WORLD
ONCE MORE AROSE THE GREAT DESTROYING VOICE
ACROSS THE FRUITLESS LABOUR OF THE WORLDS
HIS HUGE DENIAL'S ALL-DEFEATING MIGHT
PURSUED THE IGNORANT MARCH OF DOLOROUS TIME
BEHOLD THE FIGURES OF THIS SYMBOL REALM
ITS SOLID OUTLINES OF CREATIVE DREAM
INSPIRING THE GREAT CONCRETE TASKS OF EARTH
IN ITS MOTION-PARABLE OF HUMAN LIFE
HERE THOU CANST TRACE THE OUTCOME NATURE GIVES
TO THE SIN OF BEING AND THE ERROR IN THINGS
AND THE DESIRE THAT COMPELS TO LIVE
AND MAN'S INCURABLE MALADY OF HOPE
IN AN IMMUTABLE ORDER'S HIERARCHY
WHERE NATURE CHANGES NOT MAN CANNOT CHANGE
EVER HE OBEYS HER FIXED MUTATION'S LAW
IN A NEW VERSION OF HER OFT-TOLD TALE
IN EVER-WHEELING CYCLES TURNS THE RACE
HIS MIND IS PENT IN CIRCLING BOUNDARIES
FOR MIND IS MAN BEYOND THOUGHT HE CANNOT SOAR
IF HE COULD LEAVE HIS LIMITS HE WOULD BE SAFE
644
HE SEES BUT CANNOT MOUNT TO HIS GREATER HEAVENS
EVEN WINGED HE SINKS BACK TO HIS NATIVE SOIL
HE IS A CAPTIVE IN HIS NET OF MIND
AND BEATS SOUL-WINGS AGAINST THE WALLS OF LIFE
IN VAIN HIS HEART LIFTS UP ITS YEARNING PRAYER
PEOPLING WITH BRILLIANT GODS THE FORMLESS VOID
THEN DISAPPOINTED TO THE VOID HE TURNS
AND IN ITS HAPPY NOTHINGNESS ASKS RELEASE
THE CALM NIRVANA OF HIS DREAM OF SELF
THE WORD IN SILENCE ENDS IN NOUGHT THE NAME
APART AMID THE MORTAL MULTITUDES
HE CALLS THE GODHEAD INCOMMUNICABLE
TO BE THE LOVER OF HIS LONELY SOUL
OR CASTS HIS SPIRIT INTO ITS VOID EMBRACE
OR HE FINDS HIS COPY IN THE IMPARTIAL ALL
HE IMPARTS TO THE IMMOBILE HIS OWN WILL
ATTRIBUTES TO THE ETERNAL WRATH AND LOVE
AND TO THE INEFFABLE LENDS A THOUSAND NAMES
HOPE NOT TO CALL GOD DOWN INTO HIS LIFE
HOW SHALT THOU BRING THE EVERLASTING HERE
THERE IS NO HOUSE FOR HIM IN HURRYING TIME
VAINLY THOU SEEKST IN MATTER'S WORLD AN AIM
NO AIM IS THERE ONLY A WILL TO BE
ALL WALK BY NATURE BOUND FOR EVER THE SAME
LOOK ON THESE FORMS THAT STAY AWHILE AND PASS
THESE LIVES THAT LONG AND STRIVE THEN ARE NO MORE
THESE STRUCTURES THAT HAVE NO ABIDING TRUTH
THE SAVIOUR CREEDS THAT CANNOT SAVE THEMSELVES
BUT PERISH IN THE STRANGLING HANDS OF THE YEARS
DISCARDED FROM MAN'S THOUGHT PROVED FALSE BY TIME
PHILOSOPHIES THAT STRIP ALL PROBLEMS BARE
BUT NOTHING EVER HAVE SOLVED SINCE EARTH BEGAN
AND SCIENCES OMNIPOTENT IN VAIN
BY WHICH MEN LEARN OF WHAT THE SUNS ARE MADE
TRANSFORM ALL FORMS TO SERVE THEIR OUTWARD NEEDS
RIDE THROUGH THE SKY AND SAIL BENEATH THE SEA
645
BUT LEARN NOT WHAT THEY ARE OR WHY THEY CAME
THESE POLITIES ARCHITECTURES OF MAN'S BRAIN
THAT BRICKED WITH EVIL AND GOOD WALL IN MAN'S SPIRIT
AND FISSURED HOUSES PALACE AT ONCE AND JAIL
ROT WHILE THEY REIGN AND CRUMBLE BEFORE THEY CRASH
THESE REVOLUTIONS DEMON OR DRUNKEN GOD
CONVULSING THE WOUNDED BODY OF MANKIND
ONLY TO PAINT IN NEW COLOURS AN OLD FACE
THESE WARS CARNAGE TRIUMPHANT RUIN GONE MAD
THE WORK OF CENTURIES VANISHING IN AN HOUR
THE BLOOD OF THE VANQUISHED AND THE VICTOR'S CROWN
WHICH MEN TO BE BORN MUST PAY FOR WITH THEIR PAIN
THE HERO'S FACE DIVINE ON SATYR'S LIMBS
THE DEMON'S GRANDEUR MIXED WITH THE DEMIGOD'S
THE GLORY AND THE BEASTHOOD AND THE SHAME
WHY IS IT ALL THE LABOUR AND THE DIN
THE TRANSIENT JOYS THE TIMELESS SEA OF TEARS
THE LONGING AND THE HOPING AND THE CRY
THE BATTLE AND THE VICTORY AND THE FALL
THE AIMLESS JOURNEY THAT CAN NEVER PAUSE
THE WAKING TOIL THE INCOHERENT SLEEP
SONG SHOUTS AND WEEPING WISDOM AND IDLE WORDS
THE LAUGHTER OF MEN THE IRONY OF THE GODS
WHERE LEADS THE MARCH WHITHER THE PILGRIMAGE
WHO KEEPS THE MAP OF THE ROUTE OR PLANNED EACH STAGE
OR ELSE SELF-MOVED THE WORLD WALKS ITS OWN WAY
OR NOTHING IS THERE BUT ONLY A MIND THAT DREAMS
THE WORLD IS A MYTH THAT HAPPENED TO COME TRUE
A LEGEND TOLD TO ITSELF BY CONSCIOUS MIND
IMAGED AND PLAYED ON A FEIGNED MATTER'S GROUND
ON WHICH IT STANDS IN AN UNSUBSTANTIAL VAST
MIND IS THE AUTHOR SPECTATOR ACTOR STAGE
MIND ONLY IS AND WHAT IT THINKS IS SEEN
IF MIND IS ALL RENOUNCE THE HOPE OF BLISS
IF MIND IS ALL RENOUNCE THE HOPE OF TRUTH
FOR MIND CAN NEVER TOUCH THE BODY OF TRUTH
646
AND MIND CAN NEVER SEE THE SOUL OF GOD
ONLY HIS SHADOW IT GRASPS NOR HEARS HIS LAUGH
AS IT TURNS FROM HIM TO THE VAIN SEEMING OF THINGS
MIND IS A TISSUE WOVEN OF LIGHT AND SHADE
WHERE RIGHT AND WRONG HAVE SEWN THEIR MINGLED PARTS
OR MIND IS NATURE'S MARRIAGE OF CONVENANCE
BETWEEN TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD BETWEEN JOY AND PAIN
THIS STRUGGLING PAIR NO COURT CAN SEPARATE
EACH THOUGHT IS A GOLD COIN WITH BRIGHT ALLOY
AND ERROR AND TRUTH ARE ITS OBVERSE AND REVERSE
THIS IS THE IMPERIAL MINTAGE OF THE BRAIN
AND OF THIS KIND IS ALL ITS CURRENCY
THINK NOT TO PLANT ON EARTH THE LIVING TRUTH
OR MAKE OF MATTER'S WORLD THE HOME OF GOD
TRUTH COMES NOT THERE BUT ONLY THE THOUGHT OF TRUTH
GOD IS NOT THERE BUT ONLY THE NAME OF GOD
IF SELF THERE IS IT IS BODILESS AND UNBORN
IT IS NO ONE AND IT IS POSSESSED BY NONE
ON WHAT SHALT THOU THEN BUILD THY HAPPY WORLD
CAST OFF THY LIFE AND MIND THEN ART THOU SELF
AN ALL-SEEING OMNIPRESENCE STARK ALONE
IF GOD THERE IS HE CARES NOT FOR THE WORLD
ALL THINGS HE SEES WITH CALM INDIFFERENT GAZE
HE HAS DOOMED ALL HEARTS TO SORROW AND DESIRE
HE HAS BOUND ALL LIFE WITH HIS IMPLACABLE LAWS
HE ANSWERS NOT THE IGNORANT VOICE OF PRAYER
ETERNAL WHILE THE AGES TOIL BENEATH
UNMOVED UNTOUCHED BY AUGHT THAT HE HAS MADE
HE SEES AS MINUTE DETAILS MID THE STARS
THE ANIMAL'S AGONY AND THE FATE OF MAN
IMMEASURABLY WISE HE EXCEEDS THY THOUGHT
HIS SOLITARY JOY NEEDS NOT THY LOVE
HIS TRUTH IN HUMAN THINKING CANNOT DWELL
IF THOU DESIREST TRUTH THEN STILL THY MIND
FOR EVER SLAIN BY THE DUMB UNSEEN LIGHT
IMMORTAL BLISS LIVES NOT IN HUMAN AIR
647
HOW SHALL THE MIGHTY MOTHER HER CALM DELIGHT
KEEP FRAGRANT IN THIS NARROW FRAGILE VASE
OR LODGE HER SWEET UNBROKEN ECSTASY
IN HEARTS WHICH EARTHLY SORROW CAN ASSAIL
AND BODIES CARELESS DEATH CAN SLAY AT WILL
DREAM NOT TO CHANGE THE WORLD THAT GOD HAS PLANNED
STRIVE NOT TO ALTER HIS ETERNAL LAW
IF HEAVENS THERE ARE WHOSE GATES ARE SHUT TO GRIEF
THERE SEEK THE JOY THOU COULDST NOT FIND ON EARTH
OR IN THE IMPERISHABLE HEMISPHERE
WHERE LIGHT IS NATIVE AND DELIGHT IS KING
AND SPIRIT IS THE DEATHLESS GROUND OF THINGS
CHOOSE THY HIGH STATION CHILD OF ETERNITY
IF THOU ART SPIRIT AND NATURE IS THY ROBE
CAST OFF THY GARB AND BE THY NAKED SELF
IMMUTABLE IN ITS UNDYING TRUTH
ALONE FOR EVER IN THE MUTE ALONE
TURN THEN TO GOD FOR HIM LEAVE ALL BEHIND
FORGETTING LOVE FORGETTING SATYAVAN
ANNUL THYSELF IN HIS IMMOBILE PEACE
O SOUL DROWN IN HIS STILL BEATITUDE
FOR THOU MUST DIE TO THYSELF TO REACH GOD'S HEIGHT
I DEATH AM THE GATE OF IMMORTALITY
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED TO THE SOPHIST GOD
ONCE MORE WILT THOU CALL LIGHT TO BLIND TRUTH'S EYES
MAKE KNOWLEDGE A CATCH OF THE SNARE OF IGNORANCE
AND THE WORD A DART TO SLAY MY LIVING SOUL
OFFER O KING THY BOONS TO TIRED SPIRITS
AND HEARTS THAT COULD NOT BEAR THE WOUNDS OF TIME
LET THOSE WHO WERE TIED TO BODY AND TO MIND
TEAR OFF THOSE BONDS AND FLEE INTO WHITE CALM
CRYING FOR A REFUGE FROM THE PLAY OF GOD
SURELY THY BOONS ARE GREAT SINCE THOU ART HE
BUT HOW SHALL I SEEK REST IN ENDLESS PEACE
WHO HOUSE THE MIGHTY MOTHER'S VIOLENT FORCE
HER VISION TURNED TO READ THE ENIGMAED WORLD
648
HER WILL TEMPERED IN THE BLAZE OF WISDOM'S SUN
AND THE FLAMING SILENCE OF HER HEART OF LOVE
THE WORLD IS A SPIRITUAL PARADOX
INVENTED BY A NEED IN THE UNSEEN
A POOR TRANSLATION TO THE CREATURE'S SENSE
OF THAT WHICH FOR EVER EXCEEDS IDEA AND SPEECH
A SYMBOL OF WHAT CAN NEVER BE SYMBOLISED
A LANGUAGE MISPRONOUNCED MISSPELT YET TRUE
ITS POWERS HAVE COME FROM THE ETERNAL HEIGHTS
AND PLUNGED INTO THE INCONSCIENT DIM ABYSS
AND RISEN FROM IT TO DO THEIR MARVELLOUS WORK
THE SOUL IS A FIGURE OF THE UNMANIFEST
THE MIND LABOURS TO THINK THE UNTHINKABLE
THE LIFE TO CALL THE IMMORTAL INTO BIRTH
THE BODY TO ENSHRINE THE ILLIMITABLE
THE WORLD IS NOT CUT OFF FROM TRUTH AND GOD
IN VAIN THOU HAST DUG THE DARK UNBRIDGEABLE GULF
IN VAIN THOU HAST BUILT THE BLIND AND DOORLESS WALL
MAN'S SOUL CROSSES THROUGH THEE TO PARADISE
HEAVEN'S SUN FORCES ITS WAY THROUGH DEATH AND NIGHT
ITS LIGHT IS SEEN UPON OUR BEING'S VERGE
MY MIND IS A TORCH LIT FROM THE ETERNAL SUN
MY LIFE A BREATH DRAWN BY THE IMMORTAL GUEST
MY MORTAL BODY IS THE ETERNAL'S HOUSE
ALREADY THE TORCH BECOMES THE UNDYING RAY
ALREADY THE LIFE IS THE IMMORTAL'S FORCE
THE HOUSE GROWS OF THE HOUSEHOLDER PART AND ONE
HOW SAYST THOU TRUTH CAN NEVER LIGHT THE HUMAN MIND
AND BLISS CAN NEVER INVADE THE MORTAL'S HEART
OR GOD DESCEND INTO THE WORLD HE MADE
IF IN THE MEANINGLESS VOID CREATION ROSE
IF FROM A BODILESS FORCE MATTER WAS BORN
IF LIFE COULD CLIMB IN THE UNCONSCIOUS TREE
ITS GREEN DELIGHT BREAK INTO EMERALD LEAVES
AND ITS LAUGHTER OF BEAUTY BLOSSOM IN THE FLOWER
IF SENSE COULD WAKE IN TISSUE NERVE AND CELL
649
AND THOUGHT SEIZE THE GREY MATTER OF THE BRAIN
AND SOUL PEEP FROM ITS SECRECY THROUGH THE FLESH
HOW SHALL THE NAMELESS LIGHT NOT LEAP ON MEN
AND UNKNOWN POWERS EMERGE FROM NATURE'S SLEEP
EVEN NOW HINTS OF A LUMINOUS TRUTH LIKE STARS
ARISE IN THE MIND-MOONED SPLENDOUR OF IGNORANCE
EVEN NOW THE DEATHLESS LOVER'S TOUCH WE FEEL
IF THE CHAMBER'S DOOR IS EVEN A LITTLE AJAR
WHAT THEN CAN HINDER GOD FROM STEALING IN
OR WHO FORBID HIS KISS ON THE SLEEPING SOUL
ALREADY GOD IS NEAR THE TRUTH IS CLOSE
BECAUSE THE DARK ATHEIST BODY KNOWS HIM NOT
MUST THE SAGE DENY THE LIGHT THE SEER HIS SOUL
I AM NOT BOUND BY THOUGHT OR SENSE OR SHAPE
I LIVE IN THE GLORY OF THE INFINITE
I AM NEAR TO THE NAMELESS AND UNKNOWABLE
THE INEFFABLE IS NOW MY HOUSEHOLD MATE
BUT STANDING ON ETERNITY'S LUMINOUS BRINK
I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE WORLD WAS HE
I HAVE MET SPIRIT WITH SPIRIT SELF WITH SELF
BUT I HAVE LOVED TOO THE BODY OF MY GOD
I HAVE PURSUED HIM IN HIS EARTHLY FORM
A LONELY FREEDOM CANNOT SATISFY
A HEART THAT HAS GROWN ONE WITH EVERY HEART
I AM A DEPUTY OF THE ASPIRING WORLD
MY SPIRIT'S LIBERTY I ASK FOR ALL
THEN RANG AGAIN A DEEPER CRY OF DEATH
AS IF BENEATH ITS WEIGHT OF STERILE LAW
OPPRESSED BY ITS OWN OBSTINATE MEANINGLESS WILL
DISDAINFUL WEARY AND COMPASSIONATE
IT KEPT NO MORE ITS OLD INTOLERANT SOUND
BUT SEEMED LIKE LIFE'S IN HER UNNUMBERED PATHS
TOILING FOR EVER AND ACHIEVING NOUGHT
BECAUSE OF BIRTH AND CHANGE HER MORTAL POWERS
BY WHICH SHE LASTS AROUND THE TERM-POSTS FIXED
650
TURNING OF A WIDE CIRCLING AIMLESS RACE
WHOSE COURSE FOR EVER SPEEDS AND IS THE SAME
IN ITS LONG PLAY WITH FATE AND CHANCE AND TIME
ASSURED OF THE GAME'S VANITY LOST OR WON
CRUSHED BY ITS LOAD OF IGNORANCE AND DOUBT
WHICH KNOWLEDGE SEEMS TO INCREASE AND GROWTH TO ENLARGE
THE EARTH-MIND SINKS AND IT DESPAIRS AND LOOKS
OLD WEARY AND DISCOURAGED ON ITS WORK
YET WAS ALL NOTHING THEN OR VAINLY ACHIEVED
SOME GREAT THING HAS BEEN DONE SOME LIGHT SOME POWER
DELIVERED FROM THE HUGE INCONSCIENT'S GRASP
IT HAS EMERGED FROM NIGHT IT SEES ITS DAWNS
CIRCLING FOR EVER THOUGH NO DAWN CAN STAY
THIS CHANGE WAS IN THE GODHEAD'S FAR-FLUNG VOICE
HIS FORM OF DREAD WAS ALTERED AND ADMITTED
OUR TRANSIENT EFFORT AT ETERNITY
YET FLUNG VAST DOUBTS OF WHAT MIGHT ELSE HAVE BEEN
ON GRANDIOSE HINTS OF AN IMPOSSIBLE DAY
THE GREAT VOICE SURGING CRIED TO SAVITRI
BECAUSE THOU KNOWST THE WISDOM THAT TRANSCENDS
BOTH VEIL OF FORMS AND THE CONTEMPT OF FORMS
ARISE DELIVERED BY THE SEEING GODS
IF FREE THOU HADST KEPT THY MIND FROM LIFE'S FIERCE STRESS
THOU MIGHTST HAVE BEEN LIKE THEM OMNISCIENT CALM
BUT THE VIOLENT AND PASSIONATE HEART FORBIDS
IT IS THE STORM BIRD OF AN ANARCH POWER
THAT WOULD UPHEAVE THE WORLD AND TEAR FROM IT
THE INDECIPHERABLE SCROLL OF FATE
DEATH'S RULE AND LAW AND THE UNKNOWABLE WILL
HASTENERS TO ACTION VIOLATORS OF GOD
ARE THESE GREAT SPIRITS WHO HAVE TOO MUCH LOVE
AND THEY WHO FORMED LIKE THEE FOR BOTH ART THOU
HAVE COME INTO THE NARROW BOUNDS OF LIFE
WITH TOO LARGE NATURES OVERLEAPING TIME
WORSHIPPERS OF FORCE WHO KNOW NOT HER RECOIL
THEIR GIANT WILLS COMPEL THE TROUBLED YEARS
651
THE WISE ARE TRANQUIL SILENT THE GREAT HILLS
RISE CEASELESSLY TOWARDS THEIR UNREACHED SKY
SEATED ON THEIR UNCHANGING BASE THEIR HEADS
DREAMLESS IN HEAVEN'S IMMUTABLE DOMAIN
ON THEIR ASPIRING TOPS SUBLIME AND STILL
LIFTING HALF-WAY TO HEAVEN THE CLIMBING SOUL
THE MIGHTY MEDIATORS STAND CONTENT
TO WATCH THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE STARS
MOTIONLESSLY MOVING WITH THE MIGHT OF EARTH
THEY SEE THE AGES PASS AND ARE THE SAME
THE WISE THINK WITH THE CYCLES THEY HEAR THE TREAD
OF FAR-OFF THINGS PATIENT UNMOVED THEY KEEP
THEIR DANGEROUS WISDOM IN THEIR DEPTHS RESTRAINED
LEST MAN'S FRAIL DAYS INTO THE UNKNOWN SHOULD SINK
DRAGGED LIKE A SHIP BY BOUND LEVIATHAN
INTO THE ABYSS OF HIS STUPENDOUS SEAS
LO HOW ALL SHAKES WHEN THE GODS TREAD TOO NEAR
ALL MOVES IS IN PERIL ANGUISHED TORN UPHEAVED
THE HURRYING AEONS WOULD STUMBLE ON TOO SWIFT
IF STRENGTH FROM HEAVEN SURPRISED THE IMPERFECT EARTH
AND VEILLESS KNOWLEDGE SMOTE THESE UNFIT SOULS
THE DEITIES HAVE SCREENED THEIR DREADFUL POWER
GOD HIDES HIS THOUGHT AND EVEN HE SEEMS TO ERR
BE STILL AND TARDY IN THE SLOW WISE WORLD
MIGHTY ART THOU WITH THE DREAD GODDESS FILLED
TO WHOM THOU CRIEDST AT DAWN IN THE DIM WOODS
USE NOT THY STRENGTH LIKE THE WILD TITAN SOULS
TOUCH NOT THE SEATED LINES THE ANCIENT LAWS
RESPECT THE CALM OF GREAT ESTABLISHED THINGS
BUT SAVITRI REPLIED TO THE HUGE GOD
WHAT IS THE CALM THOU VAUNTST O LAW O DEATH
IS IT NOT THE DULL-VISIONED TREAD INERT
OF MONSTROUS ENERGIES CHAINED IN A STARK ROUND
SOULLESS AND STONE-EYED WITH MECHANIC DREAMS
VAIN THE SOUL'S HOPE IF CHANGELESS LAW IS ALL
EVER TO THE NEW AND THE UNKNOWN PRESS ON
652
THE SPEEDING AEONS JUSTIFYING GOD
WHAT WERE EARTH'S AGES IF THE GREY RESTRAINT
WERE NEVER BROKEN AND GLORIES SPRANG NOT FORTH
BURSTING THEIR OBSCURE SEED WHILE MAN'S SLOW LIFE
LEAPED HURRIED INTO SUDDEN SPLENDID PATHS
BY DIVINE WORDS AND HUMAN GODS REVEALED
IMPOSE NOT UPON SENTIENT MINDS AND HEARTS
THE DULL FIXITY THAT BINDS INANIMATE THINGS
WELL IS THE UNCONSCIOUS RULE FOR THE ANIMAL BREEDS
CONTENT TO LIVE BENEATH THE IMMUTABLE YOKE
MAN TURNS TO A NOBLER WALK A MASTER PATH
I TRAMPLE ON THY LAW WITH LIVING FEET
FOR TO ARISE IN FREEDOM I WAS BORN
IF I AM MIGHTY LET MY FORCE BE UNVEILED
EQUAL COMPANION OF THE DATELESS POWERS
OR ELSE LET MY FRUSTRATED SOUL SINK DOWN
UNWORTHY OF GODHEAD IN THE ORIGINAL SLEEP
I CLAIM FROM TIME MY WILL'S ETERNITY
GOD FROM HIS MOMENTS DEATH REPLIED TO HER
WHY SHOULD THE NOBLE AND IMMORTAL WILL
STOOP TO THE PETTY WORKS OF TRANSIENT EARTH
FREEDOM FORGOTTEN AND THE ETERNAL'S PATH
OR IS THIS THE HIGH USE OF STRENGTH AND THOUGHT
TO STRUGGLE WITH THE BONDS OF DEATH AND TIME
AND SPEND THE LABOUR THAT MIGHT EARN THE GODS
AND BATTLE AND BEAR AGONY OF WOUNDS
TO GRASP THE TRIVIAL JOYS THAT EARTH CAN GUARD
IN HER SMALL TREASURE-CHEST OF PASSING THINGS
CHILD HAST THOU TRODDEN THE GODS BENEATH THY FEET
ONLY TO WIN POOR SHREDS OF EARTHLY LIFE
FOR HIM THOU LOV'ST CANCELLING THE GRAND RELEASE
KEEPING FROM EARLY RAPTURE OF THE HEAVENS
HIS SOUL THE LENIENT DEITIES HAVE CALLED
ARE THY ARMS SWEETER THAN THE COURTS OF GOD
SHE ANSWERED STRAIGHT I TRAMPLE ON THE ROAD
THE STRONG HAND HEWED FOR ME WHICH PLANNED OUR PATHS
653
I RUN WHERE HIS SWEET DREADFUL VOICE COMMANDS
AND I AM DRIVEN BY THE REINS OF GOD
WHY DREW HE WIDE HIS SCHEME OF MIGHTY WORLDS
OR FILLED INFINITY WITH HIS PASSIONATE BREATH
OR WHEREFORE DID HE BUILD MY MORTAL FORM
AND SOW IN ME HIS BRIGHT AND PROUD DESIRES
IF NOT TO ACHIEVE TO FLOWER IN ME TO LOVE
CARVING HIS HUMAN IMAGE RICHLY SHAPED
IN THOUGHTS AND LARGENESSES AND GOLDEN POWERS
FAR HEAVEN CAN WAIT OUR COMING IN ITS CALM
EASY THE HEAVENS WERE TO BUILD FOR GOD
EARTH WAS HIS DIFFICULT MATTER EARTH THE GLORY
GAVE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE RACE AND STRIFE
THERE ARE THE OMINOUS MASKS THE TERRIBLE POWERS
THERE IT IS GREATNESS TO CREATE THE GODS
IS NOT THE SPIRIT IMMORTAL AND ABSOLVED
ALWAYS DELIVERED FROM THE GRASP OF TIME
WHY CAME IT DOWN INTO THE MORTAL'S SPACE
A CHARGE HE GAVE TO HIS HIGH SPIRIT IN MAN
AND WROTE A HIDDEN DECREE ON NATURE'S TOPS
FREEDOM IS THIS WITH EVER SEATED SOUL
LARGE IN LIFE'S LIMITS STRONG IN MATTER'S KNOTS
BUILDING GREAT STUFF OF ACTION FROM THE WORLDS
TO MAKE FINE WISDOM FROM COARSE SCATTERED STRANDS
AND LOVE AND BEAUTY OUT OF WAR AND NIGHT
THE WAGER WONDERFUL THE GAME DIVINE
WHAT LIBERTY HAS THE SOUL WHICH FEELS NOT FREE
UNLESS STRIPPED BARE AND CANNOT KISS THE BONDS
THE LOVER WINDS AROUND HIS PLAYMATE'S LIMBS
CHOOSING HIS TYRANNY CRUSHED IN HIS EMBRACE
TO SEIZE HIM BETTER WITH HER BOUNDLESS HEART
SHE ACCEPTS THE LIMITING CIRCLE OF HIS ARMS
BOWS FULL OF BLISS BENEATH HIS MASTERING HANDS
AND LAUGHS IN HIS RICH CONSTRAINTS MOST BOUND MOST FREE
THIS IS MY ANSWER TO THY LURES O DEATH
654
IMMUTABLE DEATH'S DENIAL MET HER CRY
HOWEVER MIGHTY WHATEVER THY SECRET NAME
UTTERED IN HIDDEN CONCLAVES OF THE GODS
THY HEART'S EPHEMERAL PASSION CANNOT BREAK
THE IRON RAMPART OF ACCOMPLISHED THINGS
WITH WHICH THE GREAT GODS FENCE THEIR CAMP IN SPACE
WHOEVER THOU ART BEHIND THY HUMAN MASK
EVEN IF THOU ART THE MOTHER OF THE WORLDS
AND PEGST THY CLAIM UPON THE REALMS OF CHANCE
THE COSMIC LAW IS GREATER THAN THY WILL
EVEN GOD HIMSELF OBEYS THE LAWS HE MADE
THE LAW ABIDES AND NEVER CAN IT CHANGE
THE PERSON IS A BUBBLE ON TIME'S SEA
A FORERUNNER OF A GREATER TRUTH TO COME
THY SOUL CREATOR OF ITS FREER LAW
VAUNTING A FORCE BEHIND ON WHICH IT LEANS
A LIGHT ABOVE WHICH NONE BUT THOU HAST SEEN
THOU CLAIMST THE FIRST FRUITS OF TRUTH'S VICTORY
BUT WHAT IS TRUTH AND WHO CAN FIND HER FORM
AMID THE SPECIOUS IMAGES OF SENSE
AMID THE CROWDING GUESSES OF THE MIND
AND THE DARK AMBIGUITIES OF A WORLD
PEOPLED WITH THE INCERTITUDES OF THOUGHT
FOR WHERE IS TRUTH AND WHEN WAS HER FOOTFALL HEARD
AMID THE ENDLESS CLAMOUR OF TIME'S MART
AND WHICH IS HER VOICE AMID THE THOUSAND CRIES
THAT CROSS THE LISTENING BRAIN AND CHEAT THE SOUL
OR IS TRUTH AUGHT BUT A HIGH STARRY NAME
OR A VAGUE AND SPLENDID WORD BY WHICH MAN'S THOUGHT
SANCTIONS AND CONSECRATES HIS NATURE'S CHOICE
THE HEART'S WISH DONNING KNOWLEDGE AS ITS ROBE
THE CHERISHED IDEA ELECT AMONG THE ELECT
THOUGHT'S FAVOURITE MID THE CHILDREN OF HALF-LIGHT
WHO HIGH-VOICED CROWD THE PLAYGROUNDS OF THE MIND
OR PEOPLE ITS DORMITORIES IN INFANT SLEEP
ALL THINGS HANG HERE BETWEEN GOD'S YES AND NO
655
TWO POWERS REAL BUT TO EACH OTHER UNTRUE
TWO CONSORT STARS IN THE MOONED NIGHT OF MIND
THAT TOWARDS TWO OPPOSITE HORIZONS GAZE
THE WHITE HEAD AND BLACK TAIL OF THE MYSTIC DRAKE
THE SWIFT AND THE LAME FOOT WING STRONG WING BROKEN
SUSTAINING THE BODY OF THE UNCERTAIN WORLD
A GREAT SURREAL DRAGON IN THE SKIES
TOO DANGEROUSLY THY HIGH PROUD TRUTH MUST LIVE
ENTANGLED IN MATTER'S MORTAL LITTLENESS
ALL IN THIS WORLD IS TRUE YET ALL IS FALSE
ITS THOUGHTS INTO AN ETERNAL CIPHER RUN
ITS DEEDS SWELL TO TIME'S ROUNDED ZERO SUM
THUS MAN AT ONCE IS ANIMAL AND GOD
A DISPARATE ENIGMA OF GOD'S MAKE
UNABLE TO FREE THE GODHEAD'S FORM WITHIN
A BEING LESS THAN HIMSELF YET SOMETHING MORE
THE ASPIRING ANIMAL THE FRUSTRATE GOD
YET NEITHER BEAST NOR DEITY BUT MAN
BUT MAN TIED TO THE KIND EARTH'S LABOUR STRIVES TO EXCEED
CLIMBING THE STAIRS OF GOD TO HIGHER THINGS
OBJECTS ARE SEEMINGS AND NONE KNOWS THEIR TRUTH
IDEAS ARE GUESSES OF AN IGNORANT GOD
TRUTH HAS NO HOME IN EARTH'S IRRATIONAL BREAST
YET WITHOUT REASON LIFE IS A TANGLE OF DREAMS
BUT REASON IS POISED ABOVE A DIM ABYSS
AND STANDS AT LAST UPON A PLANK OF DOUBT
ETERNAL TRUTH LIVES NOT WITH MORTAL MEN
OR IF SHE DWELLS WITHIN THY MORTAL HEART
SHOW ME THE BODY OF THE LIVING TRUTH
OR DRAW FOR ME THE OUTLINE OF HER FACE
THAT I TOO MAY OBEY AND WORSHIP HER
THEN WILL I GIVE THEE BACK THY SATYAVAN
BUT HERE ARE ONLY FACTS AND STEEL-BOUND LAW
THIS TRUTH I KNOW THAT SATYAVAN IS DEAD
AND EVEN THY SWEETNESS CANNOT LURE HIM BACK
NO MAGIC TRUTH CAN BRING THE DEAD TO LIFE
656
NO POWER OF EARTH CANCEL THE THING ONCE DONE
NO JOY OF THE HEART CAN LAST SURVIVING DEATH
NO BLISS PERSUADE THE PAST TO LIVE AGAIN
BUT LIFE ALONE CAN SOLACE THE MUTE VOID
AND FILL WITH THOUGHT THE EMPTINESS OF TIME
LEAVE THEN THY DEAD O SAVITRI AND LIVE
THE WOMAN ANSWERED TO THE MIGHTY SHADE
AND AS SHE SPOKE MORTALITY DISAPPEARED
HER GODDESS SELF GREW VISIBLE IN HER EYES
LIGHT CAME A DREAM OF HEAVEN INTO HER FACE
O DEATH THOU TOO ART GOD AND YET NOT HE
BUT ONLY HIS OWN BLACK SHADOW ON HIS PATH
AS LEAVING THE NIGHT HE TAKES THE UPWARD WAY
AND DRAGS WITH HIM ITS CLINGING INCONSCIENT FORCE
OF GOD UNCONSCIOUS THOU ART THE DARK HEAD
OF HIS IGNORANCE THOU ART THE IMPENITENT SIGN
OF ITS VAST TENEBROUS WOMB THE NATURAL CHILD
ON HIS IMMORTALITY THE SINISTER BAR
ALL CONTRARIES ARE ASPECTS OF GOD'S FACE
THE MANY ARE THE INNUMERABLE ONE
THE ONE CARRIES THE MULTITUDE IN HIS BREAST
HE IS THE IMPERSONAL INSCRUTABLE SOLE
HE IS THE ONE INFINITE PERSON SEEING HIS WORLD
THE SILENCE BEARS THE ETERNAL'S GREAT DUMB SEAL
HIS LIGHT INSPIRES THE ETERNAL WORD
HE IS THE IMMOBILE'S DEEP AND DEATHLESS HUSH
ITS WHITE AND SIGNLESS BLANK NEGATING CALM
YET STANDS THE CREATOR SELF THE ALMIGHTY LORD
AND WATCHES HIS WILL DONE BY THE FORMS OF GODS
AND THE DESIRE THAT GOADS HALF-CONSCIOUS MAN
AND THE RELUCTANT AND UNSEEING NIGHT
THESE WIDE DIVINE EXTREMES THESE INVERSE POWERS
ARE THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY OF GOD
EXISTENCE BALANCED TWIXT TWO MIGHTY ARMS
CONFRONTS THE MIND WITH UNSOLVED ABYSMS OF THOUGHT
DARKNESS BELOW A FATHOMLESS LIGHT ABOVE
657
IN LIGHT ARE JOINED BUT SUNDERED BY SEVERING MIND
STAND FACE TO FACE OPPOSITE INSEPARABLE
TWO CONTRARIES NEEDED FOR HIS GREAT WORLD-TASK
TWO POLES WHOSE CURRENTS WAKE THE IMMENSE WORLD-FORCE
IN THE STUPENDOUS SECRECY OF HIS SELF
ABOVE THE WORLD BROODING WITH EQUAL WINGS
HE IS BOTH IN ONE BEGINNINGLESS WITHOUT END
TRANSCENDING BOTH HE ENTERS THE ABSOLUTE
HIS BEING IS A MYSTERY BEYOND MIND
HIS WAYS BEWILDER MORTAL IGNORANCE
THE FINITE IN ITS LITTLE SECTIONS PARKED
AMAZED CREDITS NOT GOD'S AUDACITY
WHO DARES TO BE THE UNIMAGINED ALL
AND SEE AND ACT AS MIGHT ONE INFINITE
AGAINST HUMAN REASON THIS IS HIS OFFENCE
BEING KNOWN TO BE FOR EVER UNKNOWABLE
TO BE ALL AND YET TRANSCEND THE MYSTIC WHOLE
ABSOLUTE TO LODGE IN A RELATIVE WORLD OF TIME
ETERNAL AND ALL-KNOWING TO SUFFER BIRTH
OMNIPOTENT TO SPORT WITH CHANCE AND FATE
SPIRIT YET TO BE MATTER AND THE VOID
ILLIMITABLE BEYOND FORM OR NAME
TO DWELL WITHIN A BODY ONE AND SUPREME
TO BE ANIMAL AND HUMAN AND DIVINE
A STILL DEEP SEA HE LAUGHS IN ROLLING WAVES
UNIVERSAL HE IS ALL TRANSCENDENT NONE
TO MAN'S RIGHTEOUSNESS THIS IS HIS COSMIC CRIME
ALMIGHTY BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL TO DWELL
LEAVING THE GOOD TO THEIR FATE IN A WICKED WORLD
AND EVIL TO REIGN IN THIS ENORMOUS SCENE
ALL OPPOSITION SEEMS AND STRIFE AND CHANCE
AN AIMLESS LABOUR WITH BUT SCANTY SENSE
TO EYES THAT SEE A PART AND MISS THE WHOLE
THE SURFACE MEN SCAN THE DEPTHS REFUSE THEIR SEARCH
A HYBRID MYSTERY CHALLENGES THE VIEW
OR A DISCOURAGING SORDID MIRACLE
658
YET IN THE EXACT INCONSCIENT'S STARK CONCEIT
IN THE CASUAL ERROR OF THE WORLD'S IGNORANCE
A PLAN A HIDDEN INTELLIGENCE IS GLIMPSED
THERE IS A PURPOSE IN EACH STUMBLE AND FALL
NATURE'S MOST CARELESS LOLLING IS A POSE
PREPARING SOME FORWARD STEP SOME DEEP RESULT
INGENIOUS NOTES PLUGGED INTO A MOTIVED SCORE
THESE MILLION DISCORDS DOT THE HARMONIOUS THEME
OF THE EVOLUTION'S HUGE ORCHESTRAL DANCE
A TRUTH SUPREME HAS FORCED THE WORLD TO BE
IT HAS WRAPPED ITSELF IN MATTER AS IN A SHROUD
A SHROUD OF DEATH A SHROUD OF IGNORANCE
IT COMPELLED THE SUNS TO BURN THROUGH SILENT SPACE
FLAME-SIGNS OF ITS UNCOMPREHENDED THOUGHT
IN A WIDE BROODING ETHER'S FORMLESS MUSE
IT MADE OF KNOWLEDGE A VEILED AND STRUGGLING LIGHT
OF BEING A SUBSTANCE NESCIENT DENSE AND DUMB
OF BLISS THE BEAUTY OF AN INSENTIENT WORLD
IN FINITE THINGS THE CONSCIOUS INFINITE DWELLS
INVOLVED IT SLEEPS IN MATTER'S HELPLESS TRANCE
IT RULES THE WORLD FROM ITS SLEEPING SENSELESS VOID
DREAMING IT THROWS OUT MIND AND HEART AND SOUL
TO LABOUR CRIPPLED BOUND ON THE HARD EARTH
A BROKEN WHOLE IT WORKS THROUGH SCATTERED POINTS
ITS GLEAMING SHARDS ARE WISDOM'S DIAMOND THOUGHTS
ITS SHADOWY REFLEX OUR IGNORANCE
IT STARTS FROM THE MUTE MASS IN COUNTLESS JETS
IT FASHIONS A BEING OUT OF BRAIN AND NERVE
A SENTIENT CREATURE FROM ITS PLEASURES AND PANGS
A PACK OF FEELINGS OBSCURE A DOT OF SENSE
SURVIVES AWHILE ANSWERING THE SHOCKS OF LIFE
THEN CRUSHED OR ITS FORCE SPENT LEAVES THE DEAD FORM
LEAVES THE HUGE UNIVERSE IN WHICH IT LIVED
AN INSIGNIFICANT UNCONSIDERED GUEST
BUT THE SOUL GROWS CONCEALED WITHIN ITS HOUSE
IT GIVES TO THE BODY ITS STRENGTH AND MAGNIFICENCE
659
IT FOLLOWS AIMS IN AN IGNORANT AIMLESS WORLD
IT LENDS SIGNIFICANCE TO EARTH'S MEANINGLESS LIFE
A DEMIGOD ANIMAL CAME THINKING MAN
HE WALLOWS IN MUD YET HEAVENWARD SOARS IN THOUGHT
HE PLAYS AND PONDERS LAUGHS AND WEEPS AND DREAMS
SATISFIES HIS LITTLE LONGINGS LIKE THE BEAST
HE PORES UPON LIFE'S BOOK WITH STUDENT EYES
OUT OF THIS TANGLE OF INTELLECT AND SENSE
OUT OF THE NARROW SCOPE OF FINITE THOUGHT
AT LAST HE WAKES INTO SPIRITUAL MIND
A HIGH LIBERTY BEGINS AND LUMINOUS ROOM
HE GLIMPSES ETERNITY TOUCHES THE INFINITE
HE MEETS THE GODS IN GREAT AND SUDDEN HOURS
HE FEELS THE UNIVERSE AS HIS LARGER SELF
MAKES SPACE AND TIME HIS OPPORTUNITY
TO JOIN THE HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS OF BEING IN LIGHT
IN THE HEART'S CAVE SPEAKS SECRETLY WITH GOD
BUT THESE ARE TOUCHES AND HIGH MOMENTS LIVED
FRAGMENTS OF TRUTH SUPREME HAVE LIT HIS SOUL
REFLECTIONS OF THE SUN IN WATERS STILL
A FEW HAVE DARED THE LAST SUPREME ASCENT
AND BREAK THROUGH BORDERS OF BLINDING LIGHT ABOVE
AND FEEL A BREATH AROUND OF MIGHTIER AIR
RECEIVE A VASTER BEING'S MESSAGES
AND BATHE IN ITS IMMENSE INTUITIVE RAY
ON SUMMIT MIND ARE RADIANT ALTITUDES
EXPOSED TO THE LUSTRE OF INFINITY
OUTSKIRTS AND DEPENDENCIES OF THE HOUSE OF TRUTH
UPRAISED ESTATES OF MIND AND MEASURELESS
THERE MAN CAN VISIT BUT THERE HE CANNOT LIVE
A COSMIC THOUGHT SPREADS OUT ITS VASTITUDES
ITS SMALLEST PARTS ARE HERE PHILOSOPHIES
CHALLENGING WITH THEIR DETAILED IMMENSITY
EACH FIGURING AN OMNISCIENT SCHEME OF THINGS
BUT HIGHER STILL CAN CLIMB THE ASCENDING LIGHT
THERE ARE VASTS OF VISION AND ETERNAL SUNS
660
OCEANS OF AN IMMORTAL LUMINOUSNESS
FLAME-HILLS ASSAULTING HEAVEN WITH THEIR PEAKS
THERE DWELLING ALL BECOMES A BLAZE OF SIGHT
A BURNING HEAD OF VISION LEADS THE MIND
THOUGHT TRAILS BEHIND IT ITS LONG COMET TAIL
THE HEART GLOWS AN ILLUMINATE AND SEER
AND SENSE IS KINDLED INTO IDENTITY
A HIGHEST FLIGHT CLIMBS TO A DEEPEST VIEW
IN A WIDE OPENING OF ITS NATIVE SKY
INTUITION'S LIGHTNINGS RANGE IN A BRIGHT PACK
HUNTING ALL HIDDEN TRUTHS OUT OF THEIR LAIRS
ITS FIERY EDGE OF SEEING ABSOLUTE
CLEAVES INTO LOCKED UNKNOWN RETREATS OF SELF
RUMMAGES THE SKY-RECESSES OF THE BRAIN
LIGHTS UP THE OCCULT CHAMBERS OF THE HEART
ITS SPEAR-POINT ICTUS OF DISCOVERY
PRESSED ON THE COVER OF NAME THE SCREEN OF FORM
STRIPS BARE THE SECRET SOUL OF ALL THAT IS
THOUGHT THERE HAS REVELATION'S SUN-BRIGHT EYES
THE WORD A MIGHTY AND INSPIRING VOICE
ENTERS TRUTH'S INMOST CABIN OF PRIVACY
AND TEARS AWAY THE VEIL FROM GOD AND LIFE
THEN STRETCHES THE BOUNDLESS FINITE'S LAST EXPANSE
THE COSMIC EMPIRE OF THE OVERMIND
TIME'S BUFFER STATE BORDERING ETERNITY
TOO VAST FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF MAN'S SOUL
ALL HERE GATHERS BENEATH ONE GOLDEN SKY
THE POWERS THAT BUILD THE COSMOS STATION TAKE
IN ITS HOUSE OF INFINITE POSSIBILITY
EACH GOD FROM THERE BUILDS HIS OWN NATURE'S WORLD
IDEAS ARE PHALANXED LIKE A GROUP OF SUNS
EACH MARSHALLING HIS COMPANY OF RAYS
THOUGHT CROWDS IN MASSES SEIZED BY ONE REGARD
ALL TIME IS ONE BODY SPACE A SINGLE LOOK
THERE IS THE GODHEAD'S UNIVERSAL GAZE
AND THERE THE BOUNDARIES OF IMMORTAL MIND
661
THE LINE THAT PARTS AND JOINS THE HEMISPHERES
CLOSES IN ON THE LABOUR OF THE GODS
FENCING ETERNITY FROM THE TOIL OF TIME
IN HER GLORIOUS KINGDOM OF ETERNAL LIGHT
ALL-RULER RULED BY NONE THE TRUTH SUPREME
OMNIPOTENT OMNISCIENT AND ALONE
IN A GOLDEN COUNTRY KEEPS HER MEASURELESS HOUSE
IN ITS CORRIDOR SHE HEARS THE TREAD THAT COMES
OUT OF THE UNMANIFEST NEVER TO RETURN
TILL THE UNKNOWN IS KNOWN AND SEEN BY MEN
ABOVE THE STRETCH AND BLAZE OF COSMIC SIGHT
ABOVE THE SILENCE OF THE WORDLESS THOUGHT
FORMLESS CREATOR OF IMMORTAL FORMS
NAMELESS INVESTITURED WITH THE NAME DIVINE
TRANSCENDING TIME'S HOURS TRANSCENDING TIMELESSNESS
THE MIGHTY MOTHER SITS IN LUCENT CALM
AND HOLDS THE ETERNAL CHILD UPON HER KNEES
ATTENDING THE DAY WHEN HE SHALL SPEAK TO FATE
THERE IS THE IMAGE OF OUR FUTURE'S HOPE
THERE IS THE SUN FOR WHICH ALL DARKNESS WAITS
THERE IS THE IMPERISHABLE HARMONY
THE WORLD'S CONTRADICTIONS CLIMB TO HER AND ARE ONE
THERE IS THE TRUTH OF WHICH THE WORLD'S TRUTHS ARE SHREDS
THE LIGHT OF WHICH THE WORLD'S IGNORANCE IS THE SHADE
TILL TRUTH DRAWS BACK THE SHADE THAT IT HAS CAST
THE LOVE OUR HEARTS CALL DOWN TO HEAL ALL STRIFE
THE BLISS FOR WHICH THE WORLD'S DERELICT SORROWS YEARN
THENCE COMES THE GLORY SOMETIMES SEEN ON EARTH
THE VISITS OF GODHEAD TO THE HUMAN SOUL
THE BEAUTY AND THE DREAM ON NATURE'S FACE
THERE THE PERFECTION BORN FROM ETERNITY
CALLS TO IT THE PERFECTION BORN IN TIME
THE TRUTH OF GOD SURPRISING HUMAN LIFE
THE IMAGE OF GOD OVERTAKING FINITE SHAPES
THERE IN A WORLD OF EVERLASTING LIGHT
IN THE REALMS OF THE IMMORTAL SUPERMIND
662
TRUTH WHO HIDES HERE HER HEAD IN MYSTERY
HER RIDDLE DEEMED BY REASON IMPOSSIBLE
IN THE STARK STRUCTURE OF MATERIAL FORM
UNENIGMAED LIVES UNMASKED HER FACE AND THERE
IS NATURE AND THE COMMON LAW OF THINGS
THERE IN A BODY MADE OF SPIRIT STUFF
THE HEARTH-STONE OF THE EVERLIVING FIRE
ACTION TRANSLATES THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SOUL
THOUGHT STEPS INFALLIBLE AND ABSOLUTE
AND LIFE IS A CONTINUAL WORSHIP'S RITE
A SACRIFICE OF RAPTURE TO THE ONE
A COSMIC VISION A SPIRITUAL SENSE
FEELS ALL THE INFINITE LODGED IN FINITE FORM
AND SEEN THROUGH A QUIVERING ECSTASY OF LIGHT
DISCOVERS THE BRIGHT FACE OF THE BODILESS
IN THE TRUTH OF A MOMENT IN THE MOMENT'S SOUL
CAN SIP THE HONEY-WINE OF ETERNITY
A SPIRIT WHO IS NO ONE AND INNUMERABLE
THE ONE MYSTIC INFINITE PERSON OF HIS WORLD
MULTIPLIES HIS MYRIAD PERSONALITY
ON ALL HIS BODIES SEALS HIS DIVINITY'S STAMP
AND SITS IN EACH IMMORTAL AND UNIQUE
THE IMMOBILE STANDS BEHIND EACH DAILY ACT
A BACKGROUND OF THE MOVEMENT AND THE SCENE
UPHOLDING CREATION ON ITS MIGHT AND CALM
AND CHANGE ON THE IMMUTABLE'S DEATHLESS POISE
THE TIMELESS LOOKS OUT FROM THE TRAVELLING HOURS
THE INEFFABLE PUTS ON A ROBE OF SPEECH
WHERE ALL ITS WORDS ARE WOVEN LIKE MAGIC THREADS
MOVING WITH BEAUTY INSPIRING WITH THEIR GLEAM
AND EVERY THOUGHT TAKES UP ITS DESTINED PLACE
RECORDED IN THE MEMORY OF THE WORLD
THE TRUTH SUPREME VAST AND IMPERSONAL
FITS FAULTLESSLY THE HOUR AND CIRCUMSTANCE
ITS SUBSTANCE A PURE GOLD EVER THE SAME
BUT SHAPED INTO VESSELS FOR THE SPIRIT'S USE
663
ITS GOLD BECOMES THE WINE JAR AND THE VASE
ALL THERE IS A SUPREME EPIPHANY
THE ALL-WONDERFUL MAKES A MARVEL OF EACH EVENT
THE ALL-BEAUTIFUL IS A MIRACLE IN EACH SHAPE
THE ALL-BLISSFUL SMITES WITH RAPTURE THE HEART'S THROBS
A PURE CELESTIAL JOY IS THE USE OF SENSE
EACH BEING THERE IS A MEMBER OF THE SELF
A PORTION OF THE MILLION-THOUGHTED ALL
A CLAIMANT TO THE TIMELESS UNITY
THE MANY'S SWEETNESS THE JOY OF DIFFERENCE
EDGED WITH THE INTIMACY OF THE ONE
BUT WHO CAN SHOW TO THEE TRUTH'S GLORIOUS FACE
OUR HUMAN WORDS CAN ONLY SHADOW HER
TO THOUGHT SHE IS AN UNTHINKABLE RAPTURE OF LIGHT
TO SPEECH A MARVEL INEXPRESSIBLE
O DEATH IF THOU COULDST TOUCH THE TRUTH SUPREME
THOU WOULDST GROW SUDDENLY WISE AND CEASE TO BE
IF OUR SOULS COULD SEE AND LOVE AND CLASP GOD'S TRUTH
ITS INFINITE RADIANCE WOULD SEIZE OUR HEARTS
OUR BEING IN GOD'S IMAGE BE REMADE
AND EARTHLY LIFE BECOME THE LIFE DIVINE
THEN DEATH THE LAST TIME ANSWERED SAVITRI
IF TRUTH SUPREME TRANSCENDS HER SHADOW HERE
SEVERED BY KNOWLEDGE AND THE CLIMBING VASTS
WHAT BRIDGE CAN CROSS THE GULF THAT SHE HAS LEFT
BETWEEN HER AND THE DREAM-WORLD SHE HAS MADE
OR WHO COULD HOPE TO BRING HER DOWN TO MEN
AND PERSUADE TO TREAD THE HARSH GLOBE WITH WOUNDED FEET
LEAVING HER UNAPPROACHABLE GLORY AND BLISS
WASTING HER SPLENDOUR ON PALE EARTHLY AIR
IS THINE THAT STRENGTH O BEAUTY OF MORTAL LIMBS
O SOUL WHO FLUTTEREST TO ESCAPE MY NET
WHO THEN ART THOU HIDING IN HUMAN GUISE
THY VOICE CARRIES THE SOUND OF INFINITY
KNOWLEDGE IS WITH THEE TRUTH SPEAKS THROUGH THY WORDS
THE LIGHT OF THINGS BEYOND SHINES IN THY EYES
664
BUT WHERE IS THY STRENGTH TO CONQUER TIME AND DEATH
HAST THOU GOD'S FORCE TO BUILD HEAVEN'S VALUES HERE
FOR TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE ARE AN IDLE GLEAM
IF KNOWLEDGE BRINGS NOT POWER TO CHANGE THE WORLD
IF MIGHT COMES NOT TO GIVE TO TRUTH HER RIGHT
A BLIND FORCE NOT TRUTH HAS MADE THIS IGNORANT WORLD
A BLIND FORCE NOT TRUTH ORDERS THE LIVES OF MEN
BY POWER NOT LIGHT THE GREAT GODS RULE THE WORLD
POWER IS THE ARM OF GOD THE SEAL OF FATE
O HUMAN CLAIMANT TO IMMORTALITY
REVEAL THY POWER LAY BARE THY SPIRIT'S FORCE
THEN WILL I GIVE BACK TO THEE SATYAVAN
OR IF THE MIGHTY MOTHER IS WITH THEE
SHOW ME HER FACE THAT I MAY WORSHIP HER
LET DEATHLESS EYES LOOK INTO THE EYES OF DEATH
AN IMPERISHABLE FORCE TOUCHING BRUTE THINGS
TRANSFORM EARTH'S DEATH INTO IMMORTAL LIFE
THEN CAN THY DEAD RETURN TO THEE AND LIVE
THE PROSTRATE EARTH PERHAPS SHALL LIFT HER GAZE
AND FEEL NEAR HER THE SECRET BODY OF GOD
AND LOVE AND JOY OVERTAKE FLEEING TIME
AND SAVITRI LOOKED ON DEATH AND ANSWERED NOT
ALMOST IT SEEMED AS IF IN HIS SYMBOL SHAPE
THE WORLD'S DARKNESS HAD CONSENTED TO HEAVEN-LIGHT
AND GOD NEEDED NO MORE THE INCONSCIENT'S SCREEN
A MIGHTY TRANSFORMATION CAME ON HER
A HALO OF THE INDWELLING DEITY
THE IMMORTAL'S LUSTRE THAT HAD LIT HER FACE
AND TENTED ITS RADIANCE IN HER BODY'S HOUSE
OVERFLOWING MADE THE AIR A LUMINOUS SEA
IN A FLAMING MOMENT OF APOCALYPSE
THE INCARNATION THRUST ASIDE ITS VEIL
A LITTLE FIGURE IN INFINITY
YET STOOD AND SEEMED THE ETERNAL'S VERY HOUSE
AS IF THE WORLD'S CENTRE WAS HER VERY SOUL
665
AND ALL WIDE SPACE WAS BUT ITS OUTER ROBE
A CURVE OF THE CALM HAUTEUR OF FAR HEAVEN
DESCENDING INTO EARTH'S HUMILITY
HER FOREHEAD'S SPAN VAULTED THE OMNISCIENT'S GAZE
HER EYES WERE TWO STARS THAT WATCHED THE UNIVERSE
THE POWER THAT FROM HER BEING'S SUMMIT REIGNED
THE PRESENCE CHAMBERED IN LOTUS SECRECY
CAME DOWN AND HELD THE CENTRE IN HER BROW
WHERE THE MIND'S LORD IN HIS CONTROL-ROOM SITS
THERE THRONED ON CONCENTRATION'S NATIVE SEAT
HE OPENS THAT THIRD MYSTERIOUS EYE IN MAN
THE UNSEEN'S EYE THAT LOOKS AT THE UNSEEN
WHEN LIGHT WITH A GOLDEN ECSTASY FILLS HIS BRAIN
AND THE ETERNAL'S WISDOM DRIVES HIS CHOICE
AND ETERNAL WILL SEIZES THE MORTAL'S WILL
IT STIRRED IN THE LOTUS OF HER THROAT OF SONG
AND IN HER SPEECH THROBBED THE IMMORTAL WORD
HER LIFE SOUNDED WITH THE STEPS OF THE WORLD-SOUL
MOVING IN HARMONY WITH THE COSMIC THOUGHT
AS GLIDES GOD'S SUN INTO THE MYSTIC CAVE
WHERE HIDES HIS LIGHT FROM THE PURSUING GODS
IT GLIDED INTO THE LOTUS OF HER HEART
AND WOKE IN IT THE FORCE THAT ALTERS FATE
IT POURED INTO HER NAVEL'S LOTUS DEPTH
LODGED IN THE LITTLE LIFE-NATURE'S NARROW HOME
ON THE BODY'S LONGINGS GREW HEAVEN-RAPTURE'S FLOWER
AND MADE DESIRE A PURE CELESTIAL FLAME
BROKE INTO THE CAVE WHERE COILED WORLD-ENERGY SLEEPS
AND SMOTE THE THOUSAND-HOODED SERPENT FORCE
THAT BLAZING TOWERED AND CLASPED THE WORLD-SELF ABOVE
JOINED MATTER'S DUMBNESS TO THE SPIRIT'S HUSH
AND FILLED EARTH'S ACTS WITH THE SPIRIT'S SILENT POWER
THUS CHANGED SHE WAITED FOR THE WORD TO SPEAK
ETERNITY LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF DEATH
AND DARKNESS SAW GOD'S LIVING REALITY
THEN A VOICE WAS HEARD THAT SEEMED THE STILLNESS' SELF
666
OR THE LOW CALM UTTERANCE OF INFINITY
WHEN IT SPEAKS TO THE SILENCE IN THE HEART OF SLEEP
I HAIL THEE ALMIGHTY AND VICTORIOUS DEATH
THOU GRANDIOSE DARKNESS OF THE INFINITE
O VOID THAT MAKEST ROOM FOR ALL TO BE
HUNGER THAT GNAWEST AT THE UNIVERSE
CONSUMING THE COLD REMNANTS OF THE SUNS
AND EATST THE WHOLE WORLD WITH THY JAWS OF FIRE
WASTER OF THE ENERGY THAT HAS MADE THE STARS
INCONSCIENCE CARRIER OF THE SEEDS OF THOUGHT
NESCIENCE IN WHICH ALL-KNOWLEDGE SLEEPS ENTOMBED
AND SLOWLY EMERGES IN ITS HOLLOW BREAST
WEARING THE MIND'S MASK OF BRIGHT IGNORANCE
THOU ART MY SHADOW AND MY INSTRUMENT
I HAVE GIVEN THEE THY AWFUL SHAPE OF DREAD
AND THY SHARP SWORD OF TERROR AND GRIEF AND PAIN
TO FORCE THE SOUL OF MAN TO STRUGGLE FOR LIGHT
ON THE BREVITY OF HIS HALF-CONSCIOUS DAYS
THOU ART HIS SPUR TO GREATNESS IN HIS WORKS
THE WHIP TO HIS YEARNING FOR ETERNAL BLISS
HIS POIGNANT NEED OF IMMORTALITY
LIVE DEATH AWHILE BE STILL MY INSTRUMENT
ONE DAY MAN TOO SHALL KNOW THY FATHOMLESS HEART
OF SILENCE AND THE BROODING PEACE OF NIGHT
AND GRAVE OBEDIENCE TO ETERNAL LAW
AND THE CALM INFLEXIBLE PITY IN THY GAZE
BUT NOW O TIMELESS MIGHTINESS STAND ASIDE
AND LEAVE THE PATH OF MY INCARNATE FORCE
RELIEVE THE RADIANT GOD FROM THY BLACK MASK
RELEASE THE SOUL OF THE WORLD CALLED SATYAVAN
FREED FROM THY CLUTCH OF PAIN AND IGNORANCE
THAT HE MAY STAND MASTER OF LIFE AND FATE
MAN'S REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD
THE MATE OF WISDOM AND THE SPOUSE OF LIGHT
THE ETERNAL BRIDEGROOM OF THE ETERNAL BRIDE
SHE SPOKE DEATH UNCONVINCED RESISTED STILL
667
ALTHOUGH HE KNEW REFUSING STILL TO KNOW
ALTHOUGH HE SAW REFUSING STILL TO SEE
UNSHAKABLE HE STOOD CLAIMING HIS RIGHT
HIS SPIRIT BOWED HIS WILL OBEYED THE LAW
OF ITS OWN NATURE BINDING EVEN ON GODS
THE TWO OPPOSED EACH OTHER FACE TO FACE
HIS BEING LIKE A HUGE FORT OF DARKNESS TOWERED
AROUND IT HER LIGHT GREW AN OCEAN'S SIEGE
AWHILE THE SHADE SURVIVED DEFYING HEAVEN
ASSAILING IN FRONT OPPRESSING FROM ABOVE
A CONCRETE MASS OF CONSCIOUS POWER HE BORE
THE TYRANNY OF HER DIVINE DESIRE
A PRESSURE OF INTOLERABLE FORCE
WEIGHED ON HIS UNBOWED HEAD AND STUBBORN BREAST
LIGHT LIKE A BURNING TONGUE LICKED UP HIS THOUGHTS
LIGHT WAS A LUMINOUS TORTURE IN HIS HEART
LIGHT COURSED A SPLENDID AGONY THROUGH HIS NERVES
HIS DARKNESS MUTTERED PERISHING IN HER BLAZE
HER MASTERING WORD COMMANDED EVERY LIMB
AND LEFT NO ROOM FOR HIS ENORMOUS WILL
THAT SEEMED PUSHED OUT INTO SOME HELPLESS SPACE
AND COULD NO MORE RE-ENTER BUT LEFT HIM VOID
HE CALLED TO NIGHT BUT SHE FELL SHUDDERING BACK
HE CALLED TO HELL BUT SULLENLY IT RETIRED
HE TURNED TO THE INCONSCIENT FOR SUPPORT
FROM WHICH HE WAS BORN HIS VAST SUSTAINING SELF
IT DREW HIM BACK TOWARDS BOUNDLESS VACANCY
AS IF BY HIMSELF TO SWALLOW UP HIMSELF
HE CALLED TO HIS STRENGTH BUT IT REFUSED HIS CALL
HIS BODY WAS EATEN BY LIGHT HIS SPIRIT DEVOURED
AT LAST HE KNEW DEFEAT INEVITABLE
AND LEFT CRUMBLING THE SHAPE THAT HE HAD WORN
ABANDONING HOPE TO MAKE MAN'S SOUL HIS PREY
AND FORCE TO BE MORTAL THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT
AFAR HE FLED SHUNNING HER DREADED TOUCH
AND REFUGE TOOK IN THE RETREATING NIGHT
668
IN THE DREAM TWILIGHT OF THAT SYMBOL WORLD
THE DIRE UNIVERSAL SHADOW DISAPPEARED
VANISHING INTO THE VOID FROM WHICH IT CAME
AS IF DEPRIVED OF ITS ORIGINAL CAUSE
THE TWILIGHT REALM PASSED FADING FROM THEIR SOULS
AND SATYAVAN AND SAVITRI WERE ALONE
BUT NEITHER STIRRED BETWEEN THOSE FIGURES ROSE
A MUTE INVISIBLE AND TRANSLUCENT WALL
IN THE LONG BLANK MOMENT'S PAUSE NOTHING COULD MOVE
ALL WAITED ON THE UNKNOWN INSCRUTABLE WILL
671
A MARVELLOUS SUN LOOKED DOWN FROM ECSTASY'S SKIES
ON WORLDS OF DEATHLESS BLISS PERFECTION'S HOME
MAGICAL UNFOLDINGS OF THE ETERNAL'S SMILE
CAPTURING HIS SECRET HEART-BEATS OF DELIGHT
GOD'S EVERLASTING DAY SURROUNDED HER
DOMAINS APPEARED OF SEMPITERNAL LIGHT
INVADING ALL NATURE WITH THE ABSOLUTE'S JOY
HER BODY QUIVERED WITH ETERNITY'S TOUCH
HER SOUL STOOD CLOSE TO THE FOUNTS OF THE INFINITE
INFINITY'S FINITE FRONTS SHE LIVED IN NEW
FOR EVER TO AN EVERLIVING SIGHT
ETERNITY MULTIPLIED ITS VAST SELF-LOOK
TRANSLATING ITS ENDLESS MIGHTINESS AND JOY
INTO DELIGHT SOULS PLAYING WITH TIME COULD SHARE
IN GRANDEURS EVER NEW-BORN FROM THE UNKNOWN DEPTHS
IN POWERS THAT LEAPED IMMORTAL FROM UNKNOWN HEIGHTS
IN PASSIONATE HEART-BEATS OF AN UNDYING LOVE
IN SCENES OF A SWEETNESS THAT CAN NEVER FADE
IMMORTAL TO THE RAPTUROUS HEART AND EYES
IN SERENE ARCHES OF TRANSLUCENT CALM
FROM WONDER'S DREAM-VASTS CLOUDLESS SKIES SLID DOWN
AN ABYSS OF SAPPHIRE SUNLIGHT VISITED EYES
WHICH SUFFERED WITHOUT PAIN THE ABSOLUTE RAY
AND SAW IMMORTAL CLARITIES OF FORM
TWILIGHT AND MIST WERE EXILES FROM THAT AIR
NIGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUCH RADIANT HEAVENS
FIRM IN THE BOSOM OF IMMENSITY
SPIRITUAL BREADTHS WERE SEEN SUBLIMELY BORN
FROM A STILL BEAUTY OF CREATIVE JOY
EMBODIED THOUGHTS TO SWEET DIMENSIONS HELD
672
TO PLEASE SOME CARELESSNESS OF DIVINE PEACE
ANSWERED THE DEEP DEMAND OF AN INFINITE SENSE
AND ITS NEED OF FORMS TO HOUSE ITS BODILESS THRILL
A MARCH OF UNIVERSAL POWERS IN TIME
THE HARMONIC ORDER OF SELF'S VASTITUDES
IN CYCLIC SYMMETRIES AND METRIC PLANES
HARBOURED A COSMIC RAPTURE'S REVELRY
AN ENDLESS FIGURING OF THE SPIRIT IN THINGS
PLANNED BY THE ARTIST WHO HAS DREAMED THE WORLDS
OF ALL THE BEAUTY AND THE MARVEL HERE
OF ALL TIME'S INTRICATE VARIETY
ETERNITY WAS THE SUBSTANCE AND THE SOURCE
NOT FROM A PLASTIC MIST OF MATTER MADE
THEY OFFERED THE SUGGESTION OF THEIR DEPTHS
AND OPENED THE GREAT SERIES OF THEIR POWERS
ARISEN BENEATH A TRIPLE MYSTIC HEAVEN
THE SEVEN IMMORTAL EARTHS WERE SEEN SUBLIME
HOMES OF THE BLEST RELEASED FROM DEATH AND SLEEP
WHERE GRIEF CAN NEVER COME NOR ANY PANG
ARRIVING FROM SELF-LOST AND SEEKING WORLDS
ALTER HEAVEN-NATURE'S CHANGELESS QUIETUDE
AND MIGHTY POSTURE OF ETERNAL CALM
ITS POSE OF ECSTASY IMMUTABLE
PLAINS LAY THAT SEEMED THE EXPANSE OF GOD'S WIDE SLEEP
THOUGHT'S WINGS CLIMBED UP TOWARDS HEAVEN'S VAST REPOSE
LOST IN BLUE DEEPS OF IMMORTALITY
A CHANGED EARTH-NATURE FELT THE BREATH OF PEACE
AIR SEEMED AN OCEAN OF FELICITY
OR THE COUCH OF THE UNKNOWN SPIRITUAL REST
A VAST QUIESCENCE SWALLOWING UP ALL SOUND
INTO A VOICELESSNESS OF UTTER BLISS
EVEN MATTER BROUGHT A CLOSE SPIRITUAL TOUCH
ALL THRILLED WITH THE IMMANENCE OF ONE DIVINE
THE LOWEST OF THESE EARTHS WAS STILL A HEAVEN
TRANSLATING INTO THE SPLENDOUR OF THINGS DIVINE
THE BEAUTY AND BRIGHTNESS OF TERRESTRIAL SCENES
673
ETERNAL MOUNTAINS RIDGE ON GLEAMING RIDGE
WHOSE LINES WERE GRAVED AS ON A SAPPHIRE PLATE
AND ETCHED THE BORDERS OF HEAVEN'S LUSTROUS NOON
CLIMBED LIKE PILED TEMPLE STAIRS AND FROM THEIR HEADS
OF TOPLESS MEDITATION HEARD BELOW
THE APPROACH OF A BLUE PILGRIM MULTITUDE
AND LISTENED TO A GREAT ARRIVING VOICE
OF THE WIDE TRAVEL HYMN OF TIMELESS SEAS
A CHANTING CROWD FROM MOUNTAIN BOSOMS SLIPPED
PAST BRANCHES FRAGRANT WITH A SIGH OF FLOWERS
HURRYING THROUGH SWEETNESSES WITH REVEL LEAPS
THE MURMUROUS RIVERS OF FELICITY
DIVINELY RIPPLED HONEY-VOICED DESIRES
MINGLING THEIR SISTER EDDIES OF DELIGHT
THEN WIDENING TO A PACE OF CALM-LIPPED MUSE
DOWN MANY-GLIMMERED ESTUARIES OF DREAM
WENT WHISPERING INTO LAKES OF LIQUID PEACE
ON A BRINK HELD OF SENSELESS ECSTASY
AND GUARDING AN ETERNAL POISE OF THOUGHT
SAT SCULPTURED SOULS DREAMING BY RIVERS OF SOUND
IN CHANGELESS ATTITUDES OF MARBLE BLISS
AROUND HER LIVED THE CHILDREN OF GOD'S DAY
IN AN UNSPEAKABLE FELICITY
A HAPPINESS NEVER LOST THE IMMORTAL'S EASE
A GLAD ETERNITY'S BLISSFUL MULTITUDE
AROUND THE DEATHLESS NATIONS MOVED AND SPOKE
SOULS OF A LUMINOUS CELESTIAL JOY
FACES OF STARK BEAUTY LIMBS OF THE MOULDED RAY
IN CITIES CUT LIKE GEMS OF CONSCIOUS STONE
AND WONDERFUL PASTURES AND ON GLEAMING COASTS
BRIGHT FORMS WERE SEEN ETERNITY'S LUMINOUS TRIBES
ABOVE HER RHYTHMING GODHEADS WHIRLED THE SPHERES
RAPT MOBILE FIXITIES HERE BLINDLY SOUGHT
BY THE HUGE ERRING ORBITS OF OUR STARS
ECSTATIC VOICES SMOTE AT HEARING'S CHORDS
EACH MOVEMENT FOUND A MUSIC ALL ITS OWN
674
SONGS THRILLED OF BIRDS UPON UNFADING BOUGHS
THE COLOURS OF WHOSE PLUMAGE HAD BEEN CAUGHT
FROM THE RAINBOW OF IMAGINATION'S WINGS
IMMORTAL FRAGRANCE PACKED THE QUIVERING BREEZE
IN GROVES THAT SEEMED MOVED BOSOMS AND TREMBLING DEPTHS
THE MILLION CHILDREN OF THE UNDYING SPRING
BLOOMED PURE UNNUMBERED STARS OF HUED DELIGHT
NESTLING FOR SHELTER IN THEIR EMERALD SKY
FAERY FLOWER-MASSES LOOKED WITH LAUGHING EYES
A DANCING CHAOS AN IRIDESCENT SEA
ETERNISED TO HEAVEN'S EVER-WAKEFUL SIGHT
THE CROWDING PETAL-GLOW OF MARVEL'S TINTS
WHICH FLOAT ACROSS THE CURTAINED LIDS OF DREAM
IMMORTAL HARMONIES FILLED HER LISTENING EAR
A GREAT SPONTANEOUS UTTERANCE OF THE HEIGHTS
ON TITAN WINGS OF RHYTHMIC GRANDEUR BORNE
POURED FROM SOME DEEP SPIRITUAL HEART OF SOUND
STRAINS TREMBLING WITH THE SECRETS OF THE GODS
A SPIRIT WANDERED HAPPILY IN THE WIND
A SPIRIT BROODED IN THE LEAF AND STONE
THE VOICES OF THOUGHT-CONSCIOUS INSTRUMENTS
ALONG A LIVING VERGE OF SILENCE STRAYED
AND FROM SOME DEEP A WORDLESS TONGUE OF THINGS
UNFATHOMED INEXPRESSIBLE CHANTINGS ROSE
TRANSLATING INTO A VOICE THE UNKNOWN
A CLIMBER ON THE INVISIBLE STAIR OF SOUND
MUSIC NOT WITH THESE FEW AND STRIVING STEPS
ASPIRED THAT WANDER UPON TRANSIENT STRINGS
BUT CHANGED ITS EVER NEW UNCOUNTED NOTES
IN A PASSION OF UNFORESEEING DISCOVERY
AND KEPT ITS OLD UNFORGOTTEN ECSTASIES
A GROWING TREASURE IN THE MYSTIC HEART
A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YEARNED THROUGH EVERY CRY
OF UNEXPLORED ATTRACTION AND DESIRE
IT FOUND AND SEARCHED AGAIN THE UNSATISFIED DEEPS
HUNTING AS IF IN SOME DEEP SECRET HEART
675
TO FIND SOME LOST OR MISSED FELICITY
IN THOSE FAR-LAPSING SYMPHONIES SHE COULD HEAR
BREAKING THROUGH ENCHANTMENTS OF THE RAVISHED SENSE
THE LYRIC VOYAGE OF A DIVINE SOUL
MID SPUME AND LAUGHTER TEMPTING WITH ITS PROW
THE CHARM OF INNOCENT CIRCEAN ISLES
ADVENTURES WITHOUT DANGER BEAUTIFUL
IN LANDS WHERE SIREN WONDER SINGS ITS LURES
FROM RHYTHMIC ROCKS IN EVER-FOAMING SEAS
IN THE HARMONY OF AN ORIGINAL SIGHT
DELIVERED FROM OUR LIMITING RAY OF THOUGHT
AND THE RELUCTANCE OF OUR BLINDED HEARTS
TO EMBRACE THE GODHEAD IN WHATEVER GUISE
SHE SAW ALL NATURE MARVELLOUS WITHOUT FAULT
INVADED BY BEAUTY'S UNIVERSAL REVEL
HER BEING'S FIBRE REACHED OUT VIBRATING
AND CLAIMED DEEP UNION WITH ITS OUTER SELVES
AND ON THE HEART'S CHORDS MADE PURE TO SEIZE ALL TONES
HEAVEN'S SUBTLETIES OF TOUCH UNWEARYING FORCED
MORE VIVID RAPTURES THAN EARTH'S LIFE CAN BEAR
WHAT WOULD BE SUFFERING HERE WAS FIERY BLISS
ALL HERE BUT PASSIONATE HINT AND MYSTIC SHADE
DIVINED BY THE INNER PROPHET WHO PERCEIVES
THE SPIRIT OF DELIGHT IN SENSUOUS THINGS
TURNED TO MORE SWEETNESS THAN CAN NOW BE DREAMED
THE MIGHTY SIGNS OF WHICH EARTH FEARS THE STRESS
TREMBLING BECAUSE SHE CANNOT UNDERSTAND
AND MUST KEEP OBSCURE IN FORMS STRANGE AND SUBLIME
WERE HERE THE FIRST LEXICON OF AN INFINITE MIND
TRANSLATING THE LANGUAGE OF ETERNAL BLISS
HERE RAPTURE WAS A COMMON INCIDENT
THE LOVELINESSES OF WHOSE CAPTURED THRILL
OUR HUMAN PLEASURE IS A FALLEN THREAD
LAY SYMBOL SHAPES A CARELESS ORNAMENT
SEWN ON THE RICH BROCADE OF GODHEAD'S DRESS
THINGS FASHIONED WERE THE IMAGED HOMES WHERE MIND
676
ARRIVED TO FATHOM A DEEP PHYSICAL JOY
THE HEART WAS A TORCH LIT FROM INFINITY
THE LIMBS WERE TREMBLING DENSITIES OF SOUL
THESE WERE THE FIRST DOMAINS THE OUTER COURTS
IMMENSE BUT LEAST IN RANGE AND LEAST IN PRICE
THE SLIGHTEST ECSTASIES OF THE UNDYING GODS
HIGHER HER SWING OF VISION SWEPT AND KNEW
ADMITTED THROUGH LARGE SAPPHIRE OPENING GATES
INTO THE WIDENESS OF A LIGHT BEYOND
THESE WERE BUT SUMPTUOUS DECORATED DOORS
TO WORLDS NOBLER MORE FELICITOUSLY FAIR
ENDLESS ASPIRED THE CLIMBING OF THOSE HEAVENS
REALM UPON REALM RECEIVED HER SOARING VIEW
THEN ON WHAT SEEMED ONE CROWN OF THE ASCENT
WHERE FINITE AND THE INFINITE ARE ONE
IMMUNE SHE BEHELD THE STRONG IMMORTALS' SEATS
WHO LIVE FOR A CELESTIAL JOY AND RULE
THE MIDDLE REGIONS OF THE UNFADING RAY
GREAT FORMS OF DEITIES SAT IN DEATHLESS TIERS
EYES OF AN UNBORN GAZE TOWARDS HER LEANED
THROUGH A TRANSPARENCY OF CRYSTAL FIRE
IN THE BEAUTY OF BODIES WROUGHT FROM RAPTURE'S LINES
SHAPES OF ENTRANCING SWEETNESS SPILLING BLISS
FEET GLIMMERING UPON THE SUNSTONE COURTS OF MIND
HEAVEN'S CUPBEARERS BORE ROUND THE ETERNAL'S WINE
A TANGLE OF BRIGHT BODIES OF MOVED SOULS
TRACING THE CLOSE AND INTERTWINED DELIGHT
THE HARMONIOUS TREAD OF LIVES FOR EVER JOINED
IN THE PASSIONATE ONENESS OF A MYSTIC JOY
AS IF SUNBEAMS MADE LIVING AND DIVINE
THE GOLDEN-BOSOMED APSARA GODDESSES
IN GROVES FLOODED FROM AN ARGENT DISK OF BLISS
THAT FLOATED THROUGH A LUMINOUS SAPPHIRE DREAM
IN A CLOUD OF RAIMENT LIT WITH GOLDEN LIMBS
AND GLEAMING FOOTFALLS TREADING FAERY SWARDS
VIRGIN MOTIONS OF BACCHANT INNOCENCES
677
WHO KNOW THEIR RIOT FOR A DANCE OF GOD
WHIRLED LINKED IN MOONLIT REVELS OF THE HEART
IMPECCABLE ARTISTS OF UNERRING FORMS
MAGICIAN BUILDERS OF SOUND AND RHYTHMIC WORDS
WIND-HAIRED GANDHARVAS CHANTED TO THE EAR
THE ODES THAT SHAPE THE UNIVERSAL THOUGHT
THE LINES THAT TEAR THE VEIL FROM DEITY'S FACE
THE RHYTHMS THAT BRING THE SOUNDS OF WISDOM'S SEA
IMMORTAL FIGURES AND ILLUMINED BROWS
OUR GREAT FOREFATHERS IN THOSE SPLENDOURS MOVED
TERMLESS IN POWER AND SATISFIED OF LIGHT
THEY ENJOYED THE SENSE OF ALL FOR WHICH WE STRIVE
HIGH SEERS MOVED POETS SAW THE ETERNAL THOUGHTS
THAT TRAVELLERS FROM ON HIGH ARRIVE TO US
DEFORMED BY OUR SEARCH TRICKED BY COSTUMING MIND
LIKE GODS DISFIGURED BY THE PANGS OF BIRTH
SEIZED THE GREAT WORDS WHICH NOW ARE FRAIL SOUNDS CAUGHT
BY DIFFICULT RAPTURE ON A MORTAL TONGUE
THE STRONG WHO STUMBLE AND SIN WERE CALM PROUD GODS
THERE LIGHTNING-FILLED WITH GLORY AND WITH FLAME
MELTING IN WAVES OF SYMPATHY AND SIGHT
SMITTEN LIKE A LYRE THAT THROBS TO OTHERS' BLISS
DRAWN BY THE CORDS OF ECSTASIES UNKNOWN
HER HUMAN NATURE FAINT WITH HEAVEN'S DELIGHT
SHE BEHELD THE CLASP TO EARTH DENIED AND BORE
THE IMPERISHABLE EYES OF VEILLESS LOVE
MORE CLIMBED ABOVE LEVEL TO LEVEL REACHED
BEYOND WHAT TONGUE CAN UTTER OR MIND DREAM
WORLDS OF AN INFINITE REACH CROWNED NATURE'S STIR
THERE WAS A GREATER TRANQUIL SWEETNESS THERE
A SUBTLER AND PROFOUNDER ETHER'S FIELD
AND MIGHTIER SCHEME THAN HEAVENLIEST SENSE CAN GIVE
THERE BREATH CARRIED A STREAM OF SEEING MIND
FORM WAS A TENUOUS RAIMENT OF THE SOUL
COLOUR WAS A VISIBLE TONE OF ECSTASY
SHAPES SEEN HALF IMMATERIAL BY THE GAZE
678
AND YET VOLUPTUOUSLY PALPABLE
MADE SENSIBLE TO TOUCH THE INDWELLING SPIRIT
THE HIGH PERFECTED SENSE ILLUMINED LIVED
A HAPPY VASSAL OF THE INNER RAY
EACH FEELING WAS THE ETERNAL'S MIGHTY CHILD
AND EVERY THOUGHT WAS A SWEET BURNING GOD
AIR WAS A LUMINOUS FEELING SOUND A VOICE
SUNLIGHT THE SOUL'S VISION AND MOONLIGHT ITS DREAM
ON A WIDE LIVING BASE OF WORDLESS CALM
ALL WAS A POTENT AND A LUCID JOY
INTO THOSE HEIGHTS HER SPIRIT WENT FLOATING UP
LIKE AN UPSOARING BIRD WHO MOUNTS UNSEEN
VOICING TO THE ASCENT HIS THROBBING HEART
OF MELODY TILL A PAUSE OF CLOSING WINGS
COMES QUIVERING IN HIS LAST CONTENTED CRY
AND HE IS SILENT WITH HIS SOUL DISCHARGED
DELIVERED OF HIS HEART'S BURDEN OF DELIGHT
EXPERIENCE MOUNTED ON JOY'S COLOURED BREAST
TO INACCESSIBLE SPHERES IN SPIRAL FLIGHT
THERE TIME DWELT WITH ETERNITY AS ONE
IMMENSE FELICITY JOINED RAPT REPOSE
AS ONE DROWNED IN A SEA OF SPLENDOUR AND BLISS
MUTE IN THE MAZE OF THESE SURPRISING WORLDS
TURNING SHE SAW THEIR LIVING KNOT AND SOURCE
KEY TO THEIR CHARM AND FOUNT OF THEIR DELIGHT
AND KNEW HIM FOR THE SAME WHO SNARES OUR LIVES
CAPTURED IN HIS TERRIFYING PITILESS NET
AND MAKES THE UNIVERSE HIS PRISON CAMP
AND MAKES IN HIS IMMENSE AND VACANT VASTS
THE LABOUR OF THE STARS A CIRCUIT VAIN
AND DEATH THE END OF EVERY HUMAN ROAD
AND GRIEF AND PAIN THE WAGES OF MAN'S TOIL
ONE WHOM HER SOUL HAD FACED AS DEATH AND NIGHT
A SUM OF ALL SWEETNESS GATHERED INTO HIS LIMBS
AND BLINDED HER HEART TO THE BEAUTY OF THE SUNS
679
TRANSFIGURED WAS THE FORMIDABLE SHAPE
HIS DARKNESS AND HIS SAD DESTROYING MIGHT
ABOLISHING FOR EVER AND DISCLOSING
THE MYSTERY OF HIS HIGH AND VIOLENT DEEDS
A SECRET SPLENDOUR ROSE REVEALED TO SIGHT
WHERE ONCE THE VAST EMBODIED VOID HAD STOOD
NIGHT THE DIM MASK HAD GROWN A WONDERFUL FACE
THE VAGUE INFINITY WAS SLAIN WHOSE GLOOM
HAD OUTLINED FROM THE TERRIBLE UNKNOWN
THE OBSCURE DISASTROUS FIGURE OF A GOD
FLED WAS THE ERROR THAT ARMS THE HANDS OF GRIEF
AND LIGHTED THE IGNORANT GULF WHOSE HOLLOW DEEPS
HAD GIVEN TO NOTHINGNESS A DREADFUL VOICE
AS WHEN BEFORE THE EYE THAT WAKES IN SLEEP
IS OPENED THE SOMBRE BINDING OF A BOOK
ILLUMINED LETTERINGS ARE SEEN WHICH KEPT
A GOLDEN BLAZE OF THOUGHT INSCRIBED WITHIN
A MARVELLOUS FORM RESPONDED TO HER GAZE
WHOSE SWEETNESS JUSTIFIED LIFE'S BLINDEST PAIN
ALL NATURE'S STRUGGLE WAS ITS EASY PRICE
THE UNIVERSE AND ITS AGONY SEEMED WORTH WHILE
AS IF THE CHORIC CALYX OF A FLOWER
AERIAL VISIBLE ON MUSIC'S WAVES
A LOTUS OF LIGHT-PETALLED ECSTASY
TOOK SHAPE OUT OF THE TREMULOUS HEART OF THINGS
THERE WAS NO MORE THE TORMENT UNDER THE STARS
THE EVIL SHELTERED BEHIND NATURE'S MASK
THERE WAS NO MORE THE DARK PRETENCE OF HATE
THE CRUEL RICTUS ON LOVE'S ALTERED FACE
HATE WAS THE GRIP OF A DREADFUL AMOUR'S STRIFE
A RUTHLESS LOVE INTENT ONLY TO POSSESS
HAS HERE REPLACED THE SWEET ORIGINAL GOD
FORGETTING THE WILL-TO-LOVE THAT GAVE IT BIRTH
THE PASSION TO LOCK ITSELF IN AND TO UNITE
IT WOULD SWALLOW ALL INTO ONE LONELY SELF
DEVOURING THE SOUL THAT IT HAD MADE ITS OWN
680
BY SUFFERING AND ANNIHILATION'S PAIN
PUNISHING THE UNWILLINGNESS TO BE ONE
ANGRY WITH THE REFUSALS OF THE WORLD
PASSIONATE TO TAKE BUT KNOWING NOT HOW TO GIVE
DEATH'S SOMBRE COWL WAS CAST FROM NATURE'S BROW
THERE LIGHTENED ON HER THE GODHEAD'S LURKING LAUGH
ALL GRACE AND GLORY AND ALL DIVINITY
WERE HERE COLLECTED IN A SINGLE FORM
ALL WORSHIPPED EYES LOOKED THROUGH HIS FROM ONE FACE
HE BORE ALL GODHEADS IN HIS GRANDIOSE LIMBS
AN OCEANIC SPIRIT DWELT WITHIN
INTOLERANT AND INVINCIBLE IN JOY
A FLOOD OF FREEDOM AND TRANSCENDENT BLISS
INTO IMMORTAL LINES OF BEAUTY ROSE
IN HIM THE FOURFOLD BEING BORE ITS CROWN
THAT WEARS THE MYSTERY OF A NAMELESS NAME
THE UNIVERSE WRITING ITS TREMENDOUS SENSE
IN THE INEXHAUSTIBLE MEANING OF A WORD
IN HIM THE ARCHITECT OF THE VISIBLE WORLD
AT ONCE THE ART AND ARTIST OF HIS WORKS
SPIRIT AND SEER AND THINKER OF THINGS SEEN
VIRAT WHO LIGHTS HIS CAMP-FIRES IN THE SUNS
AND THE STAR-ENTANGLED ETHER IS HIS HOLD
EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH MATTER FOR HIS SPEECH
OBJECTS ARE HIS LETTERS FORCES ARE HIS WORDS
EVENTS ARE THE CROWDED HISTORY OF HIS LIFE
AND SEA AND LAND ARE THE PAGES FOR HIS TALE
MATTER IS HIS MEANS AND HIS SPIRITUAL SIGN
HE HANGS THE THOUGHT UPON A LASH'S LIFT
IN THE CURRENT OF THE BLOOD MAKES FLOW THE SOUL
HIS IS THE DUMB WILL OF ATOM AND OF CLOD
A WILL THAT WITHOUT SENSE OR MOTIVE ACTS
AN INTELLIGENCE NEEDING NOT TO THINK OR PLAN
THE WORLD CREATES ITSELF INVINCIBLY
FOR ITS BODY IS THE BODY OF THE LORD
AND IN ITS HEART STANDS VIRAT KING OF KINGS
681
IN HIM SHADOWS HIS FORM THE GOLDEN CHILD
WHO IN THE SUN-CAPPED VAST CRADLES HIS BIRTH
HIRANYAGARBHA AUTHOR OF THOUGHTS AND DREAMS
WHO SEES THE INVISIBLE AND HEARS THE SOUNDS
THAT NEVER VISITED A MORTAL EAR
DISCOVERER OF UNTHOUGHT REALITIES
TRUER TO TRUTH THAN ALL WE HAVE EVER KNOWN
HE IS THE LEADER ON THE INNER ROADS
A SEER HE HAS ENTERED THE FORBIDDEN REALMS
A MAGICIAN WITH THE OMNIPOTENT WAND OF THOUGHT
HE BUILDS THE SECRET UNCREATED WORLDS
ARMED WITH THE GOLDEN SPEECH THE DIAMOND EYE
HIS IS THE VISION AND THE PROPHECY
IMAGIST CASTING THE FORMLESS INTO SHAPE
TRAVELLER AND HEWER OF THE UNSEEN PATHS
HE IS THE CARRIER OF THE HIDDEN FIRE
HE IS THE VOICE OF THE INEFFABLE
HE IS THE INVISIBLE HUNTER OF THE LIGHT
THE ANGEL OF MYSTERIOUS ECSTASIES
THE CONQUEROR OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE SOUL
A THIRD SPIRIT STOOD BEHIND THEIR HIDDEN CAUSE
A MASS OF SUPERCONSCIENCE CLOSED IN LIGHT
CREATOR OF THINGS IN HIS ALL-KNOWING SLEEP
ALL FROM HIS STILLNESS CAME AS GROWS A TREE
HE IS OUR SEED AND CORE OUR HEAD AND BASE
ALL LIGHT IS BUT A FLASH FROM HIS CLOSED EYES
AN ALL-WISE TRUTH IS MYSTIC IN HIS HEART
THE OMNISCIENT RAY IS SHUT BEHIND HIS LIDS
HE IS THE WISDOM THAT COMES NOT BY THOUGHT
HIS WORDLESS SILENCE BRINGS THE IMMORTAL WORD
HE SLEEPS IN THE ATOM AND THE BURNING STAR
HE SLEEPS IN MAN AND GOD AND BEAST AND STONE
BECAUSE HE IS THERE THE INCONSCIENT DOES ITS WORK
BECAUSE HE IS THERE THE WORLD FORGETS TO DIE
HE IS THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE OF GOD
HE THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF NATURE'S RUN
682
HIS SLUMBER IS AN ALMIGHTINESS IN THINGS
AWAKE HE IS THE ETERNAL AND SUPREME
ABOVE WAS THE BROODING BLISS OF THE INFINITE
ITS OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT REPOSE
ITS IMMOBILE SILENCE ABSOLUTE AND ALONE
ALL POWERS WERE WOVEN IN COUNTLESS CONCORDS HERE
THE BLISS THAT MADE THE WORLD IN HIS BODY LIVED
LOVE AND DELIGHT WERE THE HEAD OF THE SWEET FORM
IN THE ALLURING MESHES OF THEIR SNARE
RECAPTURED THE PROUD BLISSFUL MEMBERS HELD
ALL JOYS OUTRUNNERS OF THE PANTING HEART
AND FUGITIVE FROM LIFE'S OUTSTRIPPED DESIRE
WHATEVER VISION HAS ESCAPED THE EYE
WHATEVER HAPPINESS COMES IN DREAM AND TRANCE
THE NECTAR SPILLED BY LOVE WITH TREMBLING HANDS
THE JOY THE CUP OF NATURE CANNOT HOLD
HAD CROWDED TO THE BEAUTY OF HIS FACE
WERE WAITING IN THE HONEY OF HIS LAUGH
THINGS HIDDEN BY THE SILENCE OF THE HOURS
THE IDEAS THAT FIND NO VOICE ON LIVING LIPS
THE SOUL'S PREGNANT MEETING WITH INFINITY
HAD COME TO BIRTH IN HIM AND TAKEN FIRE
THE SECRET WHISPER OF THE FLOWER AND STAR
REVEALED ITS MEANING IN HIS FATHOMLESS LOOK
HIS LIPS CURVED ELOQUENT LIKE A ROSE OF DAWN
HIS SMILE THAT PLAYED WITH THE WONDER OF THE MIND
AND STAYED IN THE HEART WHEN IT HAD LEFT HIS MOUTH
GLIMMERED WITH THE RADIANCE OF THE MORNING STAR
GEMMING THE WIDE DISCOVERY OF HEAVEN
HIS GAZE WAS THE REGARD OF ETERNITY
THE SPIRIT OF ITS SWEET AND CALM INTENT
WAS A WISE HOME OF GLADNESS AND DIVULGED
THE LIGHT OF THE AGES IN THE MIRTH OF THE HOURS
A SUN OF WISDOM IN A MIRACLED GROVE
IN THE ORCHESTRAL LARGENESS OF HIS MIND
ALL CONTRARY SEEKINGS THEIR CLOSE KINSHIP KNEW
683
RICH-HEARTED WONDERFUL TO EACH OTHER MET
IN THE MUTUAL MARVELLING OF THEIR MYRIAD NOTES
AND DWELT LIKE BROTHERS OF ONE FAMILY
WHO HAD FOUND THEIR COMMON AND MYSTERIOUS HOME
AS FROM THE HARP OF SOME ECSTATIC GOD
THERE SPRINGS A HARMONY OF LYRIC BLISS
STRIVING TO LEAVE NO HEAVENLY JOY UNSUNG
SUCH WAS THE LIFE IN THAT EMBODIED LIGHT
HE SEEMED THE WIDENESS OF A BOUNDLESS SKY
HE SEEMED THE PASSION OF A SORROWLESS EARTH
HE SEEMED THE BURNING OF A WORLD-WIDE SUN
TWO LOOKED UPON EACH OTHER SOUL SAW SOUL
THEN LIKE AN ANTHEM FROM THE HEART'S LUCENT CAVE
A VOICE SOARED UP WHOSE MAGIC SOUND COULD TURN
THE POIGNANT WEEPING OF THE EARTH TO SOBS
OF RAPTURE AND HER CRY TO SPIRIT SONG
O HUMAN IMAGE OF THE DEATHLESS WORD
HOW HAST THOU SEEN BEYOND THE TOPAZ WALLS
THE GLEAMING SISTERS OF THE DIVINE GATE
SUMMONED THE GENII OF THEIR WAKEFUL SLEEP
AND UNDER REVELATION'S ARCHES FORCED
THE CARVED THOUGHT-SHROUDED DOORS TO SWING APART
UNLOCKED THE AVENUES OF SPIRITUAL SIGHT
AND TAUGHT THE ENTRIES OF A HEAVENLIER STATE
TO THY RAPT SOUL THAT BORE THE GOLDEN KEY
IN THEE THE SECRET SIGHT MAN'S BLINDNESS MISSED
HAS OPENED ITS VIEW PAST TIME MY CHARIOT-COURSE
AND DEATH MY TUNNEL WHICH I DRIVE THROUGH LIFE
TO REACH MY UNSEEN DISTANCES OF BLISS
I AM THE HUSHED SEARCH OF THE JEALOUS GODS
PURSUING MY WISDOM'S VAST MYSTERIOUS WORK
SEIZED IN THE THOUSAND MEETING WAYS OF HEAVEN
I AM THE BEAUTY OF THE UNVEILED RAY
DRAWING THROUGH THE DEEP ROADS OF THE INFINITE NIGHT
THE UNCONQUERABLE PILGRIM SOUL OF EARTH
684
BENEATH THE FLARING TORCHES OF THE STARS
I AM THE INVIOLABLE ECSTASY
THEY WHO HAVE LOOKED ON ME SHALL GRIEVE NO MORE
THE EYES THAT LIVE IN NIGHT SHALL SEE MY FORM
ON THE PALE SHORES OF FOAMING STEELY STRAITS
THAT FLOW BENEATH A GREY TORMENTED SKY
TWO POWERS FROM ONE ORIGINAL ECSTASY BORN
PACE NEAR BUT PARTED IN THE LIFE OF MAN
ONE LEANS TO EARTH THE OTHER YEARNS TO THE SKIES
HEAVEN IN ITS RAPTURE DREAMS OF PERFECT EARTH
EARTH IN ITS SORROW DREAMS OF PERFECT HEAVEN
THE TWO LONGING TO JOIN YET WALK APART
IDLY DIVIDED BY THEIR VAIN CONCEITS
THEY ARE KEPT FROM THEIR ONENESS BY ENCHANTED FEARS
SUNDERED MYSTERIOUSLY BY MILES OF THOUGHT
THEY GAZE ACROSS THE SILENT GULFS OF SLEEP
OR SIDE BY SIDE RECLINED UPON MY VASTS
LIKE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM MAGICALLY DIVORCED
THEY WAKE TO YEARN BUT NEVER CAN THEY CLASP
WHILE THINLY FLICKERING HESITATES UNCROSSED
BETWEEN THE LOVERS ON THEIR NUPTIAL COUCH
THE SHADOWY EIDOLON OF A SWORD
BUT WHEN THE PHANTOM FLAME-EDGE FAILS UNDONE
THEN NEVER MORE CAN SPACE OR TIME DIVIDE
THE LOVER FROM THE LOVED SPACE SHALL DRAW BACK
HER GREAT TRANSLUCENT CURTAIN TIME SHALL BE
THE QUIVERING OF THE SPIRIT'S ENDLESS BLISS
ATTEND THAT MOMENT OF CELESTIAL FATE
MEANWHILE YOU TWO SHALL SERVE THE DUAL LAW
WHICH ONLY NOW THE SCOUTS OF VISION GLIMPSE
WHO PRESSING THROUGH THE FOREST OF THEIR THOUGHTS
HAVE FOUND THE NARROW BRIDGES OF THE GODS
WAIT PATIENT OF THE BRITTLE BARS OF FORM
MAKING DIVISION YOUR DELIGHTFUL MEANS
OF HAPPY ONENESS RAPTUROUSLY ENHANCED
BY ATTRACTION IN THE THROBBING AIR BETWEEN
685
YET IF THOU WOULDST ABANDON THE VEXED WORLD
CARELESS OF THE DARK MOAN OF THINGS BELOW
TREAD DOWN THE ISTHMUS OVERLEAP THE FLOOD
CANCEL THY CONTRACT WITH THE LABOURING FORCE
RENOUNCE THE TIE THAT JOINS THEE TO EARTH-KIND
CAST OFF THY SYMPATHY WITH MORTAL HEARTS
ARISE VINDICATE THY SPIRIT'S CONQUERED RIGHT
RELINQUISHING THY CHARGE OF TRANSIENT BREATH
UNDER THE COLD GAZE OF THE INDIFFERENT STARS
LEAVING THY BORROWED BODY ON THE SOD
ASCEND O SOUL INTO THY BLISSFUL HOME
HERE IN THE PLAYGROUND OF THE ETERNAL CHILD
OR IN DOMAINS THE WISE IMMORTALS TREAD
ROAM WITH THY COMRADE SPLENDOUR UNDER SKIES
SPIRITUAL LIT BY AN UNSETTING SUN
AS GODHEADS LIVE WHO CARE NOT FOR THE WORLD
AND SHARE NOT IN THE TOIL OF NATURE'S POWERS
ABSORBED IN THEIR SELF-ECSTASY THEY DWELL
CAST OFF THE AMBIGUOUS MYTH OF EARTH'S DESIRE
O IMMORTAL TO FELICITY ARISE
ON SAVITRI LISTENING IN HER TRANQUIL HEART
TO THE HARMONY OF THE ENSNARING VOICE
A JOY EXCEEDING EARTH'S AND HEAVEN'S POURED DOWN
THE BLISS OF AN UNKNOWN ETERNITY
A RAPTURE FROM SOME WAITING INFINITE
A SMILE CAME RIPPLING OUT IN HER WIDE EYES
ITS CONFIDENT FELICITY'S MESSENGER
AS IF THE FIRST BEAM OF THE MORNING SUN
RIPPLED ALONG TWO WAKENED LOTUS-POOLS
O BESETTER OF MAN'S SOUL WITH LIFE AND DEATH
AND THE WORLD'S PLEASURE AND PAIN AND DAY AND NIGHT
TEMPTING HIS HEART WITH THE FAR LURE OF HEAVEN
TESTING HIS STRENGTH WITH THE CLOSE TOUCH OF HELL
I CLIMB NOT TO THY EVERLASTING DAY
EVEN AS I HAVE SHUNNED THY ETERNAL NIGHT
TO ME WHO TURN NOT FROM THY TERRESTRIAL WAY
686
GIVE BACK THE OTHER SELF MY NATURE ASKS
THY SPACES NEED HIM NOT TO HELP THEIR JOY
EARTH NEEDS HIS BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT MADE BY THEE
TO FLING DELIGHT DOWN LIKE A NET OF GOLD
EARTH IS THE CHOSEN PLACE OF MIGHTIEST SOULS
EARTH IS THE HEROIC SPIRIT'S BATTLEFIELD
THE FORGE WHERE THE ARCHMASON SHAPES HIS WORKS
THY SERVITUDES ON EARTH ARE GREATER KING
THAN ALL THE GLORIOUS LIBERTIES OF HEAVEN
THE HEAVENS WERE ONCE TO ME MY NATURAL HOME
I TOO HAVE WANDERED IN STAR-JEWELLED GROVES
PACED SUN-GOLD PASTURES AND MOON-SILVER SWARDS
AND HEARD THE HARPING LAUGHTER OF THEIR STREAMS
AND LINGERED UNDER BRANCHES DROPPING MYRRH
I TOO HAVE REVELLED IN THE FIELDS OF LIGHT
TOUCHED BY THE ETHEREAL RAIMENT OF THE WINDS
THY WONDER-ROUNDS OF MUSIC I HAVE TROD
LIVED IN THE RHYME OF BRIGHT UNLABOURING THOUGHTS
I HAVE BEAT SWIFT HARMONIES OF RAPTURE VAST
DANCED IN SPONTANEOUS MEASURES OF THE SOUL
THE GREAT AND EASY DANCES OF THE GODS
O FRAGRANT ARE THE LANES THY CHILDREN WALK
AND LOVELY IS THE MEMORY OF THEIR FEET
AMID THE WONDER-FLOWERS OF PARADISE
A HEAVIER TREAD IS MINE A MIGHTIER TOUCH
THERE WHERE THE GODS AND DEMONS BATTLE IN NIGHT
OR WRESTLE ON THE BORDERS OF THE SUN
TAUGHT BY THE SWEETNESS AND THE PAIN OF LIFE
TO BEAR THE UNEVEN STRENUOUS BEAT THAT THROBS
AGAINST THE EDGE OF SOME DIVINEST HOPE
TO DARE THE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THESE PANGS OF SEARCH
IN ME THE SPIRIT OF IMMORTAL LOVE
STRETCHES ITS ARMS OUT TO EMBRACE MANKIND
TOO FAR THY HEAVENS FOR ME FROM SUFFERING MEN
IMPERFECT IS THE JOY NOT SHARED BY ALL
O TO SPREAD FORTH O TO ENCIRCLE AND SEIZE
687
MORE HEARTS TILL LOVE IN US HAS FILLED THY WORLD
O LIFE THE LIFE BENEATH THE WHEELING STARS
FOR VICTORY IN THE TOURNAMENT WITH DEATH
FOR BENDING OF THE FIERCE AND DIFFICULT BOW
FOR FLASHING OF THE SPLENDID SWORD OF GOD
O THOU WHO SOUNDST THE TRUMPET IN THE LISTS
PART NOT THE HANDLE FROM THE UNTRIED STEEL
TAKE NOT THE WARRIOR WITH HIS BLOW UNSTRUCK
ARE THERE NOT STILL A MILLION FIGHTS TO WAGE
O KING-SMITH CLANG ON STILL THY TOIL BEGUN
WELD US TO ONE IN THY STRONG SMITHY OF LIFE
THY FINE-CURVED JEWELLED HILT CALL SAVITRI
THY BLADE'S EXULTANT SMILE NAME SATYAVAN
FASHION TO BEAUTY POINT US THROUGH THE WORLD
BREAK NOT THE LYRE BEFORE THE SONG IS FOUND
ARE THERE NOT STILL UNNUMBERED CHANTS TO WEAVE
O SUBTLE-SOULED MUSICIAN OF THE YEARS
PLAY OUT WHAT THOU HAST FLUTED ON MY STOPS
ARISE FROM THE STRAIN THEIR FIRST WILD PLAINT DIVINED
AND THAT DISCOVER WHICH IS YET UNSUNG
I KNOW THAT I CAN LIFT MAN'S SOUL TO GOD
I KNOW THAT HE CAN BRING THE IMMORTAL DOWN
OUR WILL LABOURS PERMITTED BY THY WILL
AND WITHOUT THEE AN EMPTY ROAR OF STORM
A SENSELESS WHIRLWIND IS THE TITAN'S FORCE
AND WITHOUT THEE A SNARE THE STRENGTH OF GODS
LET NOT THE INCONSCIENT GULF SWALLOW MAN'S RACE
THAT THROUGH EARTH'S IGNORANCE STRUGGLES TOWARDS THY LIGHT
O THUNDERER WITH THE LIGHTNINGS OF THE SOUL
GIVE NOT TO DARKNESS AND TO DEATH THY SUN
ACHIEVE THY WISDOM'S HIDDEN FIRM DECREE
AND THE MANDATE OF THY SECRET WORLD-WIDE LOVE
HER WORDS FAILED LOST IN THOUGHT'S IMMENSITIES
WHICH SEIZED THEM AT THE LIMITS OF THEIR CRY
AND HID THEIR MEANING IN THE DISTANCES
THAT STIR TO MORE THAN EVER SPEECH HAS WON
688
FROM THE UNTHINKABLE END OF ALL OUR THOUGHT
AND THE INEFFABLE FROM WHOM ALL WORDS COME
THEN WITH A SMILE AUGUST AS NOONDAY HEAVENS
THE GODHEAD OF THE VISION WONDERFUL
HOW SHALL EARTH-NATURE AND MAN'S NATURE RISE
TO THE CELESTIAL LEVELS YET EARTH ABIDE
HEAVEN AND EARTH TOWARDS EACH OTHER GAZE
ACROSS A GULF THAT FEW CAN CROSS NONE TOUCH
ARRIVING THROUGH A VAGUE ETHEREAL MIST
OUT OF WHICH ALL THINGS FORM THAT MOVE IN SPACE
THE SHORE THAT ALL CAN SEE BUT NEVER REACH
HEAVEN'S LIGHT VISITS SOMETIMES THE MIND OF EARTH
ITS THOUGHTS BURN IN HER SKY LIKE LONELY STARS
IN HER HEART THERE MOVE CELESTIAL SEEKINGS SOFT
AND BEAUTIFUL LIKE FLUTTERING WINGS OF BIRDS
VISIONS OF JOY THAT SHE CAN NEVER WIN
TRAVERSE THE FADING MIRROR OF HER DREAMS
FAINT SEEDS OF LIGHT AND BLISS BEAR SORROWFUL FLOWERS
FAINT HARMONIES CAUGHT FROM A HALF-HEARD SONG
FALL SWOONING MID THE WANDERING VOICES' JAR
FOAM FROM THE TOSSING LUMINOUS SEAS WHERE DWELLS
THE BEAUTIFUL AND FAR DELIGHT OF GODS
RAPTURES UNKNOWN A MIRACLED HAPPINESS
THRILL HER AND PASS HALF-SHAPED TO MIND AND SENSE
ABOVE HER LITTLE FINITE STEPS SHE FEELS
CARELESS OF KNOT OR PAUSE WORLDS WHICH WEAVE OUT
A STRANGE PERFECTION BEYOND LAW AND RULE
A UNIVERSE OF SELF-FOUND FELICITY
AN INEXPRESSIBLE RHYTHM OF TIMELESS BEATS
THE MANY-MOVEMENTED HEART-BEATS OF THE ONE
MAGIC OF THE BOUNDLESS HARMONIES OF SELF
ORDER OF THE FREEDOM OF THE INFINITE
THE WONDER-PLASTICS OF THE ABSOLUTE
THERE IS THE ALL-TRUTH AND THERE THE TIMELESS BLISS
BUT HERS ARE FRAGMENTS OF A STAR-LOST GLEAM
689
HERS ARE BUT CARELESS VISITS OF THE GODS
THEY ARE A LIGHT THAT FAILS A WORD SOON HUSHED
AND NOTHING THEY MEAN CAN STAY FOR LONG ON EARTH
THERE ARE HIGH GLIMPSES NOT THE LASTING SIGHT
A FEW CAN CLIMB TO AN UNPERISHING SUN
OR LIVE ON THE EDGES OF THE MYSTIC MOON
AND CHANNEL TO EARTH-MIND THE WIZARD RAY
THE HEROES AND THE DEMIGODS ARE FEW
TO WHOM THE CLOSE IMMORTAL VOICES SPEAK
AND TO THEIR ACTS THE HEAVENLY CLAN ARE NEAR
FEW ARE THE SILENCES IN WHICH TRUTH IS HEARD
UNVEILING THE TIMELESS UTTERANCE IN HER DEEPS
FEW ARE THE SPLENDID MOMENTS OF THE SEERS
HEAVEN'S CALL IS RARE RARER THE HEART THAT HEEDS
THE DOORS OF LIGHT ARE SEALED TO COMMON MIND
AND EARTH'S NEEDS NAIL TO EARTH THE HUMAN MASS
ONLY IN AN UPLIFTING HOUR OF STRESS
MEN ANSWER TO THE TOUCH OF GREATER THINGS
OR RAISED BY SOME STRONG HAND TO BREATHE HEAVEN-AIR
THEY SLIDE BACK TO THE MUD FROM WHICH THEY CLIMBED
IN THE MUD OF WHICH THEY ARE MADE WHOSE LAW THEY KNOW
THEY JOY IN SAFE RETURN TO A FRIENDLY BASE
AND THOUGH SOMETHING IN THEM WEEPS FOR GLORY LOST
AND GREATNESS MURDERED THEY ACCEPT THEIR FALL
TO BE THE COMMON MAN THEY THINK THE BEST
TO LIVE AS OTHERS LIVE IS THEIR DELIGHT
FOR MOST ARE BUILT ON NATURE'S EARLY PLAN
AND OWE SMALL DEBT TO A SUPERIOR PLANE
THE HUMAN AVERAGE IS THEIR LEVEL PITCH
A THINKING ANIMAL'S MATERIAL RANGE
IN THE LONG EVER-MOUNTING HIERARCHY
IN THE STARK ECONOMY OF COSMIC LIFE
EACH CREATURE TO ITS APPOINTED TASK AND PLACE
IS BOUND BY HIS NATURE'S FORM HIS SPIRIT'S FORCE
IF THIS WERE EASILY DISTURBED IT WOULD BREAK
THE SETTLED BALANCE OF CREATED THINGS
690
THE PERPETUAL ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE
WOULD TREMBLE AND A GAP YAWN IN WOVEN FATE
IF MEN WERE NOT AND ALL WERE BRILLIANT GODS
THE MEDIATING STAIR WOULD THEN BE LOST
BY WHICH THE SPIRIT AWAKE IN MATTER WINDS
ACCEPTING THE CIRCUITS OF THE MIDDLE WAY
BY HEAVY TOIL AND SLOW AEONIC STEPS
REACHING THE BRIGHT MIRACULOUS FRINGE OF GOD
INTO THE GLORY OF THE OVERSOUL
MY WILL MY CALL IS THERE IN MEN AND THINGS
BUT THE INCONSCIENT LIES AT THE WORLD'S GREY BACK
AND DRAWS TO ITS BREAST OF NIGHT AND DEATH AND SLEEP
IMPRISONED IN ITS DARK AND DUMB ABYSS
A LITTLE CONSCIOUSNESS IT LETS ESCAPE
BUT JEALOUS OF THE GROWING LIGHT HOLDS BACK
CLOSE TO THE OBSCURE EDGES OF ITS CAVE
AS IF A FOND IGNORANT MOTHER KEPT HER CHILD
TIED TO HER APRON STRINGS OF NESCIENCE
THE INCONSCIENT COULD NOT READ WITHOUT MAN'S MIND
THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD ITS SLEEP HAS MADE
MAN IS ITS KEY TO UNLOCK A CONSCIOUS DOOR
BUT STILL IT HOLDS HIM DANGLED IN ITS GRASP
IT DRAWS ITS GIANT CIRCLE ROUND HIS THOUGHTS
IT SHUTS HIS HEART TO THE SUPERNAL LIGHT
A HIGH AND DAZZLING LIMIT SHINES ABOVE
A BLACK AND BLINDING BORDER RULES BELOW
HIS MIND IS CLOSED BETWEEN TWO FIRMAMENTS
HE SEEKS THROUGH WORDS AND IMAGES THE TRUTH
AND PORING ON SURFACES AND BRUTE OUTSIDES
OR DIPPING CAUTIOUS FEET IN SHALLOW SEAS
EVEN HIS KNOWLEDGE IS AN IGNORANCE
HE IS BARRED OUT FROM HIS OWN INNER DEPTHS
HE CANNOT LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE UNKNOWN
HOW SHALL HE SEE WITH THE OMNISCIENT'S EYES
HOW SHALL HE WILL WITH THE OMNIPOTENT'S FORCE
O TOO COMPASSIONATE AND EAGER DAWN
691
LEAVE TO THE CIRCLING AEONS' TARDY PACE
AND TO THE WORKING OF THE INCONSCIENT WILL
LEAVE TO ITS IMPERFECT LIGHT THE EARTHLY RACE
ALL SHALL BE DONE BY THE LONG ACT OF TIME
ALTHOUGH THE RACE IS BOUND BY ITS OWN KIND
THE SOUL IN MAN IS GREATER THAN HIS FATE
ABOVE THE WASH AND SURGE OF TIME AND SPACE
DISENGAGING FROM THE COSMIC COMMONALTY
BY WHICH ALL LIFE IS KIN IN GRIEF AND JOY
DELIVERED FROM THE UNIVERSAL LAW
THE SUNLIKE SINGLE AND TRANSCENDENT SPIRIT
CAN BLAZE ITS WAY THROUGH THE MIND'S BARRIER WALL
AND BURN ALONE IN THE ETERNAL SKY
INHABITANT OF A WIDE AND ENDLESS CALM
O FLAME WITHDRAW INTO THY LUMINOUS SELF
OR ELSE RETURN TO THY ORIGINAL MIGHT
ON A SEER-SUMMIT ABOVE THOUGHT AND WORLD
PARTNER OF MY UNHOURED ETERNITY
BE ONE WITH THE INFINITY OF MY POWER
FOR THOU ART THE WORLD-MOTHER AND THE BRIDE
OUT OF THE FRUITLESS YEARNING OF EARTH'S LIFE
OUT OF HER FEEBLE UNCONVINCING DREAM
RECOVERING WINGS THAT CROSS INFINITY
PASS BACK INTO THE POWER FROM WHICH THOU CAM'ST
TO THAT THOU CANST UPLIFT THY FORMLESS FLIGHT
THY HEART CAN RISE FROM ITS UNSATISFIED BEATS
AND FEEL THE IMMORTAL AND SPIRITUAL JOY
OF A SOUL THAT NEVER LOST FELICITY
LIFT UP THE FALLEN HEART OF LOVE WHICH FLUTTERS
CAST DOWN DESIRE'S ABYSS INTO THE GULFS
FOR EVER RESCUED OUT OF NATURE'S SHAPES
DISCOVER WHAT THE AIMLESS CYCLES WANT
THERE INTERTWINED WITH ALL THY LIFE HAS MEANT
HERE VAINLY SOUGHT IN A TERRESTRIAL FORM
BREAK INTO ETERNITY THY MORTAL MOULD
MELT LIGHTNING INTO THY INVISIBLE FLAME
692
CLASP OCEAN DEEP INTO THYSELF THY WAVE
HAPPY FOR EVER IN THE EMBOSOMING SURGE
GROW ONE WITH THE STILL PASSION OF THE DEPTHS
THEN SHALT THOU KNOW THE LOVER AND THE LOVED
LEAVING THE LIMITS DIVIDING HIM AND THEE
RECEIVE HIM INTO BOUNDLESS SAVITRI
LOSE THYSELF INTO INFINITE SATYAVAN
O MIRACLE WHERE THOU BEGANST THERE CEASE
BUT SAVITRI ANSWERED TO THE RADIANT GOD
IN VAIN THOU TEMPTST WITH SOLITARY BLISS
TWO SPIRITS SAVED OUT OF A SUFFERING WORLD
MY SOUL AND HIS INDISSOLUBLY LINKED
IN THE ONE TASK FOR WHICH OUR LIVES WERE BORN
TO RAISE THE WORLD TO GOD IN DEATHLESS LIGHT
TO BRING GOD DOWN TO THE WORLD ON EARTH WE CAME
TO CHANGE THE EARTHLY LIFE TO LIFE DIVINE
I KEEP MY WILL TO SAVE THE WORLD AND MAN
EVEN THE CHARM OF THY ALLURING VOICE
O BLISSFUL GODHEAD CANNOT SEIZE AND SNARE
I SACRIFICE NOT EARTH TO HAPPIER WORLDS
BECAUSE THERE DWELT THE ETERNAL'S VAST IDEA
AND HIS DYNAMIC WILL IN MEN AND THINGS
SO ONLY COULD THE ENORMOUS SCENE BEGIN
WHENCE CAME THIS PROFITLESS WILDERNESS OF STARS
THIS MIGHTY BARREN WHEELING OF THE SUNS
WHO MADE THE SOUL OF FUTILE LIFE IN TIME
PLANTED A PURPOSE AND A HOPE IN THE HEART
SET NATURE TO A HUGE AND MEANINGLESS TASK
OR PLANNED HER MILLION-AEONED EFFORT'S WASTE
WHAT FORCE CONDEMNED TO BIRTH AND DEATH AND TEARS
THESE CONSCIOUS CREATURES CRAWLING ON THE GLOBE
IF EARTH CAN LOOK UP TO THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN
AND HEAR AN ANSWER TO HER LONELY CRY
NOT VAIN THEIR MEETING NOR HEAVEN'S TOUCH A SNARE
IF THOU AND I ARE TRUE THE WORLD IS TRUE
ALTHOUGH THOU HIDE THYSELF BEHIND THY WORKS
693
TO BE IS NOT A SENSELESS PARADOX
SINCE GOD HAS MADE EARTH EARTH MUST MAKE IN HER GOD
WHAT HIDES WITHIN HER BREAST SHE MUST REVEAL
I CLAIM THEE FOR THE WORLD THAT THOU HAST MADE
IF MAN LIVES BOUND BY HIS HUMANITY
IF HE IS TIED FOR EVER TO HIS PAIN
LET A GREATER BEING THEN ARISE FROM MAN
THE SUPERHUMAN WITH THE ETERNAL MATE
AND THE IMMORTAL SHINE THROUGH EARTHLY FORMS
ELSE WERE CREATION VAIN AND THIS GREAT WORLD
A NOTHING THAT IN TIME'S MOMENTS SEEMS TO BE
BUT I HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE INSENTIENT MASK
I HAVE FELT A SECRET SPIRIT STIR IN THINGS
CARRYING THE BODY OF THE GROWING GOD
IT LOOKS THROUGH VEILING FORMS AT VEILLESS TRUTH
IT PUSHES BACK THE CURTAIN OF THE GODS
IT CLIMBS TOWARDS ITS OWN ETERNITY
BUT THE GOD ANSWERED TO THE WOMAN'S HEART
O LIVING POWER OF THE INCARNATE WORD
ALL THAT THE SPIRIT HAS DREAMED THOU CANST CREATE
THOU ART THE FORCE BY WHICH I MADE THE WORLDS
THOU ART MY VISION AND MY WILL AND VOICE
BUT KNOWLEDGE TOO IS THINE THE WORLD-PLAN THOU KNOWEST
AND THE TARDY PROCESS OF THE PACE OF TIME
IN THE IMPETUOUS DRIVE OF THY HEART OF FLAME
IN THY PASSION TO DELIVER MAN AND EARTH
INDIGNANT AT THE IMPEDIMENTS OF TIME
AND THE SLOW EVOLUTION'S SLUGGARD STEPS
LEAD NOT THE SPIRIT IN AN IGNORANT WORLD
TO DARE TOO SOON THE ADVENTURE OF THE LIGHT
PUSHING THE BOUND AND SLUMBERING GOD IN MAN
AWAKENED MID THE INEFFABLE SILENCES
INTO ENDLESS VISTAS OF THE UNKNOWN AND UNSEEN
ACROSS THE LAST CONFINES OF THE LIMITING MIND
AND THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S PERILOUS BORDER LINE
INTO THE DANGER OF THE INFINITE
694
BUT IF THOU WILT NOT WAIT FOR TIME AND GOD
DO THEN THY WORK AND FORCE THY WILL ON FATE
AS I HAVE TAKEN FROM THEE MY LOAD OF NIGHT
AND TAKEN FROM THEE MY TWILIGHT'S DOUBTS AND DREAMS
SO NOW I TAKE MY LIGHT OF UTTER DAY
THESE ARE MY SYMBOL KINGDOMS BUT NOT HERE
CAN THE GREAT CHOICE BE MADE THAT FIXES FATE
OR UTTERED THE SANCTION OF THE VOICE SUPREME
ARISE UPON A LADDER OF GREATER WORLDS
TO THE INFINITY WHERE NO WORLD CAN BE
BUT NOT IN THE WIDE AIR WHERE A GREATER LIFE
UPLIFTS ITS MYSTERY AND ITS MIRACLE
AND NOT ON THE LUMINOUS PEAKS OF SUMMIT MIND
OR IN THE HOLD WHERE SUBTLE MATTER'S SPIRIT
HIDES IN ITS LIGHT OF SHIMMERING SECRECIES
CAN THERE BE HEARD THE ETERNAL'S FIRM COMMAND
THAT JOINS THE HEAD OF DESTINY TO ITS BASE
THESE ONLY ARE THE MEDIATING LINKS
NOT THEIRS IS THE ORIGINATING SIGHT
NOR THE FULFILLING ACT OR LAST SUPPORT
THAT BEARS PERPETUALLY THE COSMIC PILE
TWO ARE THE POWERS THAT HOLD THE ENDS OF TIME
SPIRIT FORESEES MATTER UNFOLDS ITS THOUGHT
THE DUMB EXECUTOR OF GOD'S DECREES
OMITTING NO IOTA AND NO DOT
AGENT UNQUESTIONING INCONSCIENT STARK
EVOLVING INEVITABLY A CHARGED CONTENT
INTENTION OF HIS FORCE IN TIME AND SPACE
IN ANIMATE BEINGS AND INANIMATE THINGS
IMMUTABLY IT FULFILS ITS ORDERED TASK
IT CANCELS NOT A TITTLE OF THINGS DONE
UNSWERVING FROM THE ORACULAR COMMAND
IT ALTERS NOT THE STEPS OF THE UNSEEN
IF THOU MUST INDEED DELIVER MAN AND EARTH
ON THE SPIRITUAL HEIGHTS LOOK DOWN ON LIFE
DISCOVER THE TRUTH OF GOD AND MAN AND WORLD
695
THEN DO THY TASK KNOWING AND SEEING ALL
ASCEND O SOUL INTO THY TIMELESS SELF
CHOOSE DESTINY'S CURVE AND STAMP THY WILL ON TIME
HE ENDED AND UPON THE FALLING SOUND
A POWER WENT FORTH THAT SHOOK THE FOUNDED SPHERES
AND LOOSED THE STAKES THAT HOLD THE TENTS OF FORM
ABSOLVED FROM VISION'S GRIP AND THE FOLDS OF THOUGHT
RAPT FROM HER SENSE LIKE DISAPPEARING SCENES
IN THE STUPENDOUS THEATRE OF SPACE
THE HEAVEN-WORLDS VANISHED IN SPIRITUAL LIGHT
A MOVEMENT WAS ABROAD A CRY A WORD
BEGINNINGLESS IN ITS VAST DISCOVERY
MOMENTLESS IN ITS UNTHINKABLE RETURN
CHOIRED IN CALM SEAS SHE HEARD THE ETERNAL THOUGHT
RHYTHMING ITSELF ABROAD UNUTTERABLY
IN SPACELESS ORBITS AND ON TIMELESS ROADS
IN AN INEFFABLE WORLD SHE LIVED FULFILLED
AN ENERGY OF THE TRIUNE INFINITE
IN A MEASURELESS REALITY SHE DWELT
A RAPTURE AND A BEING AND A FORCE
A LINKED AND MYRIAD-MOTIONED PLENITUDE
A VIRGIN UNITY A LUMINOUS SPOUSE
HOUSING A MULTITUDINOUS EMBRACE
TO MARRY ALL IN GOD'S IMMENSE DELIGHT
BEARING THE ETERNITY OF EVERY SPIRIT
BEARING THE BURDEN OF UNIVERSAL LOVE
A WONDERFUL MOTHER OF UNNUMBERED SOULS
ALL THINGS SHE KNEW ALL THINGS IMAGINED OR WILLED
HER EAR WAS OPENED TO IDEAL SOUND
SHAPE THE CONVENTION BOUND NO MORE HER SIGHT
A THOUSAND DOORS OF ONENESS WAS HER HEART
A CRYPT AND SANCTUARY OF BROODING LIGHT
APPEARED THE LAST RECESS OF THINGS BEYOND
THEN IN ITS ROUNDS THE ENORMOUS FIAT PAUSED
SILENCE GAVE BACK TO THE UNKNOWABLE
ALL IT HAD GIVEN STILL WAS HER LISTENING THOUGHT
696
THE FORM OF THINGS HAD CEASED WITHIN HER SOUL
INVISIBLE THAT PERFECT GODHEAD NOW
AROUND HER SOME TREMENDOUS SPIRIT LIVED
MYSTERIOUS FLAME AROUND A MELTING PEARL
AND IN THE PHANTOM OF ABOLISHED SPACE
THERE WAS A VOICE UNHEARD BY EARS THAT CRIED
CHOOSE SPIRIT THY SUPREME CHOICE NOT GIVEN AGAIN
FOR NOW FROM MY HIGHEST BEING LOOKS AT THEE
THE NAMELESS FORMLESS PEACE WHERE ALL THINGS REST
IN A HAPPY VAST SUBLIME CESSATION KNOW
AN IMMENSE EXTINCTION IN ETERNITY
A POINT THAT DISAPPEARS IN THE INFINITE
FELICITY OF THE EXTINGUISHED FLAME
LAST SINKING OF A WAVE IN A BOUNDLESS SEA
END OF THE TROUBLE OF THY WANDERING THOUGHTS
CLOSE OF THE JOURNEYING OF THY PILGRIM SOUL
ACCEPT O MUSIC WEARINESS OF THY NOTES
O STREAM WIDE BREAKING OF THY CHANNEL BANKS
THE MOMENTS FELL INTO ETERNITY
BUT SOMEONE YEARNED WITHIN A BOSOM UNKNOWN
AND SILENTLY THE WOMAN'S HEART REPLIED
THY PEACE O LORD A BOON WITHIN TO KEEP
AMID THE ROAR AND RUIN OF WILD TIME
FOR THE MAGNIFICENT SOUL OF MAN ON EARTH
THY CALM O LORD THAT BEARS THY HANDS OF JOY
LIMITLESS LIKE OCEAN ROUND A LONELY ISLE
A SECOND TIME THE ETERNAL CRY AROSE
WIDE OPEN ARE THE INEFFABLE GATES IN FRONT
MY SPIRIT LEANS DOWN TO BREAK THE KNOT OF EARTH
AMOROUS OF ONENESS WITHOUT THOUGHT OR SIGN
TO CAST DOWN WALL AND FENCE TO STRIP HEAVEN BARE
SEE WITH THE LARGE EYE OF INFINITY
UNWEAVE THE STARS AND INTO SILENCE PASS
IN AN IMMENSE AND WORLD-DESTROYING PAUSE
SHE HEARD A MILLION CREATURES CRY TO HER
THROUGH THE TREMENDOUS STILLNESS OF HER THOUGHTS
697
IMMEASURABLY THE WOMAN'S NATURE SPOKE
THY ONENESS LORD IN MANY APPROACHING HEARTS
MY SWEET INFINITY OF THY NUMBERLESS SOULS
MIGHTILY RETREATING LIKE A SEA IN EBB
A THIRD TIME SWELLED THE GREAT ADMONISHING CALL
I SPREAD ABROAD THE REFUGE OF MY WINGS
OUT OF ITS INCOMMUNICABLE DEEPS
MY POWER LOOKS FORTH OF MIGHTIEST SPLENDOUR STILLED
INTO ITS MAJESTY OF SLEEP WITHDRAWN
ABOVE THE DREADFUL WHIRLINGS OF THE WORLD
A SOB OF THINGS WAS ANSWER TO THE VOICE
AND PASSIONATELY THE WOMAN'S HEART REPLIED
THY ENERGY LORD TO SEIZE ON WOMAN AND MAN
TO TAKE ALL THINGS AND CREATURES IN THEIR GRIEF
AND GATHER THEM INTO A MOTHER'S ARMS
SOLEMN AND DISTANT LIKE A SERAPH'S LYRE
A LAST GREAT TIME THE WARNING SOUND WAS HEARD
I OPEN THE WIDE EYE OF SOLITUDE
TO UNCOVER THE VOICELESS RAPTURE OF MY BLISS
WHERE IN A PURE AND EXQUISITE HUSH IT LIES
MOTIONLESS IN ITS SLUMBER OF ECSTASY
RESTING FROM THE SWEET MADNESS OF THE DANCE
OUT OF WHOSE BEAT THE THROB OF HEARTS WAS BORN
BREAKING THE SILENCE WITH APPEAL AND CRY
A HYMN OF ADORATION TIRELESS CLIMBED
A M USIC BEAT OF WINGED UNITING SOULS
THEN ALL THE WOMAN YEARNINGLY REPLIED
THY EMBRACE WHICH RENDS THE LIVING KNOT OF PAIN
THY JOY O LORD IN WHICH ALL CREATURES BREATHE
THY MAGIC FLOWING WATERS OF DEEP LOVE
THY SWEETNESS GIVE TO ME FOR EARTH AND MEN
THEN AFTER SILENCE A STILL BLISSFUL CRY
BEGAN SUCH AS AROSE FROM THE INFINITE
WHEN THE FIRST WHISPERINGS OF A STRANGE DELIGHT
IMAGINED IN ITS DEEP THE JOY TO SEEK
698
THE PASSION TO DISCOVER AND TO TOUCH
THE ENAMOURED LAUGH WHICH RHYMED THE CHANTING WORLDS
O BEAUTIFUL BODY OF THE INCARNATE WORD
THY THOUGHTS ARE MINE I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THY VOICE
MY WILL IS THINE WHAT THOU HAST CHOSEN I CHOOSE
ALL THOU HAST ASKED I GIVE TO EARTH AND MEN
ALL SHALL BE WRITTEN OUT IN DESTINY'S BOOK
BY MY TRUSTEE OF THOUGHT AND PLAN AND ACT
THE EXECUTOR OF MY WILL ETERNAL TIME
BUT SINCE THOU HAST REFUSED MY MAIMLESS CALM
AND TURNED FROM MY TERMLESS PEACE IN WHICH IS EXPUNGED
THE VISAGE OF SPACE AND THE SHAPE OF TIME IS LOST
AND FROM HAPPY EXTINCTION OF THY SEPARATE SELF
IN MY UNCOMPANIONED LONE ETERNITY
FOR NOT FOR THEE THE NAMELESS WORLDLESS NOUGHT
ANNIHILATION OF THY LIVING SOUL
AND THE END OF THOUGHT AND HOPE AND LIFE AND LOVE
IN THE BLANK MEASURELESS UNKNOWABLE
I LAY MY HANDS UPON THY SOUL OF FLAME
I LAY MY HANDS UPON THY HEART OF LOVE
I YOKE THEE TO MY POWER OF WORK IN TIME
BECAUSE THOU HAST OBEYED MY TIMELESS WILL
BECAUSE THOU HAST CHOSEN TO SHARE EARTH'S STRUGGLE AND FATE
AND LEANED IN PITY OVER EARTH-BOUND MEN
AND TURNED ASIDE TO HELP AND YEARNED TO SAVE
I BIND BY THY HEART'S PASSION THY HEART TO MINE
AND LAY MY SPLENDID YOKE UPON THY SOUL
NOW WILL I DO IN THEE MY MARVELLOUS WORKS
I WILL FASTEN THY NATURE WITH MY CORDS OF STRENGTH
SUBDUE TO MY DELIGHT THY SPIRIT'S LIMBS
AND MAKE THEE A VIVID KNOT OF ALL MY BLISS
AND BUILD IN THEE MY PROUD AND CRYSTAL HOME
THY DAYS SHALL BE MY SHAFTS OF POWER AND LIGHT
THY NIGHTS MY STARRY MYSTERIES OF JOY
AND ALL MY CLOUDS LIE TANGLED IN THY HAIR
AND ALL MY SPRINGTIDES MARRY IN THY MOUTH
699
O SUN-WORD THOU SHALT RAISE THE EARTH-SOUL TO LIGHT
AND BRING DOWN GOD INTO THE LIVES OF MEN
EARTH SHALL BE MY WORK-CHAMBER AND MY HOUSE
MY GARDEN OF LIFE TO PLANT A SEED DIVINE
WHEN ALL THY WORK IN HUMAN TIME IS DONE
THE MIND OF EARTH SHALL BE A HOME OF LIGHT
THE LIFE OF EARTH A TREE GROWING TOWARDS HEAVEN
THE BODY OF EARTH A TABERNACLE OF GOD
AWAKENED FROM THE MORTAL'S IGNORANCE
MEN SHALL BE LIT WITH THE ETERNAL'S RAY
AND THE GLORY OF MY SUN-LIFT IN THEIR THOUGHTS
AND FEEL IN THEIR HEARTS THE SWEETNESS OF MY LOVE
AND IN THEIR ACTS MY POWER'S MIRACULOUS DRIVE
MY WILL SHALL BE THE MEANING OF THEIR DAYS
LIVING FOR ME BY ME IN ME THEY SHALL LIVE
IN THE HEART OF MY CREATION'S MYSTERY
I WILL ENACT THE DRAMA OF THY SOUL
INSCRIBE THE LONG ROMANCE OF THEE AND ME
I WILL PURSUE THEE ACROSS THE CENTURIES
THOU SHALT BE HUNTED THROUGH THE WORLD BY LOVE
NAKED OF IGNORANCE' PROTECTING VEIL
AND WITHOUT COVERT FROM MY RADIANT GODS
NO SHAPE SHALL SCREEN THEE FROM MY DIVINE DESIRE
NOWHERE SHALT THOU ESCAPE MY LIVING EYES
IN THE NUDITY OF THY DISCOVERED SELF
IN A BARE IDENTITY WITH ALL THAT IS
DISROBED OF THY COVERING OF HUMANITY
DIVESTED OF THE DENSE VEIL OF HUMAN THOUGHT
MADE ONE WITH EVERY MIND AND BODY AND HEART
MADE ONE WITH ALL NATURE AND WITH SELF AND GOD
SUMMING IN THY SINGLE SOUL MY MYSTIC WORLD
I WILL POSSESS IN THEE MY UNIVERSE
THE UNIVERSE FIND ALL I AM IN THEE
THOU SHALT BEAR ALL THINGS THAT ALL THINGS MAY CHANGE
THOU SHALT FILL ALL WITH MY SPLENDOUR AND MY BLISS
THOU SHALT MEET ALL WITH THY TRANSMUTING SOUL
700
ASSAILED BY MY INFINITUDES ABOVE
AND QUIVERING IN IMMENSITIES BELOW
PURSUED BY ME THROUGH MY MIND'S WALL-LESS VAST
OCEANIC WITH THE SURGES OF MY LIFE
A SWIMMER LOST BETWEEN TWO LEAPING SEAS
BY MY OUTER PAINS AND INNER SWEETNESSES
FINDING MY JOY IN MY OPPOSITE MYSTERIES
THOU SHALT RESPOND TO ME FROM EVERY NERVE
A VISION SHALL COMPEL THY COURSING BREATH
THY HEART SHALL DRIVE THEE ON THE WHEEL OF WORKS
THY MIND SHALL URGE THEE THROUGH THE FLAMES OF THOUGHT
TO MEET ME IN THE ABYSS AND ON THE HEIGHTS
TO FEEL ME IN THE TEMPEST AND THE CALM
AND LOVE ME IN THE NOBLE AND THE VILE
IN BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND TERRIBLE DESIRE
THE PAINS OF HELL SHALL BE TO THEE MY KISS
THE FLOWERS OF HEAVEN PERSUADE THEE WITH MY TOUCH
MY FIERCEST MASKS SHALL MY ATTRACTIONS BRING
MUSIC SHALL FIND THEE IN THE VOICE OF SWORDS
BEAUTY PURSUE THEE THROUGH THE CORE OF FLAME
THOU SHALT KNOW ME IN THE ROLLING OF THE SPHERES
AND CROSS ME IN THE ATOMS OF THE WHIRL
THE WHEELING FORCES OF MY UNIVERSE
SHALL CRY TO THEE THE SUMMONS OF MY NAME
DELIGHT SHALL DROP DOWN FROM MY NECTAROUS MOON
MY FRAGRANCE SEIZE THEE IN THE JASMINE'S SNARE
MY EYE SHALL LOOK UPON THEE FROM THE SUN
MIRROR OF NATURE'S SECRET SPIRIT MADE
THOU SHALT REFLECT MY HIDDEN HEART OF JOY
THOU SHALT DRINK DOWN MY SWEETNESS UNALLOYED
IN MY PURE LOTUS-CUP OF STARRY BRIM
MY DREADFUL HANDS LAID ON THY BOSOM SHALL FORCE
THY BEING BATHED IN FIERCEST LONGING'S STREAMS
THOU SHALT DISCOVER THE ONE AND QUIVERING NOTE
AND CRY THE HARP OF ALL MY MELODIES
AND ROLL MY FOAMING WAVE IN SEAS OF LOVE
701
EVEN MY DISASTERS' CLUTCH SHALL BE TO THEE
THE ORDEAL OF MY RAPTURE'S CONTRARY SHAPE
IN PAIN'S SELF SHALL SMILE ON THEE MY SECRET FACE
THOU SHALT BEAR MY RUTHLESS BEAUTY UNABRIDGED
AMID THE WORLD'S INTOLERABLE WRONGS
TRAMPLED BY THE VIOLENT MISDEEDS OF TIME
CRY OUT TO THE ECSTASY OF MY RAPTURE'S TOUCH
ALL BEINGS SHALL BE TO THY LIFE MY EMISSARIES
DRAWN TO ME ON THE BOSOM OF THY FRIEND
COMPELLED TO MEET ME IN THY ENEMY'S EYES
MY CREATURES SHALL DEMAND ME FROM THY HEART
THOU SHALT NOT SHRINK FROM ANY BROTHER SOUL
THOU SHALT BE ATTRACTED HELPLESSLY TO ALL
MEN SEEING THEE SHALL FEEL MY HANDS OF JOY
IN SORROW'S PANGS FEEL STEPS OF THE WORLD'S DELIGHT
THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCE ITS TUMULTUOUS SHOCK
IN THE MUTUAL CRAVING OF TWO OPPOSITES
HEARTS TOUCHED BY THY LOVE SHALL ANSWER TO MY CALL
DISCOVER THE ANCIENT MUSIC OF THE SPHERES
IN THE REVEALING ACCENTS OF THY VOICE
AND NEARER DRAW TO ME BECAUSE THOU ART
ENAMOURED OF THY SPIRIT'S LOVELINESS
THEY SHALL EMBRACE MY BODY IN THY SOUL
HEAR IN THY LIFE THE BEAUTY OF MY LAUGH
KNOW THE THRILLED BLISS WITH WHICH I MADE THE WORLDS
ALL THAT THOU HAST SHALL BE FOR OTHERS' BLISS
ALL THAT THOU ART SHALL TO MY HANDS BELONG
I WILL POUR DELIGHT FROM THEE AS FROM A JAR
I WILL WHIRL THEE AS MY CHARIOT THROUGH THE WAYS
I WILL USE THEE AS MY SWORD AND AS MY LYRE
I WILL PLAY ON THEE MY MINSTRELSIES OF THOUGHT
AND WHEN THOU ART VIBRANT WITH ALL ECSTASY
AND WHEN THOU LIV'ST ONE SPIRIT WITH ALL THINGS
THEN WILL I SPARE THEE NOT MY LIVING FIRES
BUT MAKE THEE A CHANNEL FOR MY TIMELESS FORCE
MY HIDDEN PRESENCE LED THEE UNKNOWING ON
702
FROM THY BEGINNING IN EARTH'S VOICELESS BOSOM
THROUGH LIFE AND PAIN AND TIME AND WILL AND DEATH
THROUGH OUTER SHOCKS AND INNER SILENCES
ALONG THE MYSTIC ROADS OF SPACE AND TIME
TO THE EXPERIENCE WHICH ALL NATURE HIDES
WHO HUNTS AND SEIZES ME MY CAPTIVE GROWS
THIS SHALT THOU HENCEFORTH LEARN FROM THY HEART-BEATS
FOR EVER LOVE O BEAUTIFUL SLAVE OF GOD
O LASSO OF MY RAPTURE'S WIDENING NOOSE
BECOME MY CORD OF UNIVERSAL LOVE
THE SPIRIT ENSNARED BY THEE FORCE TO DELIGHT
OF CREATION'S ONENESS SWEET AND FATHOMLESS
COMPELLED TO EMBRACE MY MYRIAD UNITIES
AND ALL MY ENDLESS FORMS AND DIVINE SOULS
O MIND GROW FULL OF THE ETERNAL PEACE
O WORD CRY OUT THE IMMORTAL LITANY
BUILT IS THE GOLDEN TOWER THE FLAME-CHILD BORN
DESCEND TO LIFE WITH HIM THY HEART DESIRES
O SATYAVAN O LUMINOUS SAVITRI
I SENT YOU FORTH OF OLD BENEATH THE STARS
A DUAL POWER OF GOD IN AN IGNORANT WORLD
IN A HEDGED CREATION SHUT FROM LIMITLESS SELF
BRINGING DOWN GOD TO THE INSENTIENT GLOBE
LIFTING EARTH-BEINGS TO IMMORTALITY
IN THE WORLD OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND MY IGNORANCE
WHERE GOD IS UNSEEN AND ONLY IS HEARD A NAME
AND KNOWLEDGE IS TRAPPED IN THE BOUNDARIES OF MIND
AND LIFE IS HAULED IN THE DRAG-NET OF DESIRE
AND MATTER HIDES THE SOUL FROM ITS OWN SIGHT
YOU ARE MY FORCE AT WORK TO UPLIFT EARTH'S FATE
MY SELF THAT MOVES UP THE IMMENSE INCLINE
BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF THE SPIRIT'S NIGHT AND DAY
HE IS MY SOUL THAT CLIMBS FROM NESCIENT NIGHT
THROUGH LIFE AND MIND AND SUPERNATURE'S VAST
TO THE SUPERNAL LIGHT OF TIMELESSNESS
AND MY ETERNITY HID IN MOVING TIME
703
AND MY BOUNDLESSNESS CUT BY THE CURVE OF SPACE
IT CLIMBS TO THE GREATNESS IT HAS LEFT BEHIND
AND TO THE BEAUTY AND JOY FROM WHICH IT FELL
TO THE CLOSENESS AND SWEETNESS OF ALL THINGS DIVINE
TO LIGHT WITHOUT BOUNDS AND LIFE ILLIMITABLE
TASTE OF THE DEPTHS OF THE INEFFABLE'S BLISS
TOUCH OF THE IMMORTAL AND THE INFINITE
HE IS MY SOUL THAT GROPES OUT OF THE BEAST
TO REACH HUMANITY'S HEIGHTS OF LUCENT THOUGHT
AND THE VICINITY OF TRUTH'S SUBLIME
HE IS THE GODHEAD GROWING IN HUMAN LIVES
AND IN THE BODY OF EARTH-BEING'S FORMS
HE IS THE SOUL OF MAN CLIMBING TO GOD
IN NATURE'S SURGE OUT OF EARTH'S IGNORANCE
O SAVITRI THOU ART MY SPIRIT'S POWER
THE REVEALING VOICE OF MY IMMORTAL WORD
THE FACE OF TRUTH UPON THE ROADS OF TIME
POINTING TO THE SOULS OF MEN THE ROUTES TO GOD
WHILE THE DIM LIGHT FROM THE VEILED SPIRIT'S PEAK
FALLS UPON MATTER'S STARK INCONSCIENT SLEEP
AS IF A PALE MOONBEAM ON A DENSE GLADE
AND MIND IN A HALF-LIGHT MOVES AMID HALF-TRUTHS
AND THE HUMAN HEART KNOWS ONLY HUMAN LOVE
AND LIFE IS A STUMBLING AND IMPERFECT FORCE
AND THE BODY COUNTS OUT ITS PRECARIOUS DAYS
YOU SHALL BE BORN INTO MAN'S DUBIOUS HOURS
IN FORMS THAT HIDE THE SOUL'S DIVINITY
AND SHOW THROUGH VEILS OF THE EARTH'S DOUBTING AIR
MY GLORY BREAKING AS THROUGH CLOUDS A SUN
OR BURNING LIKE A RARE AND INWARD FIRE
AND WITH MY NAMELESS INFLUENCE FILL MEN'S LIVES
YET SHALL THEY LOOK UP AS TO PEAKS OF GOD
AND FEEL GOD LIKE A CIRCUMAMBIENT AIR
AND REST ON GOD AS ON A MOTIONLESS BASE
YET SHALL THERE GLOW ON MIND LIKE A HORNED MOON
THE SPIRIT'S CRESCENT SPLENDOUR IN PALE SKIES
704
AND LIGHT MAN'S LIFE UPON HIS GODWARD ROAD
BUT MORE THERE IS CONCEALED IN GOD'S BEYOND
THAT SHALL ONE DAY REVEAL ITS HIDDEN FACE
NOW MIND IS ALL AND ITS UNCERTAIN RAY
MIND IS THE LEADER OF THE BODY AND LIFE
MIND THE THOUGHT-DRIVEN CHARIOT OF THE SOUL
CARRYING THE LUMINOUS WANDERER IN THE NIGHT
TO VISTAS OF A FAR UNCERTAIN DAWN
TO THE END OF THE SPIRIT'S FATHOMLESS DESIRE
TO ITS DREAM OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND UTTER BLISS
THERE ARE GREATER DESTINIES MIND CANNOT SURMISE
FIXED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE EVOLVING PATH
THE TRAVELLER NOW TREADS IN THE IGNORANCE
UNAWARE OF HIS NEXT STEP NOT KNOWING HIS GOAL
MIND IS NOT ALL HIS TIRELESS CLIMB CAN REACH
THERE IS A FIRE ON THE APEX OF THE WORLDS
THERE IS A HOUSE OF THE ETERNAL'S LIGHT
THERE IS AN INFINITE TRUTH AN ABSOLUTE POWER
THE SPIRIT'S MIGHTINESS SHALL CAST OFF ITS MASK
ITS GREATNESS SHALL BE FELT SHAPING THE WORLD'S COURSE
IT SHALL BE SEEN IN ITS OWN VEILLESS BEAMS
A STAR RISING FROM THE INCONSCIENT'S NIGHT
A SUN CLIMBING TO SUPERNATURE'S PEAK
ABANDONING THE DUBIOUS MIDDLE WAY
A FEW SHALL GLIMPSE THE MIRACULOUS ORIGIN
AND SOME SHALL FEEL IN YOU THE SECRET FORCE
AND THEY SHALL TURN TO MEET A NAMELESS TREAD
ADVENTURERS INTO A MIGHTIER DAY
ASCENDING OUT OF THE LIMITING BREADTHS OF MIND
THEY SHALL DISCOVER THE WORLD'S HUGE DESIGN
AND STEP INTO THE TRUTH THE RIGHT THE VAST
YOU SHALL REVEAL TO THEM THE HIDDEN ETERNITIES
THE BREATH OF INFINITUDES NOT YET REVEALED
SOME RAPTURE OF THE BLISS THAT MADE THE WORLD
SOME RUSH OF THE FORCE OF GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE
SOME BEAM OF THE OMNISCIENT MYSTERY
705
BUT WHEN THE HOUR OF THE DIVINE DRAWS NEAR
THE MIGHTY MOTHER SHALL TAKE BIRTH IN TIME
AND GOD BE BORN INTO THE HUMAN CLAY
IN FORMS MADE READY BY YOUR HUMAN LIVES
THEN SHALL THE TRUTH SUPREME BE GIVEN TO MEN
THERE IS A BEING BEYOND THE BEING OF MIND
AN IMMEASURABLE CAST INTO MANY FORMS
A MIRACLE OF THE MULTITUDINOUS ONE
THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS MIND CANNOT TOUCH
ITS SPEECH CANNOT UTTER NOR ITS THOUGHT REVEAL
IT HAS NO HOME ON EARTH NO CENTRE IN MAN
YET IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS THOUGHT AND DONE
THE FOUNT OF THE CREATION AND ITS WORKS
IT IS THE ORIGIN OF ALL TRUTH HERE
THE SUN-ORB OF MIND'S FRAGMENTARY RAYS
INFINITY'S HEAVEN THAT SPILLS THE RAIN OF GOD
THE IMMENSE THAT CALLS TO MAN TO EXPAND THE SPIRIT
THE WIDE AIM THAT JUSTIFIES HIS NARROW ATTEMPTS
A CHANNEL FOR THE LITTLE HE TASTES OF BLISS
SOME SHALL BE MADE THE GLORY'S RECEPTACLES
AND VEHICLES OF THE ETERNAL'S LUMINOUS POWER
THESE ARE THE HIGH FORERUNNERS THE HEADS OF TIME
THE GREAT DELIVERERS OF EARTH-BOUND MIND
THE HIGH TRANSFIGURERS OF HUMAN CLAY
THE FIRST-BORN OF A NEW SUPERNAL RACE
THE INCARNATE DUAL POWER SHALL OPEN GOD'S DOOR
ETERNAL SUPERMIND TOUCH EARTHLY TIME
THE SUPERMAN SHALL WAKE IN MORTAL MAN
AND MANIFEST THE HIDDEN DEMIGOD
OR GROW INTO THE GOD-LIGHT AND GOD-FORCE
REVEALING THE SECRET DEITY IN THE CAVE
THEN SHALL THE EARTH BE TOUCHED BY THE SUPREME
HIS BRIGHT UNVEILED TRANSCENDENCE SHALL ILLUMINE
THE MIND AND HEART AND FORCE THE LIFE AND ACT
TO INTERPRET HIS INEXPRESSIBLE MYSTERY
IN A HEAVENLY ALPHABET OF DIVINITY'S SIGNS
706
HIS LIVING COSMIC SPIRIT SHALL ENRING
ANNULLING THE DECREE OF DEATH AND PAIN
ERASING THE FORMULAS OF THE IGNORANCE
WITH THE DEEP MEANING OF BEAUTY AND LIFE'S HID SENSE
THE BEING READY FOR IMMORTALITY
HIS REGARD CROSSING INFINITY'S MYSTIC WAVES
BRING BACK TO NATURE HER EARLY JOY TO LIVE
THE METRED HEART-BEATS OF A LOST DELIGHT
THE CRY OF A FORGOTTEN ECSTASY
THE DANCE OF THE FIRST WORLD-CREATING BLISS
THE IMMANENT SHALL BE THE WITNESS GOD
WATCHING ON HIS MANY-PETALLED LOTUS-THRONE
HIS ACTIONLESS BEING AND HIS SILENT MIGHT
RULING EARTH-NATURE BY ETERNITY'S LAW
A THINKER WAKING THE INCONSCIENT'S WORLD
AN IMMOBILE CENTRE OF MANY INFINITUDES
IN HIS THOUSAND-PILLARED TEMPLE BY TIME'S SEA
THEN SHALL THE EMBODIED BEING LIVE AS ONE
WHO IS A THOUGHT A WILL OF THE DIVINE
A MASK OR ROBE OF HIS DIVINITY
AN INSTRUMENT AND PARTNER OF HIS FORCE
A POINT OR LINE DRAWN IN THE INFINITE
A MANIFEST OF THE IMPERISHABLE
THE SUPERMIND SHALL BE HIS NATURE'S FOUNT
THE ETERNAL'S TRUTH SHALL MOULD HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTS
THE ETERNAL'S TRUTH SHALL BE HIS LIGHT AND GUIDE
ALL THEN SHALL CHANGE A MAGIC ORDER COME
OVERTOPPING THIS MECHANICAL UNIVERSE
A MIGHTIER RACE SHALL INHABIT THE MORTAL'S WORLD
ON NATURE'S LUMINOUS TOPS ON THE SPIRIT'S GROUND
THE SUPERMAN SHALL REIGN AS KING OF LIFE
MAKE EARTH ALMOST THE MATE AND PEER OF HEAVEN
AND LEAD TOWARDS GOD AND TRUTH MAN'S IGNORANT HEART
AND LIFT TOWARDS GODHEAD HIS MORTALITY
A POWER RELEASED FROM CIRCUMSCRIBING BOUNDS
ITS HEIGHT PUSHED UP BEYOND DEATH'S HUNGRY REACH
707
LIFE'S TOPS SHALL FLAME WITH THE IMMORTAL'S THOUGHTS
LIGHT SHALL INVADE THE DARKNESS OF ITS BASE
THEN IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLVING TIME
ALL SHALL BE DRAWN INTO A SINGLE PLAN
A DIVINE HARMONY SHALL BE EARTH'S LAW
BEAUTY AND JOY REMOULD HER WAY TO LIVE
EVEN THE BODY SHALL REMEMBER GOD
NATURE SHALL DRAW BACK FROM MORTALITY
AND SPIRIT'S FIRES SHALL GUIDE THE EARTH'S BLIND FORCE
KNOWLEDGE SHALL BRING INTO THE ASPIRANT THOUGHT
A HIGH PROXIMITY TO TRUTH AND GOD
THE SUPERMIND SHALL CLAIM THE WORLD FOR LIGHT
AND THRILL WITH LOVE OF GOD THE ENAMOURED HEART
AND PLACE LIGHT'S CROWN ON NATURE'S LIFTED HEAD
AND FOUND LIGHT'S REIGN ON HER UNSHAKING BASE
A GREATER TRUTH THAN EARTH'S SHALL ROOF-IN EARTH
AND SHED ITS SUNLIGHT ON THE ROADS OF MIND
A POWER INFALLIBLE SHALL LEAD THE THOUGHT
A SEEING PUISSANCE GOVERN LIFE AND ACT
IN EARTHLY HEARTS KINDLE THE IMMORTAL'S FIRE
A SOUL SHALL WAKE IN THE INCONSCIENT'S HOUSE
THE MIND SHALL BE GOD-VISION'S TABERNACLE
THE BODY INTUITION'S INSTRUMENT
AND LIFE A CHANNEL FOR GOD'S VISIBLE POWER
ALL EARTH SHALL BE THE SPIRIT'S MANIFEST HOME
HIDDEN NO MORE BY THE BODY AND THE LIFE
HIDDEN NO MORE BY THE MIND'S IGNORANCE
AN UNERRING HAND SHALL SHAPE EVENT AND ACT
THE SPIRIT'S EYES SHALL LOOK THROUGH NATURE'S EYES
THE SPIRIT'S FORCE SHALL OCCUPY NATURE'S FORCE
THIS WORLD SHALL BE GOD'S VISIBLE GARDEN-HOUSE
THE EARTH SHALL BE A FIELD AND CAMP OF GOD
MAN SHALL FORGET CONSENT TO MORTALITY
AND HIS EMBODIED FRAIL IMPERMANENCE
THIS UNIVERSE SHALL UNSEAL ITS OCCULT SENSE
CREATION'S PROCESS CHANGE ITS ANTIQUE FRONT
708
AN IGNORANT EVOLUTION'S HIERARCHY
RELEASE THE WISDOM CHAINED BELOW ITS BASE
THE SPIRIT SHALL BE THE MASTER OF HIS WORLD
LURKING NO MORE IN FORM'S OBSCURITY
AND NATURE SHALL REVERSE HER ACTION'S RULE
THE OUTWARD WORLD DISCLOSE THE TRUTH IT VEILS
ALL THINGS SHALL MANIFEST THE COVERT GOD
ALL SHALL REVEAL THE SPIRIT'S LIGHT AND MIGHT
AND MOVE TO ITS DESTINY OF FELICITY
EVEN SHOULD A HOSTILE FORCE CLING TO ITS REIGN
AND CLAIM ITS RIGHT'S PERPETUAL SOVEREIGNTY
AND MAN REFUSE HIS HIGH SPIRITUAL FATE
YET SHALL THE SECRET TRUTH IN THINGS PREVAIL
FOR IN THE MARCH OF ALL-FULFILLING TIME
THE HOUR MUST COME OF THE TRANSCENDENT'S WILL
ALL TURNS AND WINDS TOWARDS HIS PREDESTINED ENDS
IN NATURE'S FIXED INEVITABLE COURSE
DECREED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLDS
IN THE DEEP ESSENCE OF CREATED THINGS
EVEN THERE SHALL COME AS A HIGH CROWN OF ALL
THE END OF DEATH THE DEATH OF IGNORANCE
BUT FIRST HIGH TRUTH MUST SET HER FEET ON EARTH
AND MAN ASPIRE TO THE ETERNAL'S LIGHT
AND ALL HIS MEMBERS FEEL THE SPIRIT'S TOUCH
AND ALL HIS LIFE OBEY AN INNER FORCE
THIS TOO SHALL BE FOR A NEW LIFE SHALL COME
A BODY OF THE SUPERCONSCIENT'S TRUTH
A NATIVE FIELD OF SUPERNATURE'S MIGHTS
IT SHALL MAKE EARTH'S NESCIENT GROUND TRUTH'S COLONY
MAKE EVEN THE IGNORANCE A TRANSPARENT ROBE
THROUGH WHICH SHALL SHINE THE BRILLIANT LIMBS OF TRUTH
AND TRUTH SHALL BE A SUN ON NATURE'S HEAD
AND TRUTH SHALL BE THE GUIDE OF NATURE'S STEPS
AND TRUTH SHALL GAZE OUT OF HER NETHER DEEPS
WHEN SUPERMAN IS BORN AS NATURE'S KING
HIS PRESENCE SHALL TRANSFIGURE MATTER'S WORLD
709
HE SHALL LIGHT UP TRUTH'S FIRE IN NATURE'S NIGHT
HE SHALL LAY UPON THE EARTH TRUTH'S GREATER LAW
MAN TOO SHALL TURN TOWARDS THE SPIRIT'S CALL
AWAKE TO HIS HIDDEN POSSIBILITY
AWAKE TO ALL THAT SLEPT WITHIN HIS HEART
AND ALL THAT NATURE MEANT WHEN EARTH WAS FORMED
AND THE SPIRIT MADE THIS IGNORANT WORLD HIS HOME
HE SHALL ASPIRE TO TRUTH AND GOD AND BLISS
INTERPRETER OF A DIVINER LAW
AND INSTRUMENT OF A SUPREME DESIGN
THE HIGHER KIND SHALL LEAN TO LIFT UP MAN
MAN SHALL DESIRE TO CLIMB TO HIS OWN HEIGHTS
THE TRUTH ABOVE SHALL WAKE A NETHER TRUTH
EVEN THE DUMB EARTH BECOME A SENTIENT FORCE
THE SPIRIT'S TOPS AND NATURE'S BASE SHALL DRAW
NEAR TO THE SECRET OF THEIR SEPARATE TRUTH
AND KNOW EACH OTHER AS ONE DEITY
THE SPIRIT SHALL LOOK OUT THROUGH MATTER'S GAZE
AND MATTER SHALL REVEAL THE SPIRIT'S FACE
THEN MAN AND SUPERMAN SHALL BE AT ONE
AND ALL THE EARTH BECOME A SINGLE LIFE
EVEN THE MULTITUDE SHALL HEAR THE VOICE
AND TURN TO COMMUNE WITH THE SPIRIT WITHIN
AND STRIVE TO OBEY THE HIGH SPIRITUAL LAW
THIS EARTH SHALL STIR WITH IMPULSES SUBLIME
HUMANITY AWAKE TO DEEPEST SELF
NATURE THE HIDDEN GODHEAD RECOGNISE
EVEN THE MANY SHALL SOME ANSWER MAKE
AND BEAR THE SPLENDOUR OF THE DIVINE'S RUSH
AND HIS IMPETUOUS KNOCK AT UNSEEN DOORS
A HEAVENLIER PASSION SHALL UPHEAVE MEN'S LIVES
THEIR MIND SHALL SHARE IN THE INEFFABLE GLEAM
THEIR HEART SHALL FEEL THE ECSTASY AND THE FIRE
EARTH'S BODIES SHALL BE CONSCIOUS OF A SOUL
MORTALITY'S BONDSLAVES SHALL UNLOOSE THEIR BONDS
MERE MEN INTO SPIRITUAL BEINGS GROW
710
AND SEE AWAKE THE DUMB DIVINITY
INTUITIVE BEAMS SHALL TOUCH THE NATURE'S PEAKS
A REVELATION STIR THE NATURE'S DEPTHS
THE TRUTH SHALL BE THE LEADER OF THEIR LIVES
TRUTH SHALL DICTATE THEIR THOUGHT AND SPEECH AND ACT
THEY SHALL FEEL THEMSELVES LIFTED NEARER TO THE SKY
AS IF A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE GODS
FOR KNOWLEDGE SHALL POUR DOWN IN RADIANT STREAMS
AND EVEN DARKENED MIND QUIVER WITH NEW LIFE
AND KINDLE AND BURN WITH THE IDEAL'S FIRE
AND TURN TO ESCAPE FROM MORTAL IGNORANCE
THE FRONTIERS OF THE IGNORANCE SHALL RECEDE
MORE AND MORE SOULS SHALL ENTER INTO LIGHT
MINDS LIT INSPIRED THE OCCULT SUMMONER HEAR
AND LIVES BLAZE WITH A SUDDEN INNER FLAME
AND HEARTS GROW ENAMOURED OF DIVINE DELIGHT
AND HUMAN WILLS TUNE TO THE DIVINE WILL
THESE SEPARATE SELVES THE SPIRIT'S ONENESS FEEL
THESE SENSES OF HEAVENLY SENSE GROW CAPABLE
THE FLESH AND NERVES OF A STRANGE ETHEREAL JOY
AND MORTAL BODIES OF IMMORTALITY
A DIVINE FORCE SHALL FLOW THROUGH TISSUE AND CELL
AND TAKE THE CHARGE OF BREATH AND SPEECH AND ACT
AND ALL THE THOUGHTS SHALL BE A GLOW OF SUNS
AND EVERY FEELING A CELESTIAL THRILL
OFTEN A LUSTROUS INNER DAWN SHALL COME
LIGHTING THE CHAMBERS OF THE SLUMBERING MIND
A SUDDEN BLISS SHALL RUN THROUGH EVERY LIMB
AND NATURE WITH A MIGHTIER PRESENCE FILL
THUS SHALL THE EARTH OPEN TO DIVINITY
AND COMMON NATURES FEEL THE WIDE UPLIFT
ILLUMINE COMMON ACTS WITH THE SPIRIT'S RAY
AND MEET THE DEITY IN COMMON THINGS
NATURE SHALL LIVE TO MANIFEST SECRET GOD
THE SPIRIT SHALL TAKE UP THE HUMAN PLAY
THIS EARTHLY LIFE BECOME THE LIFE DIVINE
711
THE MEASURE OF THAT SUBTLE MUSIC CEASED
DOWN WITH A HURRIED SWIMMING FLOATING LAPSE
THROUGH UNSEEN WORLDS AND BOTTOMLESS SPACES FORCED
SANK LIKE A STAR THE SOUL OF SAVITRI
AMIDST A LAUGHTER OF UNEARTHLY LYRES
SHE HEARD AROUND HER NAMELESS VOICES CRY
TRIUMPHING AN INNUMERABLE SOUND
A CHOIR OF RUSHING WINDS TO MEET HER CAME
SHE BORE THE BURDEN OF INFINITY
AND FELT THE STIR OF ALL ETHEREAL SPACE
PURSUING HER IN HER FALL IMPLACABLY SWEET
A FACE WAS OVER HER WHICH SEEMED A YOUTH'S
SYMBOL OF ALL THE BEAUTY EYES SEE NOT
CROWNED AS WITH PEACOCK PLUMES OF GORGEOUS HUE
FRAMING A SAPPHIRE WHOSE HEART-DISTURBING SMILE
INSATIABLY ATTRACTED TO DELIGHT
VOLUPTUOUS TO THE EMBRACES OF HER SOUL
CHANGED IN ITS SHAPE YET RAPTUROUSLY THE SAME
IT GREW A WOMAN'S DARK AND BEAUTIFUL
LIKE A MOONED NIGHT WITH DRIFTING STAR-GEMMED CLOUDS
A SHADOWY GLORY AND A STORMY DEPTH
TURBULENT IN WILL AND TERRIBLE IN LOVE
EYES IN WHICH NATURE'S BLIND ECSTATIC LIFE
SPRANG FROM SOME SPIRIT'S PASSIONATE CONTENT
MISSIONED HER TO THE WHIRLING DANCE OF EARTH
AMIDST THE HEADLONG RAPTURE OF HER FALL
HELD LIKE A BIRD IN A CHILD'S SATISFIED HANDS
IN AN ENAMOURED GRASP HER SPIRIT STROVE
ADMITTING NO RELEASE TILL TIME SHOULD END
AND AS THE FRUIT OF THE MYSTERIOUS JOY
SHE KEPT WITHIN HER STRONG EMBOSOMING SOUL
LIKE A FLOWER HIDDEN IN THE HEART OF SPRING
THE SOUL OF SATYAVAN DRAWN DOWN BY HER
INEXTRICABLY IN THAT MIGHTY LAPSE
INVISIBLE HEAVENS IN A THRONGING FLIGHT
SOARED PAST HER AS SHE FELL THEN ALL THE BLIND
712
AND NEAR ATTRACTION OF THE EARTH COMPELLED
FEARFUL RAPIDITIES OF DOWNWARD BLISS
LOST IN THE GIDDY PRONENESS OF THAT SPEED
WHIRLED SINKING OVERCOME SHE DISAPPEARED
LIKE A LEAF SPINNING FROM THE TREE OF HEAVEN
IN BROAD UNCONSCIOUSNESS AS IN A POOL
A HOSPITABLE SOFTNESS DREW HER IN
INTO A WONDER OF MIRACULOUS DEPTHS
ABOVE HER CLOSED A DARKNESS OF GREAT WINGS
AND SHE WAS BURIED IN A MOTHER'S BREAST
THEN FROM A TIMELESS PLANE THAT WATCHES TIME
A SPIRIT GAZED OUT UPON DESTINY
IN ITS ENDLESS MOMENT SAW THE AGES PASS
ALL STILL WAS IN A SILENCE OF THE GODS
THE PROPHET MOMENT COVERED LIMITLESS SPACE
AND CAST INTO THE HEART OF HURRYING TIME
A DIAMOND LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL'S PEACE
A CRIMSON SEED OF GOD'S FELICITY
A GLANCE FROM THE GAZE FELL OF UNDYING LOVE
A WONDERFUL FACE LOOKED OUT WITH DEATHLESS EYES
A HAND WAS SEEN DRAWING THE GOLDEN BARS
THAT GUARD THE IMPERISHABLE SECRECIES
A KEY TURNED IN A MYSTIC LOCK OF TIME
BUT WHERE THE SILENCE OF THE GODS HAD PASSED
A GREATER HARMONY FROM THE STILLNESS BORN
SURPRISED WITH JOY AND SWEETNESS YEARNING HEARTS
AN ECSTASY AND A LAUGHTER AND A CRY
A POWER LEANED DOWN A HAPPINESS FOUND ITS HOME
OVER WIDE EARTH BROODED THE INFINITE BLISS
715
OUT OF ABYSMAL TRANCE HER SPIRIT WOKE
LAIN ON THE EARTH-MOTHER'S CALM INCONSCIENT BREAST
SHE SAW THE GREEN-CLAD BRANCHES LEAN ABOVE
GUARDING HER SLEEP WITH THEIR ENCHANTED LIFE
AND OVERHEAD A BLUE-WINGED ECSTASY
FLUTTERED FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH WITH HIGH-PITCHED CALL
INTO THE MAGIC SECRECY OF THE WOODS
PEERING THROUGH AN EMERALD LATTICE-WINDOW OF LEAVES
IN INDOLENT SKIES RECLINED THE THINNING DAY
TURNED TO ITS SLOW FALL INTO EVENING'S PEACE
SHE PRESSED THE LIVING BODY OF SATYAVAN
ON HER BODY'S WORDLESS JOY TO BE AND BREATHE
SHE BORE THE BLISSFUL BURDEN OF HIS HEAD
BETWEEN HER BREASTS' WARM LABOUR OF DELIGHT
THE WAKING GLADNESS OF HER MEMBERS FELT
THE WEIGHT OF HEAVEN IN HIS LIMBS A TOUCH
SUMMING THE WHOLE FELICITY OF THINGS
AND ALL HER LIFE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS LIFE
AND ALL HER BEING REJOICED ENFOLDING HIS
THE IMMENSE REMOTENESS OF HER TRANCE HAD PASSED
HUMAN SHE WAS ONCE MORE EARTH'S SAVITRI
YET FELT IN HER ILLIMITABLE CHANGE
A POWER DWELT IN HER SOUL TOO GREAT FOR EARTH
A BLISS LIVED IN HER HEART TOO LARGE FOR HEAVEN
LIGHT TOO INTENSE FOR THOUGHT AND LOVE TOO BOUNDLESS
FOR EARTH'S EMOTIONS LIT HER SKIES OF MIND
AND SPREAD THROUGH HER DEEP AND HAPPY SEAS OF SOUL
ALL THAT IS SACRED IN THE WORLD DREW NEAR
TO HER DIVINE PASSIVITY OF MOOD
A MARVELLOUS VOICE OF SILENCE BREATHED ITS THOUGHTS
ALL THINGS IN TIME AND SPACE SHE HAD TAKEN FOR HERS
716
IN HER THEY MOVED BY HER THEY LIVED AND WERE
THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD CLUNG TO HER FOR DELIGHT
CREATED FOR HER RAPT EMBRACE OF LOVE
NOW IN HER SPACELESS SELF RELEASED FROM BOUNDS
UNNUMBERED YEARS SEEMED MOMENTS LONG DRAWN OUT
THE BRILLIANT TIME-FLAKES OF ETERNITY
OUTWINGINGS OF A BIRD FROM ITS BRIGHT HOME
HER EARTHLY MORNS WERE RADIANT FLIGHTS OF JOY
BOUNDLESS SHE WAS A FORM OF INFINITY
ABSORBED NO LONGER BY THE MOMENT'S BEAT
HER SPIRIT THE UNENDING FUTURE FELT
AND LIVED WITH ALL THE UNBEGINNING PAST
HER LIFE WAS A DAWN'S VICTORIOUS OPENING
THE PAST AND UNBORN DAYS HAD JOINED THEIR DREAMS
OLD VANISHED EVES AND FAR ARRIVING NOONS
HINTED TO HER A VISION OF PRESCIENT HOURS
SUPINE IN MUSING BLISS SHE LAY AWHILE
GIVEN TO THE WONDER OF A WAKING TRANCE
HALF-RISEN THEN SHE SENT HER GAZE AROUND
AS IF TO RECOVER OLD SWEET TRIVIAL THREADS
OLD HAPPY THOUGHTS SMALL TREASURED MEMORIES
AND WEAVE THEM INTO ONE IMMORTAL DAY
EVER SHE HELD ON THE PARADISE OF HER BREAST
HER LOVER CHARMED INTO A FATHOMLESS SLEEP
LAIN LIKE AN INFANT SPIRIT UNAWARE
LULLED ON THE VERGE OF TWO CONSENTING WORLDS
BUT SOON SHE LEANED DOWN OVER HER LOVED TO CALL
HIS MIND BACK TO HER WITH HER TRAVELLING TOUCH
ON HIS CLOSED EYELIDS SETTLED WAS HER STILL LOOK
OF STRONG DELIGHT NOT YEARNING NOW BUT LARGE
WITH LIMITLESS JOY OR SOVEREIGN LAST CONTENT
PURE PASSIONATE WITH THE PASSION OF THE GODS
DESIRE STIRRED NOT ITS WINGS FOR ALL WAS MADE
AN OVERARCHING OF CELESTIAL RAYS
LIKE THE ABSORBED CONTROL OF SKY ON PLAIN
HEAVEN'S LEANING DOWN TO EMBRACE FROM ALL SIDES EARTH
717
A QUIET RAPTURE A VAST SECURITY
THEN SIGHING TO HER TOUCH THE SOFT-WINGED SLEEP
ROSE HOVERING FROM HIS FLOWERLIKE LIDS AND FLEW
MURMUROUS AWAY AWAKE HE FOUND HER EYES
WAITING FOR HIS AND FELT HER HANDS AND SAW
THE EARTH HIS HOME GIVEN BACK TO HIM ONCE MORE
AND HER MADE HIS AGAIN HIS PASSION'S ALL
WITH HIS ARMS' ENCIRCLING HOLD AROUND HER LOCKED
A LIVING KNOT TO MAKE POSSESSION CLOSE
HE MURMURED WITH HESITATING LIPS HER NAME
AND VAGUELY RECOLLECTING WONDER CRIED
WHENCE HAST THOU BROUGHT ME CAPTIVE BACK LOVE-CHAINED
TO THEE AND SUNLIGHT'S WALLS O GOLDEN BEAM
AND CASKET OF ALL SWEETNESS SAVITRI
GODHEAD AND WOMAN MOONLIGHT OF MY SOUL
FOR SURELY I HAVE TRAVELLED IN STRANGE WORLDS
BY THEE COMPANIONED A PURSUING SPIRIT
TOGETHER WE HAVE DISDAINED THE GATES OF NIGHT
I HAVE TURNED AWAY FROM THE CELESTIALS' JOY
AND HEAVEN'S INSUFFICIENT WITHOUT THEE
WHERE NOW HAS PASSED THAT FORMIDABLE SHAPE
WHICH ROSE AGAINST US THE SPIRIT OF THE VOID
CLAIMING THE WORLD FOR DEATH AND NOTHINGNESS
DENYING GOD AND SOUL OR WAS ALL A DREAM
OR A VISION SEEN IN A SPIRITUAL SLEEP
A SYMBOL OF THE OPPOSITIONS OF TIME
OR A MIND-LIT BEACON OF SIGNIFICANCE
IN SOME STRESS OF DARKNESS LIGHTING ON THE WAY
OR GUIDING A SWIMMER THROUGH THE STRAITS OF DEATH
OR FINDING WITH THE SUCCOUR OF ITS RAY
IN A GULLY MID THE CROWDED STREETS OF CHANCE
THE SOUL THAT INTO THE WORLD-ADVENTURE CAME
A SCOUT AND VOYAGER FROM ETERNITY
BUT SHE REPLIED OUR PARTING WAS THE DREAM
WE ARE TOGETHER WE LIVE O SATYAVAN
LOOK ROUND THEE AND BEHOLD GLAD AND UNCHANGED
718
OUR HOME THIS FOREST WITH ITS THOUSAND CRIES
AND THE WHISPER OF THE WIND AMONG THE LEAVES
AND THROUGH RIFTS IN EMERALD SCENE THE EVENING SKY
GOD'S CANOPY OF BLUE SHELTERING OUR LIVES
AND THE BIRDS CRYING FOR HEART'S HAPPINESS
WINGED POETS OF OUR SOLITARY REIGN
OUR FRIENDS ON EARTH WHERE WE ARE KING AND QUEEN
ONLY OUR SOULS HAVE LEFT DEATH'S NIGHT BEHIND
CHANGED BY A MIGHTY DREAM'S REALITY
ILLUMINED BY THE LIGHT OF SYMBOL WORLDS
AND THE STUPENDOUS SUMMIT SELF OF THINGS
AND STOOD AT GODHEAD'S GATES LIMITLESS FREE
THEN FILLED WITH THE GLORY OF THEIR HAPPINESS
THEY ROSE AND WITH SAFE CLINGING FINGERS LOCKED
HUNG ON EACH OTHER IN A SILENT LOOK
BUT HE WITH A NEW WONDER IN HIS HEART
AND A NEW FLAME OF WORSHIP IN HIS EYES
WHAT HIGH CHANGE IS IN THEE O SAVITRI BRIGHT
EVER THOU WAST A GODDESS STILL AND PURE
YET DEARER TO ME BY THY SWEET HUMAN PARTS
EARTH GAVE THEE MAKING THEE YET MORE DIVINE
MY ADORATION MASTERED MY DESIRE
BENT DOWN TO MAKE ITS SUBJECT MY DARING CLASPED
CLAIMING BY BODY AND SOUL MY LIFE'S ESTATE
RAPTURE'S POSSESSION LOVE'S SWEET PROPERTY
A STATUE OF SILENCE IN MY TEMPLED SPIRIT
A YEARNING GODHEAD AND A GOLDEN BRIDE
BUT NOW THOU SEEMST ALMOST TOO HIGH AND GREAT
FOR MORTAL WORSHIP TIME LIES BELOW THY FEET
AND THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMS ONLY A PART OF THEE
THY PRESENCE THE HUSHED HEAVEN I INHABIT
AND THOU LOOKST ON ME IN THE GAZE OF THE STARS
YET ART THE EARTHLY KEEPER OF MY SOUL
MY LIFE A WHISPER OF THY DREAMING THOUGHTS
MY MORNS A GLEAMING OF THY SPIRIT'S WINGS
AND DAY AND NIGHT ARE OF THY BEAUTY PART
719
HAST THOU NOT TAKEN MY HEART TO TREASURE IT
IN THE SECURE ENVIRONMENT OF THY BREAST
AWAKENED FROM THE SILENCE AND THE SLEEP
I HAVE CONSENTED FOR THY SAKE TO BE
BY THEE I HAVE GREATENED MY MORTAL ARC OF LIFE
BUT NOW FAR HEAVENS UNMAPPED INFINITUDES
THOU HAST BROUGHT ME THY ILLIMITABLE GIFT
IF TO FILL THESE THOU LIFT THY SACRED FLIGHT
MY HUMAN EARTH WILL STILL DEMAND THY BLISS
MAKE STILL MY LIFE THROUGH THEE A SONG OF JOY
AND ALL MY SILENCE WIDE AND DEEP WITH THEE
A HEAVENLY QUEEN CONSENTING TO HIS WILL
SHE CLASPED HIS FEET BY HER ENSHRINING HAIR
ENVELOPED IN A VELVET CLOAK OF LOVE
AND ANSWERED SOFTLY LIKE A MURMURING LUTE
ALL NOW IS CHANGED YET ALL IS STILL THE SAME
LO WE HAVE LOOKED UPON THE FACE OF GOD
OUR LIFE HAS OPENED WITH DIVINITY
WE HAVE BORNE IDENTITY WITH THE SUPREME
AND KNOWN HIS MEANING IN OUR MORTAL LIVES
OUR LOVE HAS GROWN GREATER BY THAT MIGHTY TOUCH
AND LEARNED ITS HEAVENLY SIGNIFICANCE
YET NOTHING IS LOST OF MORTAL LOVE'S DELIGHT
HEAVEN'S TOUCH FULFILS BUT CANCELS NOT OUR EARTH
OUR BODIES NEED EACH OTHER IN THE SAME LAST
STILL IN OUR BREASTS REPEAT HEAVENLY SECRET RHYTHM
OUR HUMAN HEART-BEATS PASSIONATELY CLOSE
STILL AM I SHE WHO CAME TO THEE MID THE MURMUR
OF SUNLIT LEAVES UPON THIS FOREST VERGE
I AM THE MADRAN I AM SAVITRI
ALL THAT I WAS BEFORE I AM TO THEE STILL
CLOSE COMRADE OF THY THOUGHTS AND HOPES AND TOILS
ALL HAPPY CONTRARIES I WOULD JOIN FOR THEE
ALL SWEET RELATIONS MARRY IN OUR LIFE
I AM THY KINGDOM EVEN AS THOU ART MINE
THE SOVEREIGN AND THE SLAVE OF THY DESIRE
720
THY PRONE POSSESSOR SISTER OF THY SOUL
AND MOTHER OF THY WANTS THOU ART MY WORLD
THE EARTH I NEED THE HEAVEN MY THOUGHTS DESIRE
THE WORLD I INHABIT AND THE GOD I ADORE
THY BODY IS MY BODY'S COUNTERPART
WHOSE EVERY LIMB MY ANSWERING LIMB DESIRES
WHOSE HEART IS KEY TO ALL MY HEART-BEATS THIS
I AM AND THOU TO ME O SATYAVAN
OUR WEDDED WALK THROUGH LIFE BEGINS ANEW
NO GLADNESS LOST NO DEPTH OF MORTAL JOY
LET US GO THROUGH THIS NEW WORLD THAT IS THE SAME
FOR IT IS GIVEN BACK BUT IT IS KNOWN
A PLAYING-GROUND AND DWELLING-HOUSE OF GOD
WHO HIDES HIMSELF IN BIRD AND BEAST AND MAN
SWEETLY TO FIND HIMSELF AGAIN BY LOVE
BY ONENESS HIS PRESENCE LEADS THE RHYTHMS OF LIFE
THAT SEEK FOR MUTUAL JOY IN SPITE OF PAIN
WE HAVE EACH OTHER FOUND O SATYAVAN
IN THE GREAT LIGHT OF THE DISCOVERED SOUL
LET US GO BACK FOR EVE IS IN THE SKIES
NOW GRIEF IS DEAD AND SERENE BLISS REMAINS
THE HEART OF ALL OUR DAYS FOR EVERMORE
LO ALL THESE BEINGS IN THIS WONDERFUL WORLD
LET US GIVE JOY TO ALL FOR JOY IS OURS
FOR NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE OUR SPIRITS CAME
OUT OF THE VEIL OF THE UNMANIFEST
OUT OF THE DEEP IMMENSE UNKNOWABLE
UPON THE IGNORANT BREAST OF DUBIOUS EARTH
INTO THE WAYS OF LABOURING SEEKING MEN
TWO FIRES THAT BURN TOWARDS THAT PARENT SUN
TWO RAYS THAT TRAVEL TO THE ORIGINAL LIGHT
TO LEAD MAN'S SOUL TOWARDS TRUTH AND GOD WE ARE BORN
TO DRAW THE CHEQUERED SCHEME OF MORTAL LIFE
INTO SOME SEMBLANCE OF THE IMMORTAL'S PLAN
TO SHAPE IT CLOSER TO AN IMAGE OF GOD
A LITTLE NEARER TO THE IDEA DIVINE
721
SHE CLOSED HER ARMS ABOUT HIS BREAST AND HEAD
AS IF TO KEEP HIM ON HER BOSOM WORN
FOR EVER THROUGH THE JOURNEYING OF THE YEARS
SO FOR A WHILE THEY STOOD ENTWINED THEIR KISS
AND PASSION-TRANCED EMBRACE A MEETING-POINT
IN THEIR COMMINGLING SPIRITS ONE FOR EVER
TWO-SOULED TWO-BODIED FOR THE JOYS OF TIME
THEN HAND IN HAND THEY LEFT THAT SOLEMN PLACE
FULL NOW OF MUTE UNUSUAL MEMORIES
TO THE GREEN DISTANCE OF THEIR SYLVAN HOME
RETURNING SLOWLY THROUGH THE FOREST'S HEART
ROUND THEM THE AFTERNOON TO EVENING CHANGED
LIGHT SLIPPED DOWN TO THE BRIGHTLY SLEEPING VERGE
AND THE BIRDS CAME BACK WINGING TO THEIR NESTS
AND DAY AND NIGHT LEANED TO EACH OTHER'S ARMS
NOW THE DUSK SHADOWY TREES STOOD CLOSE AROUND
LIKE DREAMING SPIRITS AND DELAYING NIGHT
THE GREY-EYED PENSIVE EVENING HEARD THEIR STEPS
AND FROM ALL POINTS THE CRIES AND MOVEMENTS CAME
OF THE FOUR-FOOTED WANDERERS OF THE NIGHT
APPROACHING THEN A HUMAN RUMOUR ROSE
LONG ALIEN TO THEIR SOLITARY DAYS
INVADING THE CHARMED WILDERNESS OF LEAVES
ONCE SACRED TO SECLUDED LONELINESS
WITH VIOLENT BREAKING OF ITS VIRGIN SLEEP
THROUGH THE SCREENED DUSK IT DEEPENED STILL AND THERE NEARED
FLOATING OF MANY VOICES AND THE SOUND
OF MANY FEET TILL ON THEIR SIGHT BROKE IN
AS IF A COLOURED WAVE UPON THE EYE
THE BRILLIANT STRENUOUS CROWDED DAYS OF MAN
TOPPED BY A FLARING MULTITUDE OF LIGHTS
A GREAT RESPLENDENT COMPANY ARRIVED
LIFE IN ITS ORDERED TUMULT WAVERING CAME
BRINGING ITS STREAM OF UNKNOWN FACES THRONGED
WITH GOLD-FRINGED HEADDRESSES GOLD-BROIDERED ROBES
722
GLITTERING OF ORNAMENTS FLUTTERING OF HEMS
HUNDREDS OF HANDS PARTED THE FOREST-BOUGHS
HUNDREDS OF EYES SEARCHED THE ENTANGLED GLADES
CALM WHITE-CLAD PRIESTS THEIR GRAVE-EYED SWEETNESS BROUGHT
STRONG WARRIORS IN THEIR GLORIOUS ARMOUR SHONE
THE PROUD-HOOVED STEEDS CAME TRAMPLING THROUGH THE WOOD
IN FRONT KING DYUMATSENA WALKED NO MORE
BLIND FALTERING-LIMBED BUT HIS FAR-QUESTING EYES
RESTORED TO ALL THEIR CONFIDENCE IN LIGHT
TOOK SEEINGLY THIS IMAGED OUTER WORLD
FIRMLY HE TROD WITH MONARCH STEP THE SOIL
BY HIM THAT QUEEN AND MOTHER'S ANXIOUS FACE
CAME CHANGED FROM ITS HABITUAL BURDENED LOOK
WHICH IN ITS DROOPING STRENGTH OF TIRED TOIL
HAD BORNE THE FALLEN LIFE OF THOSE SHE LOVED
HER PATIENT PALENESS WORE A PENSIVE GLOW
LIKE EVENING'S SUBDUED GAZE OF GATHERED LIGHT
DEPARTING WHICH FORESEES SUNRISE HER CHILD
SINKING IN QUIET SPLENDOURS OF HER SKY
SHE LIVES AWHILE TO MUSE UPON THAT HOPE
THE BRILLIANCE OF HER RICH RECEDING GLEAM
A THOUGHTFUL PROPHECY OF LYRIC DAWN
HER EYES WERE FIRST TO FIND HER CHILDREN'S FORMS
BUT AT THE VISION OF THE BEAUTIFUL TWAIN
THE AIR AWOKE PERTURBED WITH SCALING CRIES
AND THE SWIFT PARENTS HURRYING TO THEIR CHILD
THEIR CAUSE OF LIFE NOW WHO HAD GIVEN HIM BREATH
POSSESSED HIM WITH THEIR ARMS THEN TENDERLY
CRIED DYUMATSENA CHIDING SATYAVAN
THE FORTUNATE GODS HAVE LOOKED ON ME TODAY
A KINGDOM SEEKING CAME AND HEAVEN'S RAYS
BUT WHERE WAST THOU THOU HAST TORMENTED GLADNESS
WITH FEAR'S DULL SHADOW O MY CHILD MY LIFE
WHAT DANGER KEPT THEE FOR THE DARKENING WOODS
OR HOW COULD PLEASURE IN HER WAYS FORGET
THAT USELESS ORBS WITHOUT THEE ARE MY EYES
723
WHICH ONLY FOR THY SAKE REJOICE AT LIGHT
NOT LIKE THYSELF WAS THIS DONE SAVITRI
WHO LEDST NOT BACK THY HUSBAND TO OUR ARMS
KNOWING WITH HIM BESIDE ME ONLY IS TASTE
IN FOOD AND FOR HIS TOUCH EVENING AND MORN
I LIVE CONTENT WITH MY REMAINING DAYS
BUT SATYAVAN REPLIED WITH SMILING LIPS
LAY ALL ON HER SHE IS THE CAUSE OF ALL
WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS SHE HAS TWINED ME ROUND
BEHOLD AT NOON LEAVING THIS HOUSE OF CLAY
I WANDERED IN FAR-OFF ETERNITIES
YET STILL A CAPTIVE IN HER GOLDEN HANDS
I TREAD YOUR LITTLE HILLOCK CALLED GREEN EARTH
AND IN THE MOMENTS OF YOUR TRANSIENT SUN
LIVE GLAD AMONG THE BUSY WORKS OF MEN
THEN ALL EYES TURNED THEIR WONDERING LOOKS WHERE STOOD
A DEEPENING REDDER GOLD UPON HER CHEEKS
WITH LOWERED LIDS THE NOBLE LOVELY CHILD
AND ONE CONSENTING THOUGHT MOVED EVERY BREAST
WHAT GLEAMING MARVEL OF THE EARTH OR SKIES
STANDS SILENTLY BY HUMAN SATYAVAN
TO MARK A BRILLIANCE IN THE DUSK OF EVE
IF THIS IS SHE OF WHOM THE WORLD HAS HEARD
WONDER NO MORE AT ANY HAPPY CHANGE
EACH EASY MIRACLE OF FELICITY
OF HER TRANSMUTING HEART THE ALCHEMY IS
THEN ONE SPOKE THERE WHO SEEMED A PRIEST AND SAGE
O WOMAN SOUL WHAT LIGHT WHAT POWER REVEALED
WORKING THE RAPID MARVELS OF THIS DAY
OPENS FOR US BY THEE A HAPPIER AGE
HER LASHES FLUTTERING UPWARDS GATHERED IN
TO A VISION WHICH HAD SCANNED IMMORTAL THINGS
REJOICING HUMAN FORMS FOR THEIR DELIGHT
THEY CLAIMED FOR THEIR DEEP CHILDLIKE MOTHERHOOD
THE LIFE OF ALL THESE SOULS TO BE HER LIFE
THEN FALLING VEILED THE LIGHT LOW SHE REPLIED
724
AWAKENED TO THE MEANING OF MY HEART
THAT TO FEEL LOVE AND ONENESS IS TO LIVE
AND THIS THE MAGIC OF OUR GOLDEN CHANGE
IS ALL THE TRUTH I KNOW OR SEEK O SAGE
WONDERING AT HER AND HER TOO LUMINOUS WORDS
WESTWARD THEY TURNED IN THE FAST-GATHERING NIGHT
FROM THE ENTANGLING VERGES FREED THEY CAME
INTO A DIMNESS OF THE SLEEPING EARTH
AND TRAVELLED THROUGH HER FAINT AND SLUMBERING PLAINS
MURMUR AND MOVEMENT AND THE TREAD OF MEN
BROKE THE NIGHT'S SOLITUDE THE NEIGH OF STEEDS
ROSE FROM THAT INDISTINCT AND VOICEFUL SEA
OF LIFE AND ALL ALONG ITS MARCHINGS SWELLED
THE RHYME OF HOOVES THE CHARIOT'S HOMEWARD VOICE
DRAWN BY WHITE MANES UPON A HIGH-ROOFED CAR
IN FLARE OF THE UNSTEADY TORCHES WENT
WITH LINKED HANDS SATYAVAN AND SAVITRI
HEARING A MARRIAGE MARCH AND NUPTIAL HYMN
WHERE WAITED THEM THE MANY-VOICED HUMAN WORLD
NUMBERLESS THE STARS SWAM ON THEIR SHADOWY FIELD
DESCRIBING IN THE GLOOM THE WAYS OF LIGHT
THEN WHILE THEY SKIRTED YET THE SOUTHWARD VERGE
LOST IN THE HALO OF HER MUSING BROWS
NIGHT SPLENDID WITH THE MOON DREAMING IN HEAVEN
IN SILVER PEACE POSSESSED HER LUMINOUS REIGN
SHE BROODED THROUGH HER STILLNESS ON A THOUGHT
DEEP-GUARDED BY HER MYSTIC FOLDS OF LIGHT
AND IN HER BOSOM NURSED A GREATER DAWN
