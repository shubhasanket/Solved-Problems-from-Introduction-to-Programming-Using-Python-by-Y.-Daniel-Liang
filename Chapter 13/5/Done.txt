ssssssssssssence and engineering are based on measurements and comparisons.
Thus, we need rules about how things are measured and compared, and we need
experiments to establish the units for those measurements and comparisons. One
purpose of physics (and engineering) is to design and conduct those experiments.
For example, physicists strive to develop clocks of extreme accuracy so that
any time or time interval can be precisely determined and compared. You may
wonder whether such accuracy is actually needed or worth the effort. Here is
one example of the worth: Without clocks of extreme accuracy, the Global
Positioning System (GPS) that is now vital to worldwide navigation would be useless.
